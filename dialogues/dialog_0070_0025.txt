DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… I want to know more about where my people come from. My family, that is. I hear you can do… a test. A DNA test? To see where we really started. I'm Laury Scobie.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you’re interested in learning about your ancestry – specifically, exploring your family’s origins through genetic testing. That’s certainly something we can discuss. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any health concerns at all today, or is this solely regarding your ancestry?
PATIENT: No, no health trouble. Just… curious. Always been curious. My grandma, she told stories… about the islands. But stories get lost, you know? I want to know. Not just hear. Does that make sense? This test… it tells you where the stories really come from?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Scobie. It’s perfectly natural to want to connect with your roots and verify family history with more than just stories. And yes, that is precisely what these genetic ancestry tests can help with. They analyze your DNA and compare it to reference populations around the world to estimate your ethnic origins and trace your ancestral migration patterns. However, it’s important to understand what these tests can and cannot do. They provide an estimate based on current data, and the accuracy can vary. They won't tell you everything, and they don't capture the full complexity of family history. Before we proceed, let’s talk a little bit about your family’s background as you know it. You mentioned your grandmother’s stories about the islands. Could you tell me more about those?
PATIENT: She… she talked about Majuro. That's the big island. Lots of coconut trees, blue water. And fishing, always fishing. She said our people came from other islands too, long time ago. Before the Americans came. But she didn’t say which islands. Just… other islands. We always lived near the ocean. That's all I really know. My father didn't talk much about it. He just… worked. Making things with wood. Like me. It's hard to remember everything now. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Scobie. Majuro is a beautiful place, and it sounds like your family has a strong connection to the ocean and fishing traditions. It’s also not uncommon for oral histories to be fragmented or incomplete, especially over time. So, to summarize, you’re interested in exploring your ancestry, with known roots in the Marshall Islands, specifically around Majuro, and a potential history of migration from other islands. Before discussing the DNA test itself, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of your medical history. This is standard procedure, even when the primary concern isn’t a health issue. It helps us interpret any potential findings in the context of your overall well-being. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I didn’t think it needed all that. Just… the stories. But, alright. If you need to know. I don’t have much trouble, really. Just getting old. A little tired sometimes. And my knees… they ache when the weather is bad. But that's just old age, I guess. What kind of questions?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel that it's not necessary, Mr. Scobie, but it's a precaution we take with all patients. Certain genetic predispositions can sometimes influence health conditions, and knowing your medical background helps us provide the most comprehensive care, even in this situation. It doesn't need to be a lengthy process, I assure you. Let's start with medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… what the doctor gives me. For my blood pressure. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think? The store kind. That’s all. I don’t like taking too many pills. Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you take medication for your blood pressure and ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain. That’s good to know. Do you happen to know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I get it from the pharmacy… It’s a little blue one… and it has… numbers on it, I think? I'm not good with names. My son, he always gets it for me. I just tell him I need my blood pressure pills. He knows what to do. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could remember.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s common to not remember medication names. We can likely obtain that information from your pharmacy with your permission. Next, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My grandma… she made a lot of fish. And coconut. And breadfruit. Never had any trouble. Never been sick from food, that I can remember. And no, no allergies to anything else. Not even bee stings or anything like that. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Scobie. No known allergies is certainly helpful. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… When I was a little boy, I had a bad fever. Very bad. I was sick for many days. But that was a long time ago. And… once, I broke my arm. Fell out of a tree when I was trying to get a coconut. But that's it. Nothing serious. Nothing since then. Old age is the worst sickness, I think.
DOCTOR: A childhood fever and a broken arm… that's good to know. And you're right, getting older does come with its challenges. Now, Mr. Scobie, let's talk briefly about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other illnesses that your parents, siblings, or other close relatives have had?
PATIENT: My mother… she got sick when she was old. Very weak. The doctor said it was her heart. She was always tired. And my father… he worked hard. Always working with wood. He got a cough when he was old. A bad cough. But that’s all I really remember. My brother… he moved away a long time ago. I haven't seen him in many years. I don't know what happened to him. Not much sickness in my family, I don't think. Just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of heart condition in your mother and a cough in your father. Thank you for sharing that information with me, Mr. Scobie. Now, before we discuss the DNA test itself, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. My grandma… she didn’t like smoking. She said it was bad for your lungs. And my father… he didn’t smoke either. Always too busy working. Never had the time. And me… I just never started. Bad habit, I think.
DOCTOR: Good, that's excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little sometimes. On Sundays, maybe. With my dinner. Just a small glass of wine. Nothing much. My grandma used to make it, from the coconuts. It wasn’t very strong. Just to relax, you know? Nothing like the young people drink now.
DOCTOR: Just a small glass of wine occasionally. That's good to know. Now, finally, let’s talk about your work and activities. What do you do with your time?
PATIENT: I make things with wood. Still do. That’s what I’ve always done. Little boats, little birds, little… whatever people want. I sell them at the market sometimes. And I fish. When I can. Not as much as I used to. It’s hard work now. And… I sit. I sit a lot. And think about my grandma. And the islands. That’s all. Not much excitement. But it’s a good life. Simple.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Scobie. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, regarding your interest in the DNA ancestry test… there are several reputable companies that offer these services. They typically involve sending in a saliva sample, and the results are available online in a few weeks. However, it’s important to understand the limitations. These tests provide an estimate of your ethnic origins based on comparisons to reference populations. The accuracy can vary, and the results are not always definitive. They can also be influenced by factors such as your ancestry and the size of the reference databases. Do you have any questions about the test itself, or would you like me to provide you with information about some reputable companies?
PATIENT: Hmm… so it's not… for sure? Not like knowing? Just… guessing? I was hoping it would tell me exactly where my people came from. But if it’s just guessing… I don’t know. Maybe it’s not worth it. I just want to know. Not just a maybe. Is there anything else I can do? Like… talk to someone who knows about the islands? Someone who remembers?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Scobie. You’re right to want certainty, and it’s important to be realistic about what these tests can provide. They’re not a replacement for firsthand knowledge or oral histories, but rather a tool that can supplement them. They can provide clues and insights, but they shouldn’t be considered definitive proof. As for finding someone who remembers the islands… that’s a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, I don't have a direct connection to individuals with extensive knowledge of Marshallese history, but I can certainly point you towards some resources that might be helpful. There’s a local cultural center downtown that often hosts events and workshops on Pacific Islander cultures. They may be able to connect you with community elders or historians. I can provide you with their contact information. Also, I know there's a professor at the state university who specializes in Pacific Islander studies. I can see if I can get you a referral to him. Would either of those options be of interest to you?
PATIENT: Yes! Both, if you can. The cultural center sounds good. And the professor… maybe he knows stories. Maybe he knows my grandma's stories! That would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I think… I think I’d rather talk to people. Than just look at a paper with maybe answers.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I completely understand. Connecting with people and hearing their stories is often much more meaningful than any test result. I’ll write down the contact information for the cultural center and the professor for you. Here you go. The cultural center has a website with their event schedule, and the professor’s contact information is listed here. I’ll also make a note in your chart to follow up with you in a few weeks to see if you were able to connect with them. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you. I feel better now. Less… lost. Maybe I’ll find some answers after all. Not from a test, but from people. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you're on the right track. Remember, your family’s story is valuable, regardless of where it comes from. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day as well, and I hope you have success in connecting with the cultural center and the professor.
