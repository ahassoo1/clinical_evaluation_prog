DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, a friend suggested I come talk to you. It’s about… well, she said there's a way to help prevent HIV, even if you don't… you know… have it already. She called it PrEP, I think? I'm just trying to be careful. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: PrEP… yes, we do offer PrEP, and preventative counseling. It’s good you're thinking ahead. A sensible friend you have. Now, let's get some details. First, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Um… yes. Not a lot, but yes. It's… complicated. I'm single, been that way for a while. It’s not regular, but I do… date. And I want to be safe. Does that make sense? I don’t want to get into details, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Details aren’t always necessary. But we do need a general picture. How many partners have you had in the last six months, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… maybe three? It's hard to keep track, honestly. It hasn’t been many, and I mostly meet people online, if that matters. It's just… I don’t always know everything about them, you know? That's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Online dating… right. It does complicate things. And you haven't been previously tested for HIV, I presume?
PATIENT: No, never. I always meant to, but… life gets in the way, you know? It’s embarrassing to admit, I guess. I just… I haven't been risky, but I also haven't been careful enough, maybe. So I figured it was best to get checked and see about this PrEP thing.
DOCTOR: Well, it's better late than never. We'll need a full panel of tests before we can even consider PrEP. HIV, of course, but also syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B, and a kidney function test. Routine things. And a physical exam. Let’s start with your medical history. Any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Good. Um… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, ages ago. And I had pneumonia once, really bad, a few years back. Otherwise… not much. I have high blood pressure, it’s controlled with medication. And arthritis, mostly in my hands. That’s about it, I think. I get regular checkups with my family doctor, but… he doesn’t really talk about… this kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Appendix, pneumonia, hypertension, arthritis… alright. What medication do you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for… oh, maybe five years now? It works pretty well, keeps the numbers down. Is that something important? I always forget the names of everything!
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20mg… yes, good to know. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can take pretty much anything they give me, as far as I’m aware. No food allergies either, knock on wood. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any family history of… significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, type 2. And her sister, my aunt, had heart disease. My father… he died young, a car accident. I don't really know much about his side of the family, honestly. We weren’t close. Does that help? It’s not a very… medical family, if that makes sense. We mostly just avoided the doctor when we could.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes and heart disease noted. Now, before we proceed with the tests, I need to explain the potential risks and benefits of PrEP, and ensure you understand them fully. It’s not without its side effects, you know. It requires regular monitoring, and it doesn’t protect against everything. Are you prepared to hear the details?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I want to know everything. I wouldn’t want to start anything without understanding what I’m getting into. I’m a grown woman, and I need to be informed. The side effects… and the monitoring… tell me everything. It's important.
DOCTOR: Very well. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication – typically Truvada or Descovy – taken daily to prevent HIV infection. It's highly effective when taken consistently, reducing your risk by over 90%. However, it only protects against HIV when you take it every day. Missing doses significantly reduces its effectiveness. As for side effects, the most common are mild nausea, diarrhea, headache, and fatigue. These usually subside within the first few weeks of starting treatment. Less common, but more serious, side effects include kidney problems and decreased bone density. That's why we need to monitor your kidney function and bone density regularly - blood tests every three months, and a bone scan annually. It’s also crucial to understand that PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections – syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes. You will still need to practice safe sex – condoms are essential – and get tested for STIs regularly, even while on PrEP. Are you following me so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. That’s… a lot to take in. Daily pills, side effects, kidney tests… and it doesn't protect against everything. That's… sobering. The kidney tests, that worries me a little, with my blood pressure. So, even if I take the pill every day, I still need condoms? That seems like… a lot of effort. But… if it keeps me safe, I guess. I just… I was hoping for a simpler solution, maybe. Is there anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: It's not a perfect solution, no. Nothing is. Your concerns are valid. The kidney function tests are important given your hypertension, but we'll monitor closely. And yes, condoms are always recommended, even on PrEP, to protect against other STIs. Consider it a layered approach to protection. Now, before we move forward, I want to do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, check your lymph nodes… just to get a baseline. And then we'll order the blood tests. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. A physical exam sounds… sensible. Get a baseline. I guess it's better to be thorough. As long as it doesn't take too long… I have a hair appointment later. But… yes, go ahead. Get it over with. The sooner I know where I stand, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just step over here. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's listen to your lungs… Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. And now, let's palpate your lymph nodes… No significant swelling. Everything feels… within normal limits, for now. Now, I’ll need a blood sample. I'll order the HIV antibody test, syphilis screen, gonorrhea and chlamydia testing, hepatitis B surface antigen, and a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. The lab technician will draw it now. It will take a few days to get the results back. Do you have any questions before I leave to get the lab orders sent?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And… what happens if something is wrong? I'm a little scared, to be honest. It's been a long time since I've had a proper checkup.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 3 to 5 business days. The lab will notify my office as soon as they're available, and my assistant will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. If something is wrong, we’ll discuss your options. For HIV, we have very effective treatments available. For other STIs, we have antibiotics. And if your kidney function is compromised, we can adjust your blood pressure medication and monitor you closely. We will address any issues as they arise, and I will guide you through the process. Don’t panic. We're taking a proactive step here, and early detection is always best. Okay, the lab orders are sent. The technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll see you again in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – fever, fatigue, rash – please call my office immediately. Do you have any final questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. It’s… a lot to process, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I hope everything is okay. I’m ready for the blood draw, I guess. Just… get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The technician will be with you momentarily. We’ll take it one step at a time.
