DOCTOR: Right, well, let's get this over with. Sasha Queener, 59… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… my leg. It’s been swelling up. After the… you know, the cancer stuff. It’s my left leg, mostly. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big. And it feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Heavy, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, like I’m carrying a brick around, almost. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? Honestly, time gets away from me these days. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay… "cancer stuff," right. Any formal diagnosis on record?
PATIENT: Um… breast cancer. A few years back now. I had… surgery, and then the… radiation. And pills. Lots of pills. I don’t really remember all the names, to be honest. They gave me so many. Is that okay? I don't mean to be… difficult.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's fine. It’s just… details are important. Pills… any you're still taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me think… Tamoxifen. That’s one. And… something for my blood pressure, I think? And a little white one for… cholesterol, maybe? I take them every morning with my coffee. Honestly, it’s a whole routine! I have a little pill box.
DOCTOR: Right, Tamoxifen… good. Blood pressure, cholesterol… okay. And this swelling, it’s just the left leg?
PATIENT: Yes, just the left one. It doesn’t go up very high, mostly around my calf and ankle. Sometimes my foot feels a bit… puffy too. I’ve been trying to put my feet up, but it doesn't seem to help much. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Let’s have a look. Hmm. Yes, there's definite edema. Calf is firm to the touch. Any redness or warmth?
PATIENT: Redness? No, not really. It feels… normal temperature, I think. It’s just… swollen. And heavy. Does… does this mean something bad? I’m sorry, I’m probably being silly.
DOCTOR: Look, we need to rule things out. This could be a number of things. Given your history, we need to consider… lymphatic drainage. And the Tamoxifen can sometimes contribute to these types of issues. Pulse is present, which is good. You're not being silly, it’s my job to figure this out. I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound, just to check for any blood clots. And we'll get some blood work done to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Doppler… ultrasound? Is that… painful? And blood work… ugh. Okay, if we have to. Will the blood work take long? I have an appointment with my hairdresser on Friday.
DOCTOR: No, the ultrasound isn’t painful. It just… scans your leg. And the blood work shouldn’t take too long, but the lab gets backed up. I'll put a rush on it, but honestly, I can't make any promises. Hairdressers are… a priority, I suppose. I'll have the nurse explain everything. And try to elevate your leg as much as possible in the meantime. Don’t push yourself.
PATIENT: Elevate… right. Okay. And… is there anything I should be looking for? Like, if it gets worse, or…? I don’t want to come running in here for nothing.
DOCTOR: If you notice any significant pain, redness, warmth, or if it suddenly gets much larger, go to the emergency room. Don't wait for me. Understand?
PATIENT: Right. Pain, redness, warmth… bigger. Got it. Okay. That’s… reassuring, I guess. Thank you. So… is that all? Can I… go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now. The nurse will get you set up with the lab orders and ultrasound appointment. Try not to worry. It’s probably nothing serious, but we’re being thorough. You can go now. Honestly, it's been a pleasure. .
PATIENT: Pleasure was all mine… .
