DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova, good to meet you. Though, frankly, at your age, everyone starts to blend together. So, let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a kind way of puttin' it, Doctor Memmolo. I appreciate the honesty! It's this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin' me for a little while now, on and off. Not the worst pain, but enough to make a fella a bit… distracted.
DOCTOR: Distracted, yes. Vague complaint. How long is "a little while," exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, I'd say about three weeks ago, maybe a little more. At first it was just now and then, after a long day workin' on someone's hands and feet, you know? But lately it's been almost every day. Not constant, mind you, comes and goes. But definitely more frequent than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what makes it worse?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a good question. Not sure if anything really makes it worse, specifically. Seems to happen no matter what I'm doin'. Though, bendin' over for a long time at work… that might make it a little sharper, I suppose. But honestly, it could be happenin' whether I’m standin', sittin', or lyin' down. It’s a bit… unpredictable, you see?
DOCTOR: Unpredictable. Wonderful. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Not really, no. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no fever or anything like that. I've been sleepin' alright, eatin' alright. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's just old age catchin' up with me, I reckon. My wife, bless her heart, says I'm always complainin' about somethin', but this headache is somethin' new.
DOCTOR: Sleep and appetite are… adequate, then. And you haven’t noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Adequate, yes, that’s a good word. And no, no changes in my vision at all. I can still see just fine, read my newspaper every mornin', watch my little TV programs in the evenin'. Everything looks clear as a bell. I even helped my grandson with his model airplane the other day, had to thread those tiny little pieces of string! Still got a steady hand, you see. Though, it's the back of my head that's the problem, not my eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications, hmm… Well, not much at all, really. Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands, keeps the joints from gettin' too stiff when I'm workin'. It's called… let me think… Naproxen, I believe. Just one a day, usually. And sometimes, if I'm really achin', I'll take an extra one. But that's it. I don't like takin' a lot of pills, if I can help it. Always worried about side effects, you know?
DOCTOR: Naproxen. Of course. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks before I take somethin' new, just to be safe. She's a worrier, that one, but a good woman. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, for colds, flus, little aches and pains… never a problem. So, no, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a quick look. Just need to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, if you don't mind, I'm going to palpate your head a bit. Don't worry, it won't hurt… much.
PATIENT: Sounds sensible to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. My blood pressure's usually alright, I think. Though I don't keep a close watch on it. Been workin' with my hands for sixty years now, keeps me active, you see. Palpate away, I'm not afraid of a little proddin'. Just let me know if you feel anything unusual, alright?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound… acceptable. Palpation reveals some tenderness in the occipital region. Not alarming, but present. Alright. It is tender back there. Could be muscle tension, could be something else. I'm going to order some blood work, just to rule things out. And I think an MRI would be a good idea, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh dear. Now, that sounds… serious. Is that somethin' you really think is necessary, Doctor? I mean, I'm just an old man with a headache, not fallin' apart at the seams! Blood work, I understand, but an MRI… is it really that important? And what does this all cost, if you don't mind me askin'? I don't have insurance, you see. It's just my wife and me on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Popova, it’s standard procedure to rule out anything serious. An elevated blood pressure and a headache could be nothing, but we don’t know that. The MRI is just to be safe. As for the cost… I’m aware you don’t have insurance. It will be expensive. I can give you the billing department’s number. They might have some payment options. I will write the orders for the blood work and the MRI. We need to get this done as soon as possible. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can figure out what’s going on.
PATIENT: Payment options… that doesn't sound very promising. My wife, she'll be most upset. We were hopin' to visit our grandson in Florida this winter… this could put a stop to that. Alright, Doctor. If you really think it's necessary, I suppose we have no choice. But please, tell me honestly… are you thinkin' it's somethin' bad? I don't want to worry my wife unnecessarily, you see. She's already had a difficult year. Just give it to me straight, alright? No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Popova, I'm not going to speculate. It’s likely nothing serious. But at your age, it's important to be thorough. The MRI will give us more information. Let’s just get the tests done, and then we can discuss the results. Here are the orders. The lab and imaging center information is on the papers. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, to discuss the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks… that seems like a long time to wait, if it is somethin' serious. No, I don't suppose I have any questions right now. Just… try not to worry my wife, alright? She's a sensitive soul. And thank you, Doctor, for… tryin'. I appreciate it. I suppose I'll go and arrange these tests… and try to find a way to pay for them. Thank you again. .
