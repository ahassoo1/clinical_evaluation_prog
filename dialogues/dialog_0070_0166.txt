DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It's mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little…off in the right one too.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Numbness can be concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it evaluated. “Persistent” is a helpful word – can you tell me roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this numbness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t constant at first, just… fleeting sensations. But over the last week or so, it's become more noticeable and happens more frequently. I can recall the exact date it began, actually – July 10th. I was walking home from the studio.
DOCTOR: July 10th, alright, that's helpful to know. And you mentioned it started while walking home from the studio. Could you describe what you were doing at the studio, and what the numbness felt like right after that walk?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a special effects artist and animator, so I spend most of my day at a computer, mostly sitting. That day specifically, I was working on a particularly complex motion capture sequence – a lot of fine adjustments and repetitive hand movements. Right after the walk home, the numbness… it wasn’t a complete loss of feeling, more like a pins-and-needles sensation in my foot and lower calf, on my left leg. It subsided relatively quickly then, but it's been…returning since.
DOCTOR: Okay, repetitive hand movements and a lot of time at the computer. That gives me some initial thoughts. And the pins-and-needles sensation is good to know. Does anything specific trigger the numbness now, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Prolonged sitting definitely makes it worse. If I’m sitting for too long without moving, it starts up again. Standing for a while doesn’t seem to affect it much, and walking usually helps to alleviate it, at least temporarily. I also recall noticing it's worse after I've been particularly focused on a difficult project - when I forget to take breaks. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like positional changes and concentration levels play a role. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you experienced any pain accompanying the numbness?
PATIENT: Not really. There’s no sharp pain, and it’s not a burning sensation. Occasionally, I get a dull ache in my thigh, but it’s infrequent and mild. It doesn’t feel like a typical muscle ache, though. More like… a general discomfort. I can recall the last time I felt it was the 28th of July – it was after a long day of rendering.
DOCTOR: Alright, so mild, infrequent ache, linked to exertion. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg, or any difficulty with walking or balance?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t experienced any weakness. I can walk normally, and my balance hasn’t been affected at all. I’m fairly active, I enjoy hiking when I have the time, and I haven’t noticed any issues with that. I recall doing a fairly strenuous hike just last weekend, and my leg felt perfectly normal afterwards.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s reassuring. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or a nerve disorder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I recall having a thorough physical before starting my apprenticeship three years ago, and everything was normal then. I don’t have any ongoing medical conditions, and I’m not currently taking any medications.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. I haven't. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I recall breaking my arm when I was a child – a rather clumsy fall from a tree – but that was just a simple fracture, treated with a cast. Nothing requiring anything more serious than that. I’ve always been fairly careful, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother has had some issues with arthritis in her hands, but nothing debilitating. My father is in excellent health, as far as I know. He’s a fisherman, very active. No history of diabetes or nerve disorders on either side of the family, to my recollection. I recall my grandmother on my mother's side having some mild back pain, but again, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I recall reading that a physical exam is a standard part of the diagnostic process, so I was expecting it. Please proceed at your convenience.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in both legs. Then, I’ll assess your sensation – that is, your ability to feel light touch, pain, and vibration. Finally, I'll do a brief neurological exam. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you please resist as I push down on your legs?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I understand. I will let you know if anything feels uncomfortable. I believe I can resist your pressure. I try to keep my legs as firm as possible. I recall doing similar exercises in physical therapy after a minor sports injury in high school.
DOCTOR: Good, strength appears normal as well. Now, let’s check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton swab. Please tell me when you feel it. We’ll start with your left leg. Can you tell me when you feel the touch?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. I feel it right there, and now here. It seems… normal. I can feel the pressure clearly throughout my leg. I recall being quite sensitive to touch, even as a child. It's still consistent now.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's move to your right leg. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that as well. Consistent sensation here too, Doctor. No difference between the two legs. I recall my grandfather often commenting on my good sense of touch, especially when carving wood. It seems to be holding up alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s reassuring. Now, I’m going to quickly check your gait – how you walk – just to see if there are any subtle differences. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds sensible. I recall watching various medical dramas where gait analysis is frequently employed. I'm happy to participate.
DOCTOR: Okay, walk normally for me, please. Your gait appears normal. No noticeable limping or abnormalities. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with peripheral nerve compression, possibly related to prolonged sitting and repetitive movements. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds prudent, Doctor. I appreciate your thorough assessment. Peripheral nerve compression… that aligns with what I suspected, given my work. Ordering some tests to confirm seems like a sensible next step. Yes, please proceed. I recall reading that imaging can be quite helpful in diagnosing such conditions. What sort of tests are you considering?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm considering two tests: a nerve conduction study and an electromyography, or EMG. The nerve conduction study will measure the speed of electrical signals traveling through your nerves, while the EMG will assess the electrical activity in your muscles. These tests can help pinpoint the location and severity of any nerve compression. I'll also order a basic blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions like diabetes. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds entirely acceptable. A nerve conduction study and EMG, along with the blood test… a comprehensive approach. I recall discussing such tests with a colleague who experienced similar symptoms, and they found them quite informative. I’m happy to proceed with all of those. When can I schedule these tests?
DOCTOR: Good. The lab can usually accommodate you within the week. How does Thursday afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Thursday afternoon works perfectly, Doctor. I recall having a relatively open schedule that day. Please proceed with scheduling the tests for Thursday afternoon. I trust your staff will contact me with the details?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, my staff will contact you shortly with the specific time and instructions for the tests. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged sitting as much as possible, taking frequent breaks to stretch and move around, and ensuring you have good ergonomic support at your workstation. We'll review the results once they're available and discuss a treatment plan, which may include physical therapy or other interventions. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That sounds entirely agreeable, Doctor. Avoiding prolonged sitting, frequent breaks, and ergonomic support… I can certainly implement those changes. I recall reading extensively about preventative measures for such conditions, and those recommendations align perfectly. I appreciate your comprehensive guidance. I look forward to hearing from your staff regarding the test scheduling. Thank you for your time and expertise today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. Have a good day.
