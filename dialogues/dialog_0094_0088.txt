DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Uh, it's this ringing in my ears. It's been… annoying, to say the least. Been happening for a couple weeks now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in your ears. That can certainly be disruptive. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. It's not constant, thankfully. Comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a high-pitched whine, other times it's more like… a buzzing. It's hard to explain. It’s just… there. And it makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good it’s not constant, but intermittent ringing can still be very bothersome. And difficulty concentrating is a common symptom. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think it started after a wedding, actually. My cousin’s wedding. There was a lot of music, pretty loud. We were right near the speakers for a bit. I thought maybe it was just from that, you know, being too close to the sound. I figured it'd go away. But it hasn't really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. So it began shortly after exposure to loud music at the wedding. That certainly makes sense as a potential cause. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse since then?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Quiet places, weirdly enough. Like, if I'm trying to relax at home, it seems louder. And stress… if I’m stressed about something, it gets worse too. Oh, and headphones. Using headphones makes it really bad. I usually listen to music on my commute. Now I try to avoid them.
DOCTOR: Alright, so quiet environments, stress, and headphone use all seem to exacerbate the ringing. That's a consistent pattern. Have you experienced any hearing loss alongside the ringing, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything sounds normal, I think. I can hear people talking fine, and the TV isn't too loud or anything. I haven't really tested it though, if that makes sense. I just assumed I could still hear okay.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It's helpful that you haven’t noticed any change in your hearing, but it’s also possible it’s a subtle loss we’d need to investigate. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was divorced a couple years ago, which was stressful, but… that's about it. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I have private insurance, so I usually get checkups when I need them. Just the usual stuff. And I don't take any regular medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history or medications. That simplifies things. And your divorce was a couple of years ago - I appreciate you sharing that; stress can certainly impact a lot of things. Now, regarding your family… is there any history of hearing loss or tinnitus in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. I don't really… talk about health stuff with my family much. My dad always said he had a bit of trouble hearing as he got older, but I just figured that was age. My mum… I don't think so. I don't remember anyone complaining about ringing, specifically. Sorry, I'm not very helpful with that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jaylyne. Family history can be tricky to recall. It sounds like there might be a predisposition, but it's not definitive. Let’s move onto your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Don’t really drink much, to be honest. And definitely no drugs. I work as a waiter, so I need a clear head. It’s a pretty busy place.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty boring, health-wise, I guess. Is this all taking a long time? I have another shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Not at all! You're not boring, and this is all very helpful information, Jaylyne. It’s important to get a good understanding of everything. And don't worry, we're almost done with the initial questioning. Okay, so no allergies, no significant medical history. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, just to make sure there isn’t any wax buildup or sign of infection. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I really need to get back to work. I hate leaving my coworkers short-handed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, externally your ears look normal. And… hmm. There’s a very small amount of cerumen in both ears, but nothing significant. Your ear canals are clear. Heart sounds are normal, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are normal, balance is good, and coordination is intact. Okay, physically, everything seems normal at this point. But given the duration and pattern of your symptoms, I think it would be prudent to order a simple audiogram – a hearing test – just to get a baseline assessment of your hearing levels and rule out any subtle hearing loss. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, a hearing test sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best. Where would I even go to get one of those? I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. I can give you a referral to a local audiologist – a specialist in hearing health. There are a couple of excellent practices nearby. I’ll print out the referral with their contact information and instructions. The test is painless and takes about half an hour. They will play tones through headphones at different frequencies and volumes, and you just indicate when you can hear them. While we wait for the results of the audiogram, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. Consider using earplugs in noisy environments, and definitely avoid using headphones for now. We can also discuss some stress management techniques if you think that might be helpful. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds… okay. Avoiding headphones is easy enough. And I guess I could try some stress stuff. It's just… work is stressful, you know? But I'll see what the test says first. So, you're going to print out that referral? How long does it usually take to get the results? I really don’t want to be off work for too long.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This is a referral to Coastal Audiology. They have appointments available next week. As for the results, typically they send them directly to me within a couple of business days. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a more definitive plan. I understand your concern about being off work. The audiogram itself doesn’t require any downtime. It’s a quick and straightforward test. We’ll work together to minimize any disruption to your schedule. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not making me feel like I’m crazy, even though this ringing is driving me nuts. I’ll call them tomorrow and get an appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. It's understandable that it’s frustrating, and you’re absolutely not crazy. Tinnitus can be very disruptive, and we’ll work to figure out what’s causing it and find a way to manage it. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good rest of your day, and try not to stress too much. .
