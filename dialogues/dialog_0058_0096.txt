DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, nice to meet you too, Doctor TodoroVICH. It’s… well, it’s my eyes, really. They've been really bothered by the sun lately. More than usual, I mean. Everything just feels so bright, even with sunglasses on. It's been happening for a few months now, but it's gotten worse this past month, especially.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Okay. “Sun bothered, worse past month.” Right. And you say even with sunglasses it's still too bright?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. I usually have a good pair, the kind that block a lot of light, you know? But it doesn’t seem to be enough anymore. It's not just like squinting – it actually hurts sometimes, like a sharp pain behind my eyes. It makes it hard to even be outside for very long.
DOCTOR: "Sharp pain behind the eyes…" Okay. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It's not always hurting, thankfully. But when I'm out in the sun, even for just a little bit, that’s when it really starts. It builds up, I guess. Like, the longer I'm in the light, the worse it gets. And it'll linger for a bit even after I get inside, you know? Maybe an hour or so. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Okay, so it's triggered by sun exposure, and it lasts for about an hour afterward. And you said it feels like a sharp pain behind your eyes… not in your eyes, correct?
PATIENT: That's right. Not in my eyes, no. It's… hard to explain. It's like a pressure, but a painful one, right at the back of my head, where my eyes are. It doesn't feel like something in the eyeball itself, if that makes sense. It’s not itchy or gritty or anything like that. Just… pain behind them.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no redness, no discharge, no blurry vision… just this pain behind the eyes when exposed to sunlight. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No redness, no blurry vision, no… discharge, like you said. Just the pain. Hmm… let me think. Actually, now that you mention it, I have been getting headaches more often lately. Just regular headaches, not anything super bad, but they've been popping up more, especially in the afternoons. I hadn’t really connected it to the eye thing, though.
DOCTOR: Headaches... afternoons... Okay. And are these headaches on both sides of your head, or just one side?
PATIENT: Usually both sides, actually. It's not, like, a throbbing pain, more of a dull ache, you know? It'll start at the back of my head and kind of spread out from there. And, like I said, it’s worse in the afternoons. I usually just take some paracetamol and it goes away, but it's happening more and more often now. I used to hardly get headaches at all.
DOCTOR: Right. So, dull ache, both sides, afternoons, relieved with paracetamol. Okay. Have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes in my vision that I’ve noticed. Everything seems pretty clear, as far as I can tell. I can read just fine, drive just fine… I haven't noticed anything blurry or double vision or anything like that. It’s just the pain when I’m in the sun, and the headaches lately. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? I'm starting to get a little worried.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Komarov, it's good you're getting it checked out. We need to rule a few things out. I'm going to do a quick exam of your eyes, and then I'll check your blood pressure. We'll see what we find. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't think so. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I usually just tough things out. But… well, I lost my wife a little over a year ago, and things haven’t been the same. Maybe that’s why I haven’t been taking care of myself as well as I should. But no, I've never been told I have high blood pressure. Is that something that could be causing this?
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, while I sympathize with your loss, we need to focus on your current symptoms. I'm not going to speculate on causes without a proper examination. Let's just get through the exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Sorry, I didn't mean to… I just… I get worried. Please, go ahead with the exam. Whatever you think is best. I'll just… try to be quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat and face forward. I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes and check your pupils, then I'll check your eye movements. Try to follow my pen with your eyes, don't strain. Okay, look straight ahead... Now, follow my pen... Left... Right... Up... Down... Good. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision... Can you see my fingers when I hold them up in your side vision?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see them, Doctor. On both sides, I think. They’re a little blurry around the edges, but I can see them. It’s a little difficult with the bright light, though. It kind of makes me squint. Is that normal? I’m trying my best to follow the pen, but it's hard when I'm blinking so much.
DOCTOR: Peripheral vision seems intact, though as you said, you’re squinting. It's making it difficult to get a clear reading. Squinting can sometimes indicate eye strain. Now, let’s check your eye pressure. This will feel like a puff of air on your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it might be a little uncomfortable. Please, keep your chin down and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, chin down, looking ahead… blinks Oh! That was… surprising. It didn’t hurt, but it definitely made me jump. Is everything okay? That felt a little… stronger than I expected. Did you get a good reading? I’m a little worried now, Doctor. I really don’t like having things puffed at my eyes.
DOCTOR: The readings are slightly elevated, Mr. Komarov. Not drastically, but enough to warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms – the pain behind the eyes, the headaches, the sensitivity to light, and now the slightly elevated eye pressure – I'm going to order a visual field test and an OCT scan. These will give us a better picture of what's going on with your optic nerve and retina. It's likely just eye strain, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any family history of glaucoma or other eye conditions?
PATIENT: Glaucoma…? Oh, um… I don't think so, actually. My mother had cataracts when she got older, but that’s about it. My father… he died when I was young. I don’t really know much about his health. Nobody really talked about it. We didn’t have much money, so we didn’t go to the doctor often. What does this all mean, Doctor? Are you saying it could be something serious? I'm starting to get really scared now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, please try to remain calm. I'm not saying it is serious, but it’s important to be thorough. Elevated eye pressure can be a sign of glaucoma, which, if left untreated, can lead to vision loss. However, it can also be caused by other things. The tests will help us determine the cause. I'm going to refer you to an ophthalmologist for these tests. They’re the specialists in eye care. I’ll send the referral through to Dr. Anya Sharma. She's very good. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven't taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just paracetamol for headaches, like I said. Is Dr. Sharma in this building? Will I see her today? I really don’t like the thought of going to another doctor, especially after all of this. I just want to know what's wrong and get it fixed. I'm starting to feel very anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, Dr. Sharma is not in this building. She has her own practice. I'm referring you to her for specialist evaluation. You’ll need to call her office to schedule an appointment. Here’s the referral form with her contact information. I also want you to continue taking paracetamol as needed for your headaches. I've documented everything we discussed today in your chart. I'm not going to speculate further until Dr. Sharma completes her evaluation. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. And I hope Dr. Sharma can see me soon. It's just… all of this is a bit overwhelming. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I’ll call Dr. Sharma’s office right away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any urgent concerns before your appointment with Dr. Sharma. .
