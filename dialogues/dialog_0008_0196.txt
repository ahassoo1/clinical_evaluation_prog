DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really have the energy for much anymore. It’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, it’s hard to say exactly how long. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “always tired.” And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, a rough estimate… Let me think. My husband… he passed away three years ago. It feels like it started getting really bad around then, maybe? Or maybe a little before? It’s all just… mixed up. I really don't know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is, thank you. Grief can certainly take a toll on your energy levels. We'll definitely consider that. But let's try to pinpoint what this tiredness feels like. Is it a constant feeling, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. Like a weight. Not like I did something to make myself tired, just… always there. Some days are worse than others, of course. But even on the “good” days, I’m not really energetic, you know? More just… less drained. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. “Constant fatigue, with fluctuations in severity.” Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I get headaches sometimes. Not awful, but… frequent. And my muscles ache a bit. Like I’ve been doing too much, even when I haven’t. And… I feel a bit foggy, like I said before. Trouble remembering things.
DOCTOR: Headaches, muscle aches, and some cognitive fog… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don't feel hungry at all, and other days I eat a bit more. I don't really keep track. As for weight… I think I've lost a little bit? It’s hard to say for sure. I don't weigh myself often. Everything feels… unimportant lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you having any trouble sleeping, or are you sleeping too much?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I wake up a lot during the night. I don’t… I don’t sleep well. I’m not sure if I’m sleeping enough, or if it's just… not restful. I wouldn’t say I sleep too much, though. Maybe six hours a night? Sometimes less.
DOCTOR: Alright, six hours of interrupted sleep. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Oh, dear. Well, it’s… a little irregular, I suppose. Nothing terrible, but not… normal. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, like I said, but I haven’t really been paying attention. Honestly, Doctor, I just feel… worn out. It's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. Okay, just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you have any history of medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical problems… My blood pressure was a little high, I think, a few years ago. The doctor put me on something for it, but I can’t remember what it was called. And my mother had… arthritis, I think. Nothing else comes to mind, really. I didn’t go to the doctor much when my husband was alive. He handled all of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of slightly elevated blood pressure, mother with arthritis. And are you currently taking any medications, other than whatever you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh, medications… Let me think. I take something for my… aches and pains. Over-the-counter, you know? Ibuprofen, I think. And sometimes a little something to help me sleep. But that's it, I think. Oh, and vitamins. A multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for aches and pains, something for sleep occasionally, and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had any problems with allergies. I eat everything, pretty much. I’m not a picky eater.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Good. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. After that, I'll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. 140 over 85. A little elevated. Now, pulse is 78 and regular.
PATIENT: Alright. That’s… not good, is it? I haven’t checked my blood pressure in ages. Just do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly stronger than I’d like. No murmurs detected. Ears appear normal. No signs of infection. Throat is clear, slightly red but no obvious inflammation. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. No masses or organomegaly detected. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and your abdomen is tender. I’d like to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. Also, let’s get a urine sample to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Bloodwork and a urine sample. That’s a lot, isn’t it? But if it will help… then yes, let’s do it. Where do I go for those?
DOCTOR: Here's a requisition form for the lab. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They'll draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’d recommend trying to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night, even if you have to take a short nap during the day. Also, try to eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Seven to eight hours… that sounds… impossible. But I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I hear about the results? A few days, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, a few days. Usually three to five business days. The lab will call you directly with the results, and my office will schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available. If you don’t hear anything within five days, please give my office a call. Here’s a number to reach us: 555-1212. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: 555-1212. Okay. No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Cumper. I appreciate you listening. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. I understand. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
