DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get this over with. It’s my hand. It shakes. Been happening for… well, a while now. Honestly, it’s a nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand you're here about a tremor in your hand, and that it’s been ongoing for some time. I apologize for any wait, and I assure you I'll do my best to be efficient. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? It shakes! Like an old leaf in the wind. Happens when I try to do things, mostly. Writing… eating… even just holding a glass. It's embarrassing, is what it is. I used to have a steady hand, you know. Directed some very important pictures. Not like these shaky things nowadays. Honestly, the quality of everything has gone down… but never mind. What do you want to know, exactly?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Baide. It sounds frustrating, especially given your history of precise work. Let’s try to pinpoint some details. When did you first notice the shaking?
PATIENT: Pinpoint? Oh, jeez. That was… a long time ago. I don’t rightly remember. Maybe… five, ten years? It started small, barely noticeable. I thought it was just getting old. You know, wear and tear. But it’s gotten worse, that’s for sure. I’m not good with dates, never was. Ask me about a good camera angle, then I can tell you something. Is this going to take long? My lunch is at one.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with recalling the exact timing, Mr. Baide. “Five to ten years” gives us a good starting point. And I’ll certainly try to be mindful of your lunch appointment. Has anything specific seemed to trigger the shaking, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like what? Loud noises? I don’t know. It just happens. Maybe when I'm tired. Or stressed. Though, what isn’t stressful these days? The world is going to pot, that's what. But no, I don't think anything specific... I just try not to think about it. Makes it worse when I do think about it. Honestly, it’s probably just old age catching up with me. My wife always said I worked too hard… she was probably right. Now, can we speed this up? I really need to eat.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and desire to keep things moving, Mr. Baide. And I appreciate you sharing that it seems to be worse with tiredness or stress. Now, aside from making it difficult to write or eat, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I'm not sick, just… shaky! No fever, no cough, nothing like that. Maybe a little… stiff sometimes? In my fingers, mostly. But that could just be arthritis, my mother had that. Look, I’m a simple man, Doc. I just want this hand to stop shaking so I can enjoy my pasta! Is that too much to ask? Now, if you’ll excuse me... I’m starting to get hungry thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds like the stiffness is primarily in your fingers. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any weakness in your hand or arm?
PATIENT: Weakness? Not… exactly. It's not like I can't lift things. It just… tires easier, maybe? Holding a glass of water for too long gets a bit much. It's hard to explain. Look, I used to be able to hold a camera steady for hours. These days, I get winded just thinking about it. Honestly, I don't see what good all these questions are doing. Are you going to give me a pill or what? My wife always said doctors just talk and talk... she wasn't wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It sounds like the fatigue sets in with prolonged use. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It will only take a few minutes, and can help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, an exam? Really? Fine, get it over with. But don’t poke and prod too much. I don’t like being touched. And be quick about it. I’m warning you. This had better be worth my time. I have a very important afternoon nap scheduled. Honestly, I used to direct people for a living, and they were the ones getting examined. This is ridiculous. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Okay, and now if you could squeeze my hands as tightly as you can… Alright. Thank you, Mr. Baide. That didn't take long. I'm noting mild tremor, slightly diminished reflexes, and reduced grip strength. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, and often worsens with age and stress. However, to confirm this, and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a few simple blood tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Essential… what now? Tremor? I figured as much. Honestly, I suspected it was just old age. Look, blood tests? Do I have to? I hate needles. And frankly, I don't see what a blood test is going to prove. I shake, everyone knows I shake. Is this going to involve a lot of waiting? I don't have all day, you know. My wife used to handle all these things. She always said doctors just order tests… she was right again. Fine, do your tests, but make it quick. And don’t poke around too much. Just get it over with. I’m starving. Is there a nice Italian place around here?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Baide. The blood tests will help us rule out other potential causes for the tremor, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. It's just a precaution to ensure we have a clear understanding of what’s going on. It’s a standard panel, and should be relatively quick. I’ll order the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they usually don't have a long wait. While we wait for the results, we can discuss some potential treatment options for essential tremor, such as medication or physical therapy. As for a good Italian restaurant, there's "Bella Notte" just a few blocks away. I’ve heard good things about their pasta. Would you like me to have my nurse draw the blood for you now, or would you prefer to go to the lab yourself?
PATIENT: Look, just get the nurse to do it. I don't want to walk anywhere. I’m tired already. And frankly, I don't want to hear about “treatment options” right now. If there’s a pill that will make this shaking stop, fine, give me the pill. If not, just tell me I’m old and leave me alone. Honestly, I used to direct entire casts of thousands. This is getting ridiculous. Just… hurry. And tell your nurse to be gentle. This arm is sensitive. I’m starting to get a headache. Now, if you'll excuse me... I need to sit down. And can we just skip the small talk? I really don’t have the patience for it today. Is there any coffee around here? Strong coffee.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I understand your frustration and will keep things as brief and efficient as possible. I’ll also ask the nurse to bring you a cup of strong coffee while she draws the blood. Nurse Davies, could you please assist Mr. Baide with a blood draw?
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Just get it over with. And make sure she knows about the coffee. I need caffeine, stat. Honestly, the whole medical system is so inefficient. My wife used to say… well, never mind. Just do your job and let me get back to my life. I’m starting to feel faint. And tell her to be very gentle. This is important. I have a very important afternoon planned. A nap, as a matter of fact. Is it too much to ask for a little respect around here? Honestly… just hurry. And where is that coffee?
DOCTOR: Nurse Davies: "Good morning, Mr. Baide. Dr. Alanes has asked me to draw a few vials of blood. It will just take a few minutes. Dr. Alanes also requested I bring you a cup of strong coffee to help you feel more comfortable. It's right here." Nurse Davies: "I've been informed you’d like a gentle touch, and I assure you I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. Just relax your arm, and we’ll get this done quickly." Nurse Davies: "Alright, all done, Mr. Baide. Just keep pressure on this for a few minutes, and you should be all set. If you feel any dizziness or discomfort, please let me know immediately." Dr. Alanes: "Alright, Mr. Baide. That's it for now. The results should be back within a few hours, and my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and I hope you enjoy your nap."
