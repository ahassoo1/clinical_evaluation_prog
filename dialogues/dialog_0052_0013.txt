DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I just… I have trouble getting it all out, you see? Like it won’t empty completely. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a couple weeks. It's not painful, just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. So, you’re experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder, and this has been ongoing for approximately two weeks. You mentioned it’s not painful, just bothersome. To help me understand a little better, could you describe what you mean by “trouble getting it all out”?
PATIENT: Well, I go to the bathroom, and it starts normal, you know? But then… it just kinda stops. Like there's still some left in there, but I can’t push it out. I have to… wait a minute, then try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And I find myself going back to the bathroom pretty often, trying to get the rest. It’s just… inconvenient, mostly. And I worry a little about it, you know? Not knowing what it is.
DOCTOR: I see. So it starts normally, but then you experience a sensation of incomplete emptying, requiring you to wait and try again, often leading to frequent trips to the bathroom. That is certainly frustrating, and your concern is valid, Mr. Hilber. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me how much fluid you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I don’t really keep track, Doctor. I drink… coffee in the mornings, maybe three or four cups. And water throughout the day… probably a couple of big glasses, if that. And sometimes juice with dinner. I don’t drink a ton, I don’t think. Not like some folks I know. I try not to drink too much before bed, that’s for sure. It’s hard to say exactly, though. I just drink when I'm thirsty.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly three to four cups of coffee, a couple of glasses of water, and some juice with dinner, generally drinking when thirsty. That gives me a good starting point. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this difficulty emptying your bladder?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have been getting up a couple of times at night to go to the bathroom. Not every night, but more often than I used to. And, now that you mention it, I feel like I'm a little more thirsty than usual, even when I drink water. And I guess… maybe a little tired, too. But I'm an older fella, so that could be anything, right? I just figured it was part of getting old. It's hard to say what's connected to what, you know?
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Hilber, it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly what’s connected to what. However, the increased nighttime urination, increased thirst, and fatigue are all potentially relevant pieces of the puzzle. We need to consider all possibilities. To help me rule things out and get a clearer understanding, could you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. I had a bit of a heart problem a long time ago, maybe fifteen years back. They put a little… a stent in, I think they called it. And I have some arthritis, mostly in my knees. It bothers me some days more than others. And… oh, and my wife… she passed away a few years back, and the doctor said the grief could cause some problems with blood pressure, so I was on some medicine for that for a while, but I think I'm off it now. I can’t remember exactly. It was a lot to keep track of, after she was gone. I have Medicare, if that helps. They keep records, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Hilber. It's helpful to know about the history of heart issues with the stent placement, the arthritis, and the past blood pressure concerns. It's understandable that it was a lot to manage after your loss; we can certainly review your medication history through Medicare. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides the stent placement?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… No, I don’t believe so. Just the stent. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was a long time ago, when I was still living out on the islands. Everything else… just the usual bumps and bruises, nothing major. I try to avoid doctors if I can, you know? They always want to poke and prod at you. But this… this is bothering me enough that I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It's good that you came in to address this, and we will proceed at a pace you're comfortable with. So, to clarify, no surgeries besides the stent and your appendix as a young man. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. It's an anti-inflammatory, I think. Ibuprofen, maybe? The little white pills. And sometimes I take a fish oil pill, for my heart. My daughter told me to. She's a nurse, you know. Other than that… no. Not really. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it. They never seem to do much good, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so ibuprofen as needed for your knees, and fish oil supplements. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife used to make all sorts of dishes, out on the islands, with all sorts of things. I never had a problem. I haven't taken anything new in a long time, so I can’t imagine I'm allergic to anything. But if you need to give me a shot or something, you might want to be careful, just in case. I guess you can never be too safe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Hilber. No known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family experienced problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Let me think… That’s a tough one. My mother… she had some trouble with her legs, swelling, I think. But I don’t know if that’s related. And my father… he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. He died young, in an accident. We didn't talk much about health, back then. It wasn’t something we focused on. I don’t recall anyone having trouble with their bladder or kidneys, no. Most of my family is gone now, anyway. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. Family history can be difficult to recall, especially with time. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, huh? Well, I live alone in a small house, just outside of town. I used to fish a lot, out on the river, but my knees aren't what they used to be, so I don't get out as much anymore. I read a lot, mostly history books. And I watch some television. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. And I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feeling fancy. I try to stay active, but it’s hard, you know? Getting older is… challenging.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. That gives me a good picture of your lifestyle. Alright, now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a brief neurological exam. We'll also need to do a urine test to check for infection or other abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, if you would. And let me know what you’re doing, so I don’t get surprised. I’m an old man, easily startled, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I will explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This helps me assess your bladder and other organs. Normal sounds heard. No bruits or murmurs. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical. Now, I'm going to briefly assess your neurological function. Sensation intact to light touch bilaterally. Strength 5/5 in lower extremities. Now, could you please provide me with a urine sample?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here you go. It might be a little weak, I just went before I came in. I try to stay hydrated, you know? But I’ll try my best. Just let me know if you need more. I used to be able to hold it for hours, out on the islands. Now, not so much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. This is perfect. I will send this sample to the lab for analysis. Now, I will perform a quick digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. This will help me determine if there is any enlargement or tenderness that could be contributing to your symptoms. The prostate feels mildly enlarged, but there is no significant tenderness. This is common for men your age. I don't feel any concerning nodules. We will await the results of the urine test to rule out infection. Based on your history and physical exam, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in older men, where the prostate gland enlarges, causing difficulty with urination.
PATIENT: BPH, you say? Is that… serious, Doctor? Will I need surgery? I don’t want any surgery, if I can avoid it. I’ve heard stories… bad stories.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Hilber. BPH is not inherently serious, but it can significantly impact your quality of life. It's very common, affecting many men as they age. And no, surgery isn't always necessary. In many cases, we can manage the symptoms with lifestyle changes and medication. The urine test will help us rule out other possible causes, like infection, and confirm that's what we're dealing with. If the test comes back clear, we can discuss some options. We could start with things like reducing fluid intake before bed, timed voiding – going to the bathroom on a schedule – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. If those aren’t enough, there are medications available that can help shrink the prostate or relax the muscles in your bladder. Surgery is generally reserved for more severe cases that don’t respond to other treatments. We will only consider surgery if it is absolutely necessary and after thoroughly discussing all other options with you. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. Lifestyle changes, I can do that. I don’t mind cutting back on coffee, and I suppose I can avoid alcohol. And medication… well, that’s better than surgery, for sure. How long will it take to get the results back, Doctor? And what should I do if things get worse before then? I don’t want to be stuck, unable to go, you know? That would be… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mr. Hilber. We'll start with the least invasive options first. The urine test results typically take 24-48 hours. I will have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. If your symptoms worsen before then – if you experience a complete inability to urinate, severe pain, fever, chills, or blood in your urine – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those symptoms could indicate a more serious problem that requires prompt attention. Otherwise, continue to monitor your symptoms and keep track of how much fluid you’re drinking. We can discuss a voiding diary to get a better understanding of your bladder habits during your follow-up appointment. I’ll schedule that for next week, once we have the lab results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to know it’s not necessarily serious, and that there are options. I’ll try my best to follow your advice, and I’ll keep track of how much I’m drinking. Thank you again, Doctor Shely. And thank you to the nurse as well, for scheduling the appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber. And remember, we’re here to help.
PATIENT: .
