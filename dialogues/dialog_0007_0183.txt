DOCTOR: Hi Chirag, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Hernandez. Yes. Good to meet you too, I suppose. It's… this tiredness. Always tired. Even when I sleep. It’s been… a while now. Not good. My wife says I need to come. She's always right, you know. But tiredness. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness. I understand. And it sounds frustrating to be dealing with that for a while now, especially when sleep doesn't help. Your wife sounds like a good advocate for your health – it’s always good to listen to them. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? I am tired. All the time. Like… heavy. Like someone put weights on my arms and legs. Even thinking is hard sometimes. Before, I could work all day, no problem. Now? I need naps. Bad naps. And still tired. It’s… annoying. Very annoying. You understand annoying, yes?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand annoying, Chirag. It sounds incredibly disruptive. Okay, so it’s a heavy fatigue, affecting your energy levels and your ability to concentrate, and it’s a change from how you used to feel. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… after I got sick. A long time ago. Maybe… six months? No, longer. Maybe eight? I had… problems with my liver, the doctor said. Still do, I think. They give me pills. Not helping much with the tired. It came slowly, the tiredness. Not one day, boom, tired. Slowly. Like… a slow leak. You know what a slow leak is? Like a tire. Losing air. Very slow.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand a slow leak. That’s a helpful way to describe it. So, about eight months ago, around the time of your liver issues, you started feeling increasingly tired. You’re currently taking medication for your liver – can you tell me what that medication is, and how often you take it?
PATIENT: Pills… so many pills. Let me see… my wife handles all that. She keeps the list. Um… there’s… one is yellow. Small yellow pill. Take that one… twice a day. And a white one. Bigger. That one is once a day. And… something else, maybe? I don’t remember. She says I need to take them. I do. Mostly. It’s all… very complicated. She says not to miss them. They help the liver, she says. But not the tired. Still tired. Do you need the names? She has a list. I don’t bother with names. Too many names.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly okay, Chirag. We can definitely get the list from your wife – that's often the easiest way. Knowing what you’re taking is more important than memorizing the names right now. Since your tiredness started around the time of your liver issues, and you’re currently on medication for it, we'll want to explore that connection. Do you see a specialist for your liver?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor… Patel. Very young doctor. Seems smart, I guess. I go… every few months. He checks things. Runs tests. Pokes and prods. Tells me to take the pills. Says my liver is… not good. He looks at the numbers. Lots of numbers. I don’t understand the numbers. He says they need to be better. Then I take more pills. It’s always pills. He is… okay. Doesn’t say much. Very serious. Not like my old doctor. He was… friendly. This one just looks at numbers. And gives me pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Patel. And he focuses on the liver numbers. It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected from the process, which I understand. We’ll try to get a copy of those numbers from his office to get a clearer picture. Now, outside of your liver issues and the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel… heavy. That's a symptom, yes? Everything hurts a little. My stomach, sometimes. Feels… full. Even when I haven't eaten much. And… I don't have much… appetite. Food doesn’t taste good anymore. Just… bland. Like cardboard. My wife makes nice food. I don't want it. She gets upset. It’s… a problem. Everything is a problem these days. Do you understand problems? Lots of problems.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand problems, Chirag. It sounds like you’re dealing with quite a lot. So, along with the tiredness and feeling heavy, you’re also experiencing some stomach discomfort, fullness even with little food, and a loss of appetite and taste. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? You mean… going to the toilet? Yes. It's… different now. Before, regular. Now? Sometimes… too much. Sometimes… not enough. It’s… unpredictable. And… the color is… strange. Not like it used to be. Darker. I don’t like it. My wife says I should tell the doctor. I didn’t want to bother him with… that. It’s embarrassing, you know? Talking about… that. Is that important? Is it the liver? Everything is the liver, I think.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Chirag. It’s important to tell me. Changes in bowel habits and color are important, and it’s good you’re bringing it up. Those could be related to your liver, or something else entirely. We need to investigate. And I completely understand it being embarrassing to talk about – that’s perfectly normal. I'm here to help, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, my ankles feel… tight. Especially at the end of the day. My wife… she notices more than me. She says they look puffy. She rubs them. Says it helps. I don’t really pay attention. It’s just… my ankles. I sit a lot, you know? Work is… sitting. Not much moving. Maybe that’s it. Just sitting. Do you think it's the sitting? It's always something, isn't it? Always a problem.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Chirag. Swelling, especially in the ankles, can be related to a few different things, and it’s good your wife has noticed it. It could be related to the sitting, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Finally, have you experienced any fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. No fever. Not that I know of. Chills? Sometimes I feel a little cold, but that's just the air conditioning. My wife likes it cold. Weight loss? Maybe… my clothes feel a little loose. But I haven't been eating much, so… that makes sense, yes? I haven't been trying to lose weight. Just… not hungry. Everything is tasteless. Like cardboard. It's all very… annoying. You understand annoying, yes? This whole thing is very, very annoying. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Chirag. And yes, I do understand annoying. It sounds incredibly frustrating to be dealing with all of this. Okay, so no fever or chills, and some unintentional weight loss likely due to loss of appetite. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your ankles for swelling. It will just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… don’t poke too much. My stomach is… sensitive. And… be gentle with the ankles. My wife gets upset if I complain. She says I need to be patient. She is always right, you know. Just… be gentle. And quick, if possible. I don’t like being poked and prodded. It reminds me of the other doctor. Not a friendly doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chirag. I'll be as gentle as possible. We’ll take our time, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Alright, your abdomen is a little tender in the upper right quadrant, and I do notice some mild swelling in both ankles. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I want to order some blood tests. We’ll check your liver function again, your complete blood count, and some other markers to get a better picture of what’s going on. I'm also going to order a stool test to look for any abnormalities. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Of course. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to feel better. My wife will be glad you’re doing tests. She says I need to be proactive. She is always right, you know. Blood… stool… Fine. Just… tell me where to go. And how long it will take. I have things to do. Not many, but… things. And… will it be painful? I don’t like needles. And… I don’t want to think about the stool test. Very embarrassing. Just… tell me where to go. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Chirig. It sounds unpleasant, and I’ll make it as quick and easy as possible. Here’s a requisition form. You’ll need to go to the lab downstairs, room 102. The blood draw shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. The stool test kit is also included – it comes with instructions, and you'll just need to collect a small sample at home. It’s not painful, thankfully. The lab technician will explain everything. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Downstairs. Room 102. A few days. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. My wife will want to know the results immediately. She is very… anxious. She is always right, you know. Fine. I'll go. Just… try to hurry things up, if possible. I have things to do. Not many, but… things. And… thank you. I think. For the tests. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Chirag, that's not too much to ask at all. We'll do everything we can to get you feeling normal again as quickly as possible. We’ll get these tests processed quickly. Here’s my card. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out together. You can head downstairs whenever you're ready. Have a good afternoon. .
