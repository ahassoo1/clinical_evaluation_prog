DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hey, good to meet you too, Dr. Amussen. Well, I just… kinda wanted to check things out. Been feelin’ okay, mostly. Just thought it was a good idea to see how I’m doin’, you know? Regular check-up kinda thing. I ain't really got nothin’ wrong, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s smart, Demondre – preventative care is always a good idea. Even when you're feeling well. Okay, so you're generally feeling okay… just a general check-up. Let’s get some details just to have a baseline. Have you had a check-up recently, or is this been a while?
PATIENT: Hmm… it has been a while, actually. Last one… maybe a couple years ago? When I was still workin’ on that other boat. Before… everything. I don't really remember much about it, to be honest. It was just… a check-up. They poked and prodded, said I was alright, and that was that. Don’t think I’ve been back since.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of years. Alright, that's good to know. We'll do a pretty thorough one today then. Just to get a good picture of where things are at. Do you have any specific concerns at all, even if they seem small?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Like I said, feelin’ pretty good. Sometimes my back gets a little sore after a long shift on the boat, but that’s kinda expected, right? Heavy work and all. It usually just works itself out with some rest. Nothing I worry about. I'm just… curious, I guess. Want to make sure everything's tickin’ like it should.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back soreness with work, that's understandable. We can definitely take a look at that. Just to rule anything else out. Let's go through some general questions then, if you don’t mind. It’ll help me get a good overview. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ outta a tree. But that healed up fine. And I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox and all that. But nothin’ major. No surgeries, no serious sicknesses. Just the broken arm a long time ago. I think that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, childhood illnesses. Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Well, my mom’s still around, she's doin’ okay. She’s got a little bit of… I think it’s high blood pressure, but she goes to the doctor regular. My dad… he passed away a few years back. He worked on the boats too, for a long time. He had some problems with his lungs, towards the end. I think it was from all the… stuff he breathed in over the years. Not sure exactly what it was. It was a long time ago. Mostly, that's it. I don't really talk to the rest of my family much.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with high blood pressure, father with lung problems… I’m sorry to hear about your dad. That's good information to have. And how about you – do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to nothin’. I don’t take any medicine regular, either. Just… whatever I need if I get a cold, you know? Over-the-counter stuff. Never been to the hospital for an allergy or nothin’. I think I’m pretty lucky in that department.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been much of a smoker. Tried it once or twice when I was younger, didn’t like it. And I don’t drink much, maybe a beer every now and then with friends, but not regular. Definitely no drugs. I like keepin’ myself clear-headed for work, you know? Gotta be sharp on the boat.
DOCTOR: That's good. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs. Alright. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me a little about what your work is like?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m a sailor and a marine oiler. Basically, I work on cargo ships, keepin’ everything runnin’ smooth. I do a lot of heavy liftin’, checkin’ the engines, makin’ sure all the oil levels are good, stuff like that. It's hard work, long hours, but… I like it. It keeps me busy, and I get to see different places. Mostly, it's just a lot of physical work and bein’ on my feet all day. Sometimes we're at sea for weeks at a time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Long hours, heavy lifting, time at sea. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam then, just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need. I ain’t got nothin’ to hide.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up here for me. First, I’m going to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Okay, blood pressure is 128/80, pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6, and respiration is 16. All within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. Nose is clear. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Everything seems normal so far. Just to get a complete picture, I think it would be good to order some routine blood work – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. That'll give us a good baseline to work with. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Wow, okay. Sounds… good, I guess. Everything is normal? That’s good to hear. Blood work sounds fine. I don't really know much about all that stuff, but if you think it's a good idea, I trust you. And no, I don't think I got any questions right now. Just… what does all that mean? Like, what are you lookin' for with the blood work? Just so I know what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Of course. The blood work is just to get a more detailed picture of your overall health. The complete blood count will check your red and white blood cell counts, which can tell us about your immune function and if you have any signs of infection or anemia. The basic metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. It’s just a routine screening to make sure everything is functioning properly. Because you work a physically demanding job and spend time at sea, it's good to have a baseline to compare to in the future, and to rule out any potential issues. It doesn't mean anything is necessarily wrong, it’s just preventative. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and I’ll give you a call to discuss them. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes a lot more sense. Preventative, right? Good idea. Checkin’ things out before somethin’ goes wrong. I like that. So, a few days, and you’ll call. Okay. Is there anything I need to do before the blood work? Like, fast or anything? I don't wanna mess it up.
DOCTOR: Good question. Yes, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. Just water. We'll send the order electronically to the lab, and they will remind you of the fasting requirement when they schedule the appointment. I’ll also write it on a paper for you to take home, just in case. Here you go. It’s also a good idea to stay hydrated before the draw – drink plenty of water the day before. Any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Okay, 12 hours, just water. Got it. That's not too bad. I can handle that. And… no, I think that’s everything. You explained everything really well, Dr. Amussen. I appreciate it. I was kinda nervous comin’ in, but you made it a lot easier.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Demondre. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your blood draw. We’ll be in touch in a few days with the results. Have a good day, and stay safe out there.
