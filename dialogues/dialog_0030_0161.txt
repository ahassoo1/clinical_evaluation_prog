DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I come talk about… preventative things. About staying healthy. She mentioned something about a pill you can take, before anything even happens. I don't even really know what it's called, to be honest. I just want to be careful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. That's very wise of you to be proactive about your health. It sounds like your friend may be referring to medications for osteoporosis prevention, or perhaps some screening tests to assess your risk. We can definitely discuss both options. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? No, I don’t think so. My friend specifically said it was a pill. She said it protects you from… well, from getting sick. From something you get from… being with someone. Look, I'm 55. I've lived a life, you know? I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to stay safe, especially now. As for medical history… hmm. I have high blood pressure, controlled with medication. Had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Otherwise… pretty healthy, I think. Medicare keeps me on top of things with yearly checkups. Is that enough? I’m not very good at remembering dates and names of things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. It sounds like your friend may have been referring to PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis – a medication to prevent HIV transmission. It's a very reasonable concern to have, and a good thing to discuss. Thank you for sharing your medical history. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal ten years ago. That's helpful. And it's good to know Medicare keeps you up to date with checkups. Just to clarify, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! PrEP… that's what she said. Yes, that's it! It’s good to finally have a name for it. And yes, I am. Not… regularly, but I do have a partner. A new partner. He's a lovely man, but… well, you know. It’s best to be careful, isn’t it? I haven't really been with anyone seriously in years, and… things change. It's good to be on the safe side, especially with everything going around these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. It is always best to be on the safe side, and it’s very responsible of you to consider PrEP. To determine if PrEP is right for you, we'll need to do a bit more assessment. Firstly, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had the usual childhood things, but no serious allergies. I can take most antibiotics without a problem, and I’ve never had a reaction to any of the blood pressure medication I’m on now. I can't recall ever having to go to the hospital for an allergic reaction, if that helps. Is this going to be a long process? I have a parking shift later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Helaina. No known allergies is helpful. It won't be a long process, thankfully. To start PrEP, we need to run some blood tests to check your kidney function, screen for any existing HIV infection , and test for hepatitis B. We also need to discuss your sexual health practices in more detail, and I’ll do a physical exam. It shouldn't take more than an hour or so. Before we proceed, could you tell me which medications you are currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Okay, good. An hour, that's manageable. Let me think… it’s Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes, if my pressure gets really high, my doctor prescribes HCTZ, a water pill, but I haven’t taken that in a few months. I have both bottles at home if you need the exact dosage. I mostly just take the Lisinopril now. Is that enough information? I really don't like being a bother.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily, and occasional HCTZ – that’s very helpful, Helaina. You’re not a bother at all; it’s my job to gather this information to ensure your safety. Now, regarding your sexual activity, can you tell me a little more about the types of sexual contact you have with your partner?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was starting to worry I was holding things up. Well… we have intercourse, sometimes. And… other things. You know, intimacy. It’s been a while, so we’re taking it slow. Mostly it’s just… touching. But yes, there has been intercourse a couple of times. It’s… not frequent. Does that make a difference? I always used to use… protection. But he's such a gentleman, I haven’t felt the need to mention it. Is that too much information? I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Helaina. You’ve provided me with all the information I need. It’s important for me to understand your situation completely. The fact that you have had intercourse, even infrequently, is relevant for PrEP consideration. To move forward, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick exam of your skin. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Blood pressure is probably going to be a little high, I just walked a few blocks to get here. But go ahead, do what you need to do. I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a proper check-up. Is it going to be cold? I always get chilly when I'm examined.
DOCTOR: Alright, Helaina. We can take things slowly, and I'll be mindful of your comfort. I'll make sure to use a warm stethoscope. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but that's understandable given your walk and a little bit of anxiety. I’m hearing a slight heart murmur, which we’ll want to monitor, but it doesn’t seem concerning at the moment. Everything else appears normal on the basic exam. Now, I’d like to draw some blood for the tests we discussed – kidney function, HIV screening, and hepatitis B. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Yes, go ahead with the blood tests. I’m used to needles, Medicare keeps me poked enough. Do you think he'll be okay with this? He’s very protective, my partner. He might worry if he finds out I'm taking pills and getting tested. He thinks I'm perfectly healthy as is. Is it okay if I don’t tell him right away? I just… I want to have all the information first. Before I worry him needlessly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina. I've inserted the needle to draw some blood. It will only take a few minutes. It's perfectly reasonable to want to have all the information before discussing it with your partner. You are the one undergoing the testing and treatment, and you are entitled to make informed decisions about your health. It's important to have open communication with your partner eventually, but you can do so on your own timeline. We can discuss the test results and PrEP options, and I can help you formulate a plan for how to discuss it with him if you'd like. Once the blood sample is sent to the lab, the results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Okay, good. That makes me feel a little better. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… what if the results are positive? What if I already have something? I… I haven't really been with anyone in so long, I just assumed… I don't even want to think about it. But… what then? Is there a treatment? A cure? I need to know, just in case.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Helaina, and it’s good you’re asking. It’s unlikely, given your history, but we need to consider all possibilities. If the results were to be positive for HIV, it doesn't necessarily mean a hopeless situation. There are very effective treatments available, called antiretroviral therapy . These medications can control the virus, allow you to live a long and healthy life, and, crucially, prevent transmission to others. While there isn’t a cure yet, treatment is so effective that people living with HIV can achieve an undetectable viral load, meaning they cannot transmit the virus sexually. We would discuss these options in detail if that were the case, and I would connect you with specialists who are experts in HIV care. For now, let’s focus on getting the test results back. Worrying prematurely won't help, and the likelihood is we're simply being proactive. .
