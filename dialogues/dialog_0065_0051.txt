DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my niece, she said I should come. Something about needing to know my blood type? She's a very organized girl, that one. I can't quite recall why it’s important, but she insisted. It’s a bit of a drive here, you know, from the farm.
DOCTOR: I see. Your niece is… proactive, shall we say. While knowing your blood type isn’t usually a pressing medical need, it can be helpful in certain situations. To clarify, are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, no, dear, nothing like that. I feel… well, I feel my age, maybe. A little creaky in the mornings, but that’s just getting old, I suppose. No, no symptoms. Just… doing what the niece says. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… let me think. The chickens have been laying fewer eggs, that’s something. And old Man Hemlock finally sold his prize bull. That was a big event around here. But… personally? No, not that I recall. I mostly just… keep to the farm, you know? Everything's been pretty steady. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: Steady is… good, I suppose. Let’s go through a quick review of your general health, just to be thorough. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. I’ve had… things. Old age comes with its share of bumps and bruises, you know? I think I had a bad bout of the flu, years ago. And my hip… it bothers me when it rains. But I’ve never been one for… serious illnesses, I don’t think. I used to be very strong, working on the rigs. But that was a long time ago. Did I mention the flu? I feel like I mentioned the flu.
DOCTOR: Yes, you did mention the flu. We’re trying to establish a complete picture of your medical history, Ms. Nini. Any hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations… oh, goodness. Let me see. There was that time… I think it was after I fell off the ladder, fixing the roof. My shoulder was terribly sore. I was in a small hospital, not too far from the port. But it was so long ago. Just a few days, I think. They gave me something for the pain. It was a very bright room, I remember that. And the nurses were very kind. But it was… a long time ago, you see. I'm not good with dates.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any surgeries, Ms. Nini?
PATIENT: Surgeries… now that’s a good question. I think… yes. My appendix, maybe? When I was a young woman. My mother made me go, she said it was very important. And… I think there was something with my knee, a long time ago, after an accident on the rigs. But it was… a very long time ago. They fixed it, though. It doesn’t bother me much anymore. Unless it rains, of course. Everything bothers me when it rains.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, with all due respect, it's difficult to get a clear picture of your medical background. Do you have any family members who might have this information?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You’re right, aren’t you? It’s all a bit… muddled, isn’t it? My niece, Isabella, she knows everything. She keeps all the records. She's very good with those things. Yes, Isabella would know. She handles all the paperwork, and she remembers all the dates. You should talk to Isabella. She worries so much, but she’s a good girl. Yes, ask Isabella. She'll tell you everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will need to contact Isabella. In the meantime, let's briefly discuss your current medications and any allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any pills, creams, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. I take this little blue pill every morning. Doctor Ramirez gave it to me. For… well, he said it was for my bones. And I put this ointment on my hands sometimes, when they get dry from working in the garden. It smells like lavender. And... I think that's it. I don't take much, dear. I prefer a good cup of chamomile tea when I'm feeling poorly. As for allergies... I don't believe I have any. Unless you count dust, but who doesn't get a little sneezy around dust?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I'm going to ask you some questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness, no, dear! Never! Not a drop of alcohol, and certainly no… recreational drugs! I was raised a respectable woman, you see. My husband, bless his soul, he liked a good glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I always stuck to chamomile tea. And smoking? Heavens, no! It's terrible for you. I always told my husband it was a foolish habit. No, dear, I have a very clean lifestyle. Except for maybe the occasional sweet biscuit with my tea. But that's hardly a vice, is it?
DOCTOR: Very well. Given the limited information, and to address your niece’s concern, I’d like to draw a small blood sample for a basic blood type and complete blood count. It will also allow us to check for any underlying issues given the vague history. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood sample? Well, I don't love needles, dear, but if Isabella thinks it's important... Yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. And you’ll be gentle, won't you? I do get a little faint sometimes. Is it a big needle?
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, Ms. Nini. The needle is quite small, and the process is very quick. I'll be as gentle as possible, and we have everything here to ensure you're comfortable. The phlebotomist will be right in. While we're waiting, perhaps we can discuss your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, a phlebotomist, is it? Fancy name! Well, alright then. As for my diet... Oh, I mostly eat what I grow, you see. Lots of tomatoes, and cucumbers, and beans. I make a lovely ratatouille. And chicken, of course. We have chickens, you see. Fresh eggs every morning! And I bake biscuits sometimes, when I'm feeling up to it. And I do enjoy a nice cup of chamomile tea, as I've mentioned. It's very soothing, you know. Perhaps a little too much sugar in it though... my niece always tells me I put too much sugar in everything. Is this important, dear? All the questions...
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, it’s important to gather as much information as possible, even details about your diet, to get a complete picture of your overall health. Please, try to relax. The phlebotomist will be here shortly. For now, let's just try to focus on remaining calm. We are simply trying to address your niece’s concerns and rule out any potential issues.
