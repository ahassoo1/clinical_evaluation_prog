DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. Specifically, starting to go. It just takes a long time, and it's not a strong stream, if you know what I mean. It's been going on for about a week now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. There's no need to be embarrassed – these things are quite common, and we'll figure it out together. It's helpful that you’ve noticed it's been happening for about a week or so. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It doesn’t really hurt, exactly. More like… a strain, you know? Like I have to push a little harder than usual. And it feels like I don't empty my bladder completely, even after I’ve gone. I’ve also noticed I’m going more often, especially at night. I usually don't wake up, but this past week I've had to get up once or twice.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it's not painful, but you’re experiencing strain, a feeling of incomplete emptying, and increased frequency, including waking up at night to urinate. That increased frequency at night is what we call nocturia. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Nocturia, you say? That sounds fancy. Well, let me see… I haven’t had any fever or chills. No pain in my back, and my urine looks normal, the usual color. No blood or anything like that. I suppose I am a little more tired than usual, but I'm 66, so that could be anything, right? I drink about the same amount of water as always, maybe a little less in the summer, because it’s so hot. Oh! And I haven't had any changes in my diet.
DOCTOR: That's all very good information, Ms. Yadao. No fever, no back pain, normal urine color, no changes in diet. You're right, feeling a bit more tired at 66 is perfectly normal, but it's good you mentioned it. And you haven’t noticed any significant changes in your fluid intake. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I take a small pill every morning. And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, if you believe that! I see Dr. Novak for my blood pressure, he's very good. I had a flu shot last year, and a tetanus booster a few years back. I don’t really have any allergies, except maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have controlled hypertension, a history of gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and seasonal hay fever. You're up to date on your flu and tetanus vaccinations. That's all good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my father… he had some heart trouble when he got older, but I don’t remember exactly what. They both lived to be quite old, though, into their eighties. My brother, he's still alive, very healthy, lives in Chicago. He doesn't have any major health problems that I know of. Honestly, we don’t talk about medical things much. It’s just not our style.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. Knowing about your mother’s diabetes and your father’s heart trouble is helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink alcohol either. Never really liked it. I used to garden a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I mostly read now, and watch a little television. I walk around the house, keep myself moving, but that's about it. I live alone, so I have to be practical.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Yadao. No smoking or alcohol use, and you try to stay active despite your knee issues. Okay, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’d also like to do a neurological exam, just to rule things out. And I'll need to check a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A urine sample… is that difficult? I had one done years ago, but I can’t remember exactly what’s involved. And a neurological exam… will you poke me with things? I don’t mind, as long as it helps.
DOCTOR: Not at all difficult, Ms. Yadao. We’ll provide you with a clean container, and you'll just need to provide a small sample when you’re able. As for the neurological exam, it's nothing to worry about. I'll be checking your reflexes, your strength, and your sensation – no poking involved! It’s just a way to assess how your nerves are functioning. Let’s start with the urine sample. I'll have the nurse bring you a container, and I'll explain everything again when she does. After that, we'll do the abdominal and neurological exam. Nurse, could you please bring a urine collection container to Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I’m glad you’re being thorough. It's just a bit unsettling when things don't work like they’re supposed to, you know? And I do appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel much more comfortable.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. It's perfectly natural to feel unsettled when things change. And that’s precisely why I’m here – to understand what’s happening and make sure you feel comfortable and cared for. While we're waiting for the nurse, let's quickly review your current medications. You mentioned a pill for your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of that medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… Lisinopril. And the dosage is 20 milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. It’s a little white pill. I haven’t had any problems with it, no side effects or anything. Dr. Novak keeps a close eye on my blood pressure, and he’s very happy with how it’s been controlled. He said it’s important to keep it down, to avoid any… complications. I try to remember to take it every day, but sometimes I forget. It's not a regular thing, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. Lisinopril 20mg daily. It's good to know you haven’t had any side effects and Dr. Novak is pleased with your control. Occasional missed doses are not uncommon, and we can discuss strategies to help you remember. Here is the container, Ms. Yadao. Please collect a small sample when you’re able, and let me know when you’ve finished. I’ll explain the process again if you'd like. There are instructions on the side of the container as well. Take your time with the sample. When you're ready, just let me know. Once we have that, we can move on to the physical exam.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you. I think I remember how to do this. It's just… a bit awkward, isn’t it? I'll go now. It might take a moment. And yes, please explain it again when I get back, just to be sure. I don't want to do it wrong. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. Take all the time you need, and I'll be happy to explain the process again when you return. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or need assistance. We'll take it one step at a time.
