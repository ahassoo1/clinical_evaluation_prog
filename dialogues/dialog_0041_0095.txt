DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have time for this. But fine. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face… feels sort of droopy on that side too. It’s quite upsetting, really. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is upsetting to wake up with sudden hearing loss and facial drooping. That definitely warrants checking things out. Just to clarify, this happened… this morning, when you woke up?
PATIENT: Yes, this morning. As I said. I don't understand why you need me to repeat myself. It wasn't gradual or anything, I just… couldn’t hear. And looking in the mirror, half my face looks like it’s melting. It’s rather obvious, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: You're right, it is obvious if you’re experiencing that. Apologies, I just like to be thorough. Sudden onset is definitely concerning. Okay… and has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I’ve never had anything like this happen. And I assure you, I have a very good constitution. I eat well, I sleep… when I can, and I generally take very good care of myself. This is… disturbing. Are you going to do something about it, or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I am going to do something about it. I just need a little more information first, to help me figure out the best course of action. Let’s do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? I haven’t got all day. Is this going to involve poking and prodding? Because frankly, I find that rather undignified. And is there a charge for this “exam”? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. The exam will involve me looking in your ears, checking your facial movements, and a few simple neurological tests. It won't be extensive. Just some quick checks. As for the cost… we can discuss that with the front desk after I’ve had a chance to assess things. Let’s just get through the exam first, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle. I do not appreciate being manhandled. Honestly, the things one has to put up with these days. And don't expect me to be chatty. I have a very important board meeting later.
DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, let me just take a look in your ears. Can you tell me if you’ve had any ear pain, ringing in your ears, or dizziness along with the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ear pain? No. Ringing… well, now that you mention it, there is a slight… buzzing, I suppose. But it's not constant. And dizziness… not exactly. More like a… a feeling of being off balance, perhaps. But I put that down to lack of sleep. It's probably nothing. Just get on with it, please. I have things to consider.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight buzzing and a feeling of being off balance. Thank you. The ear canal looks clear. I don’t see any obvious obstruction or infection. Now, I’m going to use this tuning fork… I’ll tap it and place it on your forehead, and then on the mastoid bone behind your ear. Just let me know if you can hear the sound, and when you hear it. Alright?
PATIENT: Must you explain everything? It’s rather patronizing. Fine, do whatever you need to do. Just be quick about it. And please, don't tap it too hard. My nerves are already quite frayed. This whole situation is deeply unsettling. I haven't felt this… vulnerable in years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you hear the tone in both locations?
PATIENT: No. I can't hear anything on this side. Nothing. And barely a faint whisper on the other. It’s… unnerving, to be so utterly cut off. Honestly, this is just dreadful. Are you sure you're qualified to do this? You seem awfully young. And all the explaining… it’s just… tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, hearing is significantly reduced on the left side, and diminished on the right. I understand your concern, and I assure you I am a qualified internal medicine physician. My age doesn’t affect my training or ability to assess you. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a few simple things. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Really? Smile? In my condition? This is ridiculous. Fine. There. Happy now? As you can see, it’s… not quite right. The left side doesn’t seem to be cooperating. Honestly, I look like a gargoyle. Is this going to be on the internet? I do not consent to being photographed.
DOCTOR: No, this won't be on the internet. I am simply assessing your facial muscle strength. Now, can you close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It feels… strained. And my eyelid keeps fluttering. Honestly, this is most unpleasant. I have a very important dinner reservation later, and I doubt I’ll be able to properly appreciate the food looking like this. Are you certain there's nothing simple you can do to fix this? A pill, perhaps? Anything?
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s… awkward. And rather undignified, if I may say so. Honestly, I feel like a performing seal. This is a complete waste of my time. Are you going to tell me what’s wrong, or am I going to have to consult another physician? I have a reputation to maintain, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what I've observed during the exam – the sudden hearing loss, facial weakness, incomplete eye closure, and tongue deviation – I'm concerned about a possible stroke, or what we call a Bell's palsy. It's too early to say for sure which it is, but these symptoms require immediate investigation. A stroke needs to be ruled out with imaging, like a CT scan or MRI, and even Bell's Palsy requires prompt evaluation and treatment to improve the chances of recovery.
PATIENT: A stroke? Are you serious? I'm… I'm fifty-nine years old, not ancient! I feel perfectly fine, apart from… this. This is preposterous! I eat well, I exercise… when I can. I do not have time for a stroke. I have important meetings, a dinner reservation… This is utterly unacceptable! What do you mean, “immediate investigation”? What kind of tests? Are they going to involve poking and prodding? And what about the dinner reservation? This is a disaster!
DOCTOR: I understand your shock and disbelief, Stephane. It's frightening to hear that possibility, and I apologize for delivering such concerning news. The tests to rule out a stroke involve imaging—a CT scan or MRI of the brain. It's a painless procedure; you'll lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. We need to do this quickly to determine the cause of your symptoms and begin treatment if necessary. I’m going to arrange for you to be transferred to the emergency room immediately. They are best equipped to perform the necessary tests and provide rapid treatment. We'll need to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm as well. I will also consult with a neurologist there. I know this is disruptive, but it’s vital for your health. Do you have any medical conditions or allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I’m aware of. And medical conditions… well, my late husband used to say I was a hypochondriac, but that was just his way of being difficult. Nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed twenty years ago, and I occasionally get migraines, but nothing debilitating. Honestly, this is all so… overwhelming! I haven’t been to a hospital in decades. And the emergency room? It's going to be… dreadful. What about my dinner reservation? And my board meeting tomorrow? This is ruining my life! Is there absolutely nothing else we can do? A pill? A scan at a private clinic? Anything to avoid the emergency room?
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, and I wish there were a simpler solution. However, given the possibility of a stroke, a rapid assessment in the emergency room is crucial. They can provide immediate care and determine the best course of action. Waiting or delaying could have serious consequences. A private scan won’t provide the same level of detail or immediate interpretation needed in this situation. Unfortunately, ruling out a stroke requires specific protocols and a facility equipped for immediate intervention if necessary. I will contact the emergency room to let them know you are coming, and I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. I will also document everything thoroughly and provide a detailed summary for the ER physicians. Do you have a family member or friend we can contact to come with you?
PATIENT: My daughter… she’s… complicated. And she lives out of state. I suppose I could call my assistant, Beatrice. She’s… efficient, if a bit nosy. But she’ll want a full report on everything, and I’m really not up to that right now. Just give me a moment. “Beatrice speaking.” “Beatrice, it’s me. Listen, I need you to do something for me. It’s rather urgent. I’m at the doctor’s office, and… well, it seems I may have had a stroke.”
