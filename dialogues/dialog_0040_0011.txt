DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Honcoop. Let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Osga, is it? Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need somethin’ signed, a paper, you understand. For… a little touch-up. A procedure. My nephew said I needed clearance from a real doctor 'fore I do it. He's a smart boy, that one. But really, it shouldn’t take long.
DOCTOR: A "touch-up"?
PATIENT: Yes, a touch-up. You know... to look a little… presentable. It’s… well, it’s about my appearance. Folks expect a certain thing, you see. I used to look much better, but time… it does things. And frankly, I don’t wanna be lookin’… old. Is that alright? Can we just get this signed? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Honcoop, I'm a family doctor, not a… cosmetic advisor. I need to understand what procedure you’re referring to. Just saying "touch-up" isn’t helpful. And I absolutely cannot sign anything without knowing what it is for, and making sure it’s safe for you. It’s my professional responsibility. Do you recall who is performing this procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… names escape me. Some fella, young man. He got a shop… over by the mall, I think. Advertised somethin’ about… liftin’ and… tighten’… things. He seemed legitimate. He said all I needed was a doctor’s say-so. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember the details. It was a good deal, and I want to look… better. Is that so hard to understand? I just want a signature. Do you need the exact name? Maybe my nephew knows.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, that’s… concerning. A procedure performed by someone you can't even name?
PATIENT: Well, he had a nice sign! And a clean buildin’. Look, I ain't a medical man. I worked with towers and wires my whole life. Not fancy doctors and… procedures. It’s a little somethin’ for me. Can we just skip the questions and get this done? I got a lunch appointment. And I don't like bein' kept waitin'.
DOCTOR: I'm going to ask you this one more time. What specifically are you hoping to have done?
PATIENT: Alright, alright! He said he could… smooth out my face. You know, these wrinkles… and maybe a little… liftin’ of the chin. Just to look… younger. It's not a big deal! He uses somethin’ injected under the skin. He showed me pictures, folks lookin’ much… fresher. Is that enough for you? Now, can we please get this over with? I'm a busy man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Injectables… Alright. Let me just pull up your records… You've never had any cosmetic procedures before, have you?
PATIENT: Never! I told you, Doctor, I work with towers! Radio waves and steel, not… creams and needles. This is my first time even thinkin' about somethin’ like this. I’m a simple man, really. And frankly, I don’t appreciate bein' interrogated about it. Just sign the paper and let me be on my way. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No allergies listed… blood pressure’s a bit elevated, but not alarming… Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Pre-existing? Doctor, I’m sixty-four years old! What sixty-four-year-old doesn't have somethin'? But nothin' serious. A little ache here, a little pain there. Normal wear and tear. I’ve been climbin' towers for forty years, you know. I'm tough. It ain’t like I got heart trouble or… somethin'. Just old. Now, about that signature… is this gonna take all day?
DOCTOR: "Just old" isn't a medical diagnosis, Mr. Honcoop. And neglecting to disclose medical history is a problem. You say you’re healthy enough to be climbin’ towers… are you on any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm… let me think. Oh, there's that little blue pill. For… you know… to help me sleep sometimes. Doctor said I could take it when I couldn't rest. And somethin' for my… waterworks. Gets a little tricky sometimes, with age. But that's it! Nothin' fancy. Just a little somethin' to keep me goin'. Now, can we please stop with the questions? I'm startin' to get upset.
DOCTOR: A sleep aid and something for urinary frequency… Alright. Do you have any history of blood clots, bleeding disorders, or skin infections?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Bleedin'? Doctor, I've been cut and bruised more times than you've had hot dinners climbin' those towers! Nothin’ serious. A little scrape here, a little cut there. Heals up fine. And skin infections? Maybe a little rash sometimes, from the sun. But I always put somethin’ on it. Now, are you gonna sign this paper or not? I really don’t have time for this. I got things to do, important things!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’m going to be frank with you. I am not comfortable signing this paper. This “procedure” you're describing, performed by someone with no identifiable credentials, and without a thorough medical evaluation… it’s reckless. It could have serious consequences. You're uninsured, you haven't disclosed your full medical history, and you’re seeking a cosmetic procedure from an unknown source. I cannot, in good conscience, participate in this. I would strongly advise you to reconsider. In fact, I recommend you consult a board-certified dermatologist before proceeding with anything. I'm not going to sign the paper. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: You… you won’t sign it? After all this? You’re wasting my time! I came here for a simple signature, a formality, and you're makin' a big deal out of nothin'! I don’t need your lectures, Doctor. I know what I'm doin'. And frankly, I think you’re just bein’ difficult. Fine! Keep my chart. I'll find someone else who understands common sense. Don't expect me back. .
