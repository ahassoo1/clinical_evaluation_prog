DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Gorga. It’s…well, it’s about making arrangements. Important arrangements, you understand. My husband and I have been discussing…what happens if one of us becomes…incapacitated. We want to be prepared. I believe you have forms for this? Something to clearly state our wishes. I don’t want any…unnecessary complications.
DOCTOR: Right, arrangements…advance care planning. Yes, I understand. It’s very responsible of you both to think about this now. Forms…yes, we have several. It sounds like you’re looking for a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare and perhaps a Living Will. We also have a POLST form, but that's more for serious illness. Now, just to be clear, when you say “incapacitated,” are we talking about a specific condition, or…just a general concern?
PATIENT: A general concern, Doctor. Really, is there a specific scenario one needs to detail? It’s quite obvious, isn’t it? A fall, a stroke…something debilitating. I simply want it understood that I make the decisions, while I am capable, and that my husband knows precisely what I want if I…am unable to express those wishes myself. I don't appreciate being asked to enumerate potential misfortunes. It feels rather…crude.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Chilla. You’re absolutely right. It was a clumsy question. I get… bogged down in details sometimes. We want to respect your wishes. So, let’s focus on who you want to make decisions, and what those decisions generally would be, should you become unable to communicate. Do you have a husband who you'd like to appoint as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Naturally. My husband, Jean-Pierre. He is perfectly capable. He understands my…preferences. Though, I do expect him to consult with me, if it is at all possible, before enacting anything. One should never assume, even in difficult situations. Is there a form for specifying that level of…collaboration? And please, Doctor, I trust you have forms in French as well. Jean-Pierre’s English, while adequate, is…not his strongest suit.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We have all the necessary forms, including French translations. And yes, we can definitely include a clause specifying his consultation with you, if possible. It’s a very reasonable request, and we want to be as clear as possible. Before we proceed with the forms, just quickly, are you currently under the care of any other physicians?
PATIENT: No. I manage my own health, thank you very much. I find most doctors these days are…overzealous with their interventions. A bit too quick to prescribe something for everything. Jean-Pierre occasionally sees a specialist for his…heart, but that is neither here nor there. We prefer to be proactive, not reactive. Are these forms…complicated? I haven't much patience for bureaucratic nonsense.
DOCTOR: They aren’t overly complicated, Ms. Chilla, but they do require careful consideration. We’ll go through them together, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It’s mostly about documenting your wishes clearly. We just need to ensure they are legally sound. Let’s start with the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. This designates Jean-Pierre as your healthcare proxy – the person who makes decisions for you if you can’t. It covers medical treatments, access to your medical records…things like that. Do you have any initial questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Access to my medical records? Does anyone else need to be informed? I would prefer to limit access to Jean-Pierre and, perhaps, our solicitor, Monsieur Dubois. I certainly don't want just anyone privy to my…personal information. And what constitutes a “medical treatment,” precisely? Is a simple vitamin infusion considered a “treatment”? These details matter, Doctor. Don’t you agree?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask those questions, Ms. Chilla. Details do matter. We can absolutely limit access to your records to Jean-Pierre and Monsieur Dubois. That’s easily done. And yes, “medical treatment” is broadly defined, and can include things like vitamin infusions, depending on the circumstances. We can specify the types of treatments you want Jean-Pierre to have the authority to approve, and which ones would require further discussion or a specific directive from you. Now, do you have any specific treatments you definitely want to avoid, or ones you’d want to ensure are always provided, regardless of the situation?
PATIENT: Resuscitation, Doctor. I do not wish to be resuscitated if…if there is no reasonable hope of recovery. I have seen enough of hospitals to know when it is…time. And I most certainly do not want to be kept alive artificially. No feeding tubes, no ventilators. A dignified exit is paramount. And please, include that in writing. Explicitly. Is that understood? I do not want any ambiguity on this point.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely understood, Ms. Chilla. We will include a very clear statement regarding your wishes regarding resuscitation and artificial life support. No resuscitation, no artificial ventilation, no feeding tubes. We will state that explicitly in the Living Will. This is a very important directive, and we want to be sure it’s documented accurately. To clarify, does this apply to any condition where there is no reasonable hope of recovery, or are there specific circumstances you’d like to exclude?
PATIENT: Any condition, Doctor. Any condition where there is no realistic prospect of a return to…a reasonable quality of life. I have thought about this extensively. I do not wish to be a burden. Or, frankly, a shadow of my former self. Is that sufficient clarity? I find this conversation rather…morbid, but necessary. Perhaps we should move onto the practicalities of signing these forms? And do you have pens? I prefer a fountain pen, if possible. A ballpoint simply won't do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, that is perfectly clear. We will document that explicitly. "No resuscitation, no artificial ventilation, no feeding tubes in any condition where there is no reasonable hope of recovery." I apologize if the conversation is difficult. It is a sensitive topic, and you are very responsible to consider these matters. We do have a fountain pen. One moment. Here you are. I have the forms prepared. They are witnessed, and we just need your signature. Do you have any questions before you sign?
PATIENT: Adequate. Hmm. This clause regarding "reasonable hope"... it seems rather vague. Who determines what is "reasonable," precisely? Is it merely the opinion of the attending physician? Or will there be a second opinion? I would prefer to have an independent assessment, should it be necessary. A neurologist, perhaps? It's all very well to state one’s wishes, but I don't want to be at the mercy of someone else's…subjective interpretation.
