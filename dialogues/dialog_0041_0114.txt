DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s Maribeth Vanderwiele. I’m here because… well, it's my breathing. It gets difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. I don't like it, and I thought I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing difficulties, especially when lying flat… that’s good you came in to get it looked at. About a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately a month. Perhaps a little longer, now that I think about it. It wasn't sudden, it just… gradually became more noticeable. I usually sleep propped up with pillows now. It's not terribly comfortable, but better than feeling like I’m suffocating.
DOCTOR: Right, gradually worsening… and pillows help. Okay. Do you notice anything else when you’re having trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, sometimes my ankles swell up a bit in the evenings. Not always, but frequently if I've been on my feet all day. And I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, but I assumed that was just… getting older. I don’t know if those things are connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling and increased fatigue... those could be connected, yes. Just trying to build a complete picture. When you say tired, is it more like general weakness, or trouble sleeping, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s more… a general weakness, I suppose. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, not particularly. But I wake up feeling like I haven't rested, even after a full night. It takes a bit longer to get going in the mornings. And I don't have the energy I used to for my hobbies. I used to enjoy gardening, but… it’s been harder lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue even with adequate sleep and difficulty with activities… Alright. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. That’s not it at all. It’s just… shortness of breath, tiredness, and these ankles. It's more a feeling of being uncomfortable and… restricted, if that makes sense. Not hurting, just… not right. And it’s worse when I’m trying to lie down.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just discomfort and restriction, worse when lying down. Let's talk a bit about your past health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. Years ago, I had high blood pressure, but it was managed with medication for a long time. The doctor took me off of it a few years back because he said it was under control. I also had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it's not very severe. Aside from that… nothing major, I don't think. I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, now controlled, arthritis, and gallbladder removal. Do you remember when you had the gallbladder surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It must have been… 1987, I believe. Yes, 1987. I was still married then, and we were living in Albuquerque. It was a fairly standard procedure, as I recall. I was in the hospital for a few days, but I recovered quickly. It hasn’t bothered me since. And the blood pressure… the doctor removed me from the medication in, oh, 2020, I think? It was around the beginning of the pandemic, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder in 1987, blood pressure medication stopped in 2020. Good to know. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I've been very lucky in that regard. I can eat shellfish, nuts, everything without any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, I'll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's about it. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer to let things heal naturally, if I can. It’s never really been necessary, until… this breathing issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. I understand. Let's get it over with. I have a library book due back on Friday, you see, and I'd like to have time to renew it if necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally for me. Blood pressure is 148/92. I do notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Your heart sounds are a little… muffled, and I can hear some congestion in your lungs. It's subtle, but it’s there. Now, I'd like to order a chest x-ray and an EKG, just to get a better look at what's going on. And I’d like to draw some blood to check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes for the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. All right. X-ray, EKG, and blood work. I suppose it's best to be certain. I just… I hope it's nothing too serious. It’s just a bit of bother, all this. I have a luncheon with the book club next Tuesday. But if it’s necessary, I will reschedule. What exactly will these tests tell you? And where will they be done?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. These tests will help us determine the cause of your shortness of breath and swelling. The x-ray will give us a picture of your lungs and heart to see if there’s any fluid buildup or other abnormalities. The EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart. The blood tests will help us assess your kidney function and look for any signs of infection or other underlying conditions. They can all be done right here in the clinic, at the lab down the hall. I’ll write the orders now, and the lab technician will come get you when they're ready. It's likely we'll have the results back within a day or two. I want to rule out things like heart failure or pneumonia. It’s important to be thorough. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Rule out heart failure and pneumonia. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly, Doctor. That does ease my mind a bit. All right. I’ll just sit here and wait for the technician, then. And perhaps I should call the library and renew that book, just in case? I don’t want to incur any late fees.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea about the book, yes. Here are your orders. The lab technician, Sarah, is usually pretty quick. She'll be in shortly. And please, if you feel any worsening of your breathing at all while you're waiting, or if you feel any chest pain, let me or the nurse know immediately. Just take a few deep breaths, and we’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will remember that. And I will let you know if anything changes. Deep breaths. I always did enjoy a good mystery. Hopefully, this isn’t a too complicated one.
