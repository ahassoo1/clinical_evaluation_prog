DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… it’s the university, you see. The students. Honestly. It’s quite… draining. I believe I requested this appointment to discuss… the stress of it all. Though, I haven’t much time to dedicate to this, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: The university… and the students are causing you stress?
PATIENT: “Causing” is… a rather simplistic way to put it. They lack discipline, a basic understanding of research, and… frankly, a respect for their elders. It's quite disheartening, you know. I've been teaching for… a very long time. Long enough to see standards decline, certainly. Is this going to be a lengthy process? I have a rather full schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling frustrated with your students and the changes you've observed over time. It sounds like this has been ongoing for a while. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, perhaps we can explore how this stress is manifesting itself?
PATIENT: Manifesting? Are you suggesting I’m… unwell? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly capable. It’s simply… a weariness. A professional disappointment. I sleep… adequately. I eat… reasonably. It's not as if I'm prone to fits or anything of the sort. Though, my appetite has been somewhat diminished lately. But that's likely the quality of the university cafeteria. It’s dreadful, simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Diminished appetite is a change we should note. And while I appreciate your reassurance, even the most capable individuals can be affected by prolonged stress. Has this diminished appetite been accompanied by any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. My tailor did mention… a slight adjustment was required to my trousers. But I attribute that to… better tailoring, perhaps. They’ve switched suppliers, you see. It's all quite… inconvenient. Honestly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? I fail to see how discussing my trousers is relevant to… the matter at hand. I simply wish they’d employ students with a modicum of intelligence. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: While I understand your frustration with the students, it's important to consider all aspects of your well-being. A change in clothing size, even attributed to a new tailor, can be an indicator of a broader issue. Approximately how much weight would you estimate you’ve lost, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. I haven’t weighed myself recently. I find such things… vulgar. Perhaps five, maybe seven pounds? It’s hardly a crisis. It’s simply… less to carry around. I maintain a brisk pace, you see. A great deal of walking. To and from the library, mostly. And the occasional… lecture hall. But truthfully, it's probably just the trousers. I assure you. This is rather… tedious. Are we nearing the end of this assessment? I have a faculty meeting at two.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Let’s move on. Aside from the appetite and weight change, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, nothing of consequence. A slight… irritability, perhaps. But that’s to be expected when dealing with… the current generation. And I've been having trouble… focusing, I suppose. Not that my intellect is failing, you understand. It's simply… distracting. All the noise. The chatter. The… social media. It permeates everything. Is this all you need to know? Honestly, I thought a simple endorsement of my need for a quieter office would suffice.
DOCTOR: Trouble focusing… and irritability. Has this irritability manifested in any specific ways, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Well… I may have… raised my voice during a seminar last week. A student was… persistently off-topic. And I did… express my dissatisfaction with the university’s new curriculum rather forcefully in an email. To the department head. But honestly, Doctor, it was justified. They've lowered standards to an unacceptable degree. It's hardly a symptom, it's… righteous indignation. I fail to see what any of this has to do with my request. I simply want a more peaceful work environment. Is that too much to ask? And I have a meeting, as I’ve mentioned. Several times.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I've noted your concerns regarding stress, irritability, difficulty focusing, diminished appetite, and weight loss. It's good you're aware of these changes. I would like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Doctor, I am eighty-seven years old. Of course, I have had things. Minor ailments, typical of one's age. But nothing of significance. A touch of arthritis, perhaps. And a rather persistent cough during the winter months. But I assure you, nothing that requires… a lengthy diagnosis. I’ve always been a remarkably healthy individual. And I don’t believe dwelling on past… indispositions is particularly productive. Are we going to discuss the office, or simply catalogue my ailments? I really must insist… I have a meeting. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. There was… a tonsillectomy, many decades ago. And a rather minor procedure on my knee, sometime in the nineties. A sports injury, you see. Though, I haven’t engaged in any sport since the war. It’s hardly relevant, Doctor. Are you building a medical dossier, or attempting to ascertain my suitability for a more peaceful office? This is becoming rather… absurd. I assure you, my physical health is… adequate. I can walk, I can talk, I can… generally function. That should suffice. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Doctor, my family is… dispersed. My brother emigrated to Canada, and my sister passed away several years ago. They both lived… relatively unremarkable lives. No history of… anything particularly alarming, if that's what you're implying. Heart trouble, perhaps. But that’s quite common, isn’t it? Honestly, I fail to see the relevance of tracing the medical lineages of distant relatives. This is… quite enough. I must reiterate, I came here seeking a solution to a specific problem – a stressful work environment. Not a genealogical investigation. If you’ll excuse me… I really must leave. The meeting… it starts in precisely seventeen minutes. I trust this will be sufficient information for you to endorse my request?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. We've covered a great deal. Now, before we conclude, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, are you implying I’m… infirm? I take a small dose of aspirin each morning, for… general health. And a supplement for my… joints. But that’s hardly a regimen worthy of documentation. Honestly, I find this line of questioning… rather insulting. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of managing my own health. I simply wish to discuss my office. I have a faculty meeting. A very important faculty meeting. I really must insist… this has been quite enough. Are we finished? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Based on our conversation, you're experiencing stress related to your work environment, which is manifesting as irritability, difficulty focusing, diminished appetite, and a recent slight weight loss. Given your age, it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes for these symptoms. I recommend a blood test to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out anemia. Additionally, an EKG would be prudent to assess your heart health. I'll also write you a referral to a therapist specializing in stress management. Until we have those results, I can write you a temporary note for a quieter office space, though it's not a permanent solution. Do you understand?
