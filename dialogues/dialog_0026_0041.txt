DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I’ve been feeling… weaker. It’s been happening slowly, over a while now. The legs, mostly. Makes walking a bit difficult sometimes. My wife, she says I’m moving slower, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, primarily in the legs, developing gradually over time. And your wife has noticed a change in your walking speed. I appreciate you both sharing that. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe six months ago? It started as just feeling a little tired after a walk, but it’s gotten more… noticeable since then. Not a sudden thing, you understand. More of a… creeping feeling.
DOCTOR: A creeping feeling over about six months… that’s helpful. And is it just your legs that feel weak, or do you notice it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Mostly the legs, yes. But sometimes… my hands feel a little clumsy, too. Not all the time, but when I’m trying to do something small, like button a shirt, it can be… harder than it used to be. It doesn’t hurt, just… doesn’t work as smoothly, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness and clumsiness in both your legs and hands, though the legs are more prominent. No pain, just a difficulty with coordination and smoothness of movement. Have you noticed any other changes along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my vision’s been a little blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just my age, you understand? And… I get tired easier. Even after a good night's sleep, I can feel worn out pretty quick. My wife does most of the housework now, I can't keep up like I used to.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and increased fatigue… okay. It’s good you’re mentioning these things, even if you think they might just be related to age. We want to consider everything. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite is… okay, I suppose. Not much different than usual. And my weight… well, I think I’ve lost a little. Not a lot, but my trousers feel a bit looser, you understand? I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. It’s my wife who usually does that.
DOCTOR: A slight weight loss, noticed by your wife. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. And… oh, a few years back, the doctor told me I have something called… Multiple Sclerosis. That’s what she said. I don't remember all the details, to be honest. She gave me some pills, and I’ve been taking them ever since.
DOCTOR: Multiple Sclerosis… alright. And you’ve been taking medication for that, as prescribed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every day. I take them with my breakfast. My wife makes sure I don't forget. She's very good at keeping me on track. I can’t always remember the name of the pill, but I know I take it regularly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It’s helpful you have support with remembering your medication. Let me just pull up your records here… ah, yes. I see you were diagnosed with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis approximately 8 years ago, and you’ve been on… [pauses, reading]… Dalfampridine. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Dalfampridine. That’s the one. It's a mouthful, isn’t it? I just ask my wife to order it for me, and she handles the rest. I don't pay much attention to the names, just that I take it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just the usual bumps and bruises from playing rugby when I was younger, but nothing that required a doctor to cut me open!
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had arthritis, bad in her hands. And my older brother, he had something with his heart, a long time ago. But other than that, not that I know of. My family wasn't one for going to the doctor much. We just toughed things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and a heart condition in your brother. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I drink very little alcohol. Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. My wife doesn't really care for it, so I don't have it often. I used to be very active, playing rugby and all, but now… well, it's harder to get around.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks when she gets my pills, and she’d remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t she? She has a very good memory.
DOCTOR: She certainly sounds very attentive. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me, Mr. Astores. Okay, so we've discussed your current symptoms, your medical history, family history, and lifestyle. Given your history of Multiple Sclerosis, the gradual onset of weakness, the clumsiness in your hands, and the fatigue, it's possible this is a flare-up of your MS. However, given the new symptoms like the blurry vision and weight loss, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam to assess your strength, reflexes, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If you think it’s best, then I trust your judgment. I just want to understand what’s going on, and if this is something to worry about. Anything you think is best, I'm happy to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It will only take a few minutes. First, could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here I am.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this small hammer. It may feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay… good response on the right, a bit diminished on the left. And a bit diminished in both arms as well. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, grip strength is slightly reduced bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to push against my hands as I resist. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay… strength is slightly reduced in both arms and legs. Now, let's check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: Okay… slight difficulty with coordination. Alright, thank you, Mr. Astores. That was helpful. Given the findings of the exam, the diminished reflexes, reduced strength, and slight coordination issues, along with your history of MS, I do believe a flare-up is likely. However, the weight loss and blurry vision warrant further investigation to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. The blood work will help us look for any underlying inflammation or other issues. The MRI will allow us to assess the activity in your brain and spinal cord and see if there are any new lesions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment. Blood work and an MRI… whatever you think is best to get to the bottom of things. It’s good to know you're being thorough. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and imaging center now. The lab work should be relatively quick, and we can usually get an MRI scheduled within a few days. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue taking your Dalfampridine as prescribed. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for further management of your MS. They will be able to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment as needed. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. A neurologist… yes, that makes sense. And I will keep taking my pills, as I always do. My wife will make sure of it. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we're doing something to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. I’ll also give you a prescription for some vitamin D supplements. Studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency can worsen MS symptoms, and it’s good to keep your levels up. Here are the prescriptions and the referral form. The lab results should be available in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment once the MRI results are in. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly, and I feel quite reassured. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for your kind attention. My wife will be happy to hear all of this as well.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. It was my pleasure. If anything comes up between now and your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Get well soon, and please give my regards to your wife.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I’m sure she’ll be pleased to hear it. Bye bye to you as well.
