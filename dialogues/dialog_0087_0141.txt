DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Soodeen. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Honestly, it’s this…itchiness. All over, really. Started a few weeks back, just a little thing, but it’s gotten worse. It’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itching that has been worsening over the past few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t really look like anything, you know? No rash, no bumps, just…itchy skin. It's all over, but it seems worse on my arms and back. And it's not like a bug bite itch – it’s more…deep? Hard to explain. It doesn’t really go away, either. Lotion helps for a minute, maybe, but then it’s back. It's just…constant. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. An itch without any visible rash is certainly something we need to investigate. When did you first notice the itch starting?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It was right around…the 15th of July, I reckon. Maybe a little before. I was puttering around in the garden, pruning the roses, and that evening I noticed my arms felt…off. Not painful, just…irritated. At first I thought it was just from the rose bushes, but it didn’t go away like it usually does after a bit of washing. It just…kept itching. I remember because the grandkids were visiting that weekend, and I was trying not to scratch in front of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around July 15th, after gardening. And it hasn’t resolved with typical remedies. Have you tried any over-the-counter medications for itching besides lotion?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I tried some of that Benadryl cream, you know, the one for insect bites? Didn’t do much, to be honest. And I took some Benadryl pills a couple of times, but they just made me sleepy. Didn't really take the itch away. I'm not a big fan of taking pills if I don't have to, to be perfectly honest. I'd rather just…figure out what's causing it. My wife…well, she always had a good remedy for everything. I miss her advice.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing someone makes everything harder. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Let's move on to some other questions to help me understand what might be going on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. She was a nurse, so she kept a close eye on things like that. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. No bee stings, no rashes from poison ivy…nothing. I can’t think of anything at all. I even tried a new brand of soap last month, just to see if it was that, and it didn’t make a difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you said you tried a new soap without any change. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just my Medicare stuff, you know, for blood pressure. I take a small pill every morning. And…oh! Sometimes I take fish oil. My daughter told me it was good for my heart. Just a couple of capsules a day, nothing fancy. That’s it, really. No other vitamins or anything like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. My wife was always on me about that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for blood pressure and fish oil occasionally. Do you have any past medical problems, like diabetes, kidney disease, or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with anything serious. Had the usual colds and flus over the years, but nothing major. My wife…she had some trouble with her heart in the end, but I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I used to walk a lot, before…well, before everything. I haven’t been as active lately, I admit. But generally, I’ve been lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major past medical problems. And you mentioned your wife had heart trouble. Has anyone else in your family had skin problems, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. My sister, on my mother’s side, she always had…well, not exactly skin problems, but she had terrible allergies. Hay fever, mostly. Sneezing all the time. And her daughter, my niece, she had eczema when she was a little girl, but she grew out of it, I think. My father’s side…not that I recall. They were mostly farmers, tough folk, didn’t really complain much about anything. It’s hard to remember, honestly. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, some allergies and eczema in the family. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not at all. Never been much of a drinker. My wife didn't approve, and I didn't want to upset her. And I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My father smoked, and I saw what it did to him. Horrible cough, couldn’t breathe…no, thank you. And drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Just tea and gardening, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll just take a look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your lymph nodes. It shouldn't take long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm ready when you are. I just want to get to the bottom of this itch, you know? It’s driving me a bit crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m not seeing any rash or obvious lesions, which is consistent with what you described. Your skin feels generally normal, although it is a little dry. Lymph nodes feel normal in size and consistency. Heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not significantly. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Do you have any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, Doctor. Just the itch. You can press as hard as you need to. Honestly, I barely notice the pressure. It's just… a constant irritation. It's all over, really. I feel like I'm imagining things sometimes. Is it possible it's just…stress? My wife passed away last year, and I haven't been sleeping well since.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Grief can manifest in many ways, and skin symptoms can certainly be one of them. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I’m going to order some blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, liver function, kidney function, and thyroid levels. We'll also do a test to rule out any allergic reactions. These tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying medical cause for your itch. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do them. I just want to figure out what's going on. A little blood work is no trouble at all. When will I get the results? And…will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab results usually take about three to five business days. The lab will send the results directly to me here at the clinic. I'll review them as soon as they come in and call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a hypoallergenic moisturizer to help with the dryness. I’ll also suggest an over-the-counter antihistamine, like loratadine, to see if it provides any relief. Just be aware that it can cause drowsiness, so start with a low dose. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Hypoallergenic moisturizer and the antihistamine...I can do that. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for ordering the tests. It puts my mind at ease knowing we're trying to figure this out. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. We'll get these tests done and hopefully have some answers for you soon. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
