DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, please. Straight to it is good. I have things to do today, you understand. Is this about… the little things I forget? It is worrying me, but I do not want to waste time.
DOCTOR: "Little things," you say. Right. Well, forgetting things can be a number of things, Ms. Alvara. It’s rarely something serious, but we must rule things out. To begin, could you describe these “little things”?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… difficult to explain. Not big things. I remember dates, important events… my husband’s birthday, of course. But… sometimes I will go to the kitchen to get something – tea, usually – and I forget what I went there for. Or I will be speaking with someone, and the word… the right word… it just vanishes. It is… frustrating. And it happens more often now. I do not think it was like this before.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, perhaps… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It was slow at first, very subtle. I thought it was just… getting older. I am 53, you know. But now… it is happening almost every day. I noticed it more during the warmer weather, perhaps. The heat bothers me.
DOCTOR: Six months, and potentially linked to the warmer weather... Interesting. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside these memory lapses?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… I have been feeling… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And my head… sometimes it feels a little… fuzzy. Not a headache, exactly. Just… not clear. Also, my blood pressure has been… high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that. I do not remember the name of the pill, unfortunately. It is white, I think.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, fatigue, and a “fuzzy” head... And you said you're on medication for the blood pressure. We’ll need to get the name of that. Do you have any difficulty with your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty with balance. I am a tall woman, you see, and always have been. Very steady. And no problems with coordination. I still do all my gardening, you know. It is important to keep busy. I bend, I lift… everything is as it should be. I am just… forgetful, now. That is the main problem. A very annoying problem.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination, Ms. Alvara. Just to rule out any obvious underlying issues. I'd like to check your reflexes, your balance – though you say it’s good – and a quick neurological assessment. It will not take long.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to get to the bottom of this quickly, if that is possible. Please, let us hurry, shall we? I have appointments later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, have a seat here on the examination table. We’ll begin with your reflexes. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is this alright? I hope I am not a bother. I used to be a very good patient, always following instructions. But these little… lapses… they make things difficult, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, good. Now the other one. Taps the other knee. Both reflexes are present and equal, though a bit diminished. Now, please close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers. Gently touches Ms. Alvara’s fingertips on both hands.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I am ready. Pauses, concentrating. Now? Is that now? Pauses again. Yes. I feel your touch. This hand… and this hand. Are they both the same? Is this a test? I do not understand.
DOCTOR: It is a simple assessment, Ms. Alvara. Both hands registered a response, though it was…slightly delayed on the left side. Now, I would like you to follow my finger with your eyes, but do not move your head. Slowly moves a finger in an ‘H’ pattern in front of Ms. Alvara’s face.
PATIENT: I am following, Doctor. Up… down… left… right… Yes. I am trying very hard not to move my head. It is difficult, you know. I have a long neck. Very long. And sometimes it feels… stiff. But I am following. I think. Are you seeing what you need to see?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Your eye movements are… slightly sluggish, particularly to the left, and there’s a mild nystagmus – a slight involuntary movement – that I'm noting. Now, I would like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – just to get a baseline. Begins taking Ms. Alvara’s blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I hope everything is alright. My blood pressure is usually… quite high, you know. I worry about it. It is a terrible thing, high blood pressure. I try to eat healthy, but… forgetfulness makes it difficult to remember what I have eaten! It is a vicious circle. Is the cuff tight? It feels a little tight.
DOCTOR: It is within acceptable limits for measurement, Ms. Alvara, though still elevated - 148/92. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is normal. Pauses, looking at the chart thoughtfully. Considering your symptoms, the physical examination findings, and your history of high blood pressure, I suspect we are dealing with a case of… vascular cognitive impairment. It is a broad term, but it aligns with the diminished reflexes, sluggish eye movements, and memory lapses, particularly given your age and blood pressure history.
PATIENT: Vascular… what? Impairment? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Am I… losing my mind? Please, do not use such complicated words. I just want to know if I can still… live a normal life. Can I still garden? Can I still remember my grandchildren’s names? Tell me plainly, Doctor. Do not frighten me.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Alvara, please try to remain calm. It does not mean you are “losing your mind”. It simply means that the blood vessels in your brain may not be receiving optimal blood flow, which can affect cognitive function – thinking, memory, and so on. It is often associated with high blood pressure, as we’ve discussed. As for gardening and remembering your grandchildren, it's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. We need to rule out other possibilities and assess the extent of the impairment. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including an MRI of the brain. Also, a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions is necessary. Pauses, already writing a referral note. I will also advise strict blood pressure control, a healthy diet, and regular exercise – as much as possible, given your condition. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI… and more tests… It sounds… complicated. And expensive. I do not have much money, you understand. My husband… he left me nothing. But… if it will help me remember… if it will let me continue gardening… then I suppose I must do it. But… can you tell me, Doctor… honestly… is it… curable? Or is this something I will just have to… live with? And will I remember things, eventually? Please. Be frank with me. I do not want false hope.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Alvara, let us be realistic. Vascular cognitive impairment is often progressive, meaning it can worsen over time. There is no cure, per se. However, with aggressive management of your blood pressure, a healthy lifestyle, and appropriate medication – if the neurologist deems it necessary – we can potentially slow down the progression and manage your symptoms. As for remembering things… it's difficult to say definitively. Some cognitive function may be restored with treatment, but it’s unlikely you’ll regain full memory. The sooner we begin treatment, the better your chances. I will write the referral to Dr. Petrov, a neurologist I trust. He will order the MRI and blood tests and discuss treatment options with you in detail. Here is the referral form. You’ll need to schedule an appointment with his office as soon as possible. Hands the form to Ms. Alvara. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you… for your time. And for being… frank with me. It is… frightening. But… I will make the appointment with Dr. Petrov. I must. For my grandchildren, if for no other reason. Is there anything… anything at all I should do before the appointment? Any foods to avoid? Anything to help me remember? Even a little?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mrs. Alvara, there are no miracle cures. Focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle – diet, exercise, and stress reduction. And… try to write things down. Keep a daily journal. It may help, and it certainly won't hurt. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Begins gathering papers, signaling the end of the consultation. .
