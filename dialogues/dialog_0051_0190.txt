DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s this unsteadiness, I suppose. It’s… difficult to explain. I feel off-balance sometimes. It’s not constant, but it’s worrying me. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I might not recall all the details perfectly.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness. That’s a good place to start. And it's perfectly alright if you don't remember everything perfectly; we'll work through it together. When you say "sometimes," could you tell me roughly how often this happens?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. It’s… hard to say exactly. Perhaps… a few times a week? Maybe more when I’m… tired, or after work. It’s been happening for… a while now, I believe. A few months, at least. It just… comes and goes. I don’t recall any particular incident that started it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. A few times a week, more with fatigue… and no specific trigger you recall. Alright. And when you feel this unsteadiness, can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not quite dizziness, Doctor. It's… more like I'm going to fall, but I usually don’t. Like my feet aren’t quite… connected to the ground properly. A little wobbly, perhaps? And sometimes… a sort of lightness in my head, but not a spinning sensation. I hope that explains it a little. It’s so difficult to put into words.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it very well, actually. “Wobbly,” “not quite connected,” “lightness in the head”… those are all helpful. Not spinning, that’s good to know. Does anything seem to make it better, or worse, besides fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Resting helps, definitely. Sitting down, or just… stopping what I’m doing. I haven't noticed anything that specifically worsens it, other than being tired. Work… being on my feet for long periods… that doesn't help, obviously. But it’s not like a direct cause-and-effect, if you understand. I mean, I work long hours, and it doesn't always happen afterward. It’s… frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating. Alright, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me see… I have been feeling rather tired a lot, as I mentioned. And… my vision isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be, I suppose. I just assumed it was from… age. I haven't noticed anything else particularly. Oh, and… sometimes my hands feel a little numb, but only occasionally. It’s not constant. I work with machinery all day, so I thought it might be that.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some blurry vision, and occasional numbness in your hands. That’s helpful. Let's move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. Um… well, my late husband always handled all of that. I… I believe I had high blood pressure at one point, but it was… a long time ago. And I had a surgery on my knee, years ago, after a small accident at work. Other than that… I don’t recall anything significant. I do take medication for… something, but I can’t quite remember what it's for. It’s a small, white pill. I apologize. My memory is truly dreadful.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll figure it out. It sounds like you may have had hypertension in the past and had knee surgery. I’ll take a look at your chart to confirm. And you mentioned a white pill you take regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, the white pill. It's… small and round, I believe. I take it every morning. I honestly don't know why I take it. My husband… he always managed the medications. I’ve been meaning to ask someone, but… it slipped my mind, I suppose. It’s rather embarrassing, to be so unaware of my own health.
DOCTOR: It's not embarrassing at all, Lilyanna. Many people find themselves in similar situations. Let me see what the records say about this pill. Alright, it appears you are currently prescribed Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension. It’s a common medication for high blood pressure. Also, the records confirm you had a right knee arthroscopy in 2018. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds familiar. For blood pressure, right. Thank you for reminding me. And the knee… 2018, yes. That was… unpleasant. Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't had any… reactions to anything, as far as I remember. Perhaps… a slight itch when I use certain soaps, but nothing serious. I wouldn't say I have any true allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, mild sensitivity to some soaps. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. My mother… she had diabetes, I believe. And my father… he had heart problems. He… passed away when I was quite young. I don’t recall any other significant illnesses in the family, to be honest. My family wasn’t… particularly forthcoming about health matters, if you understand. It was… not something we discussed openly. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Lilyanna. Knowing about the diabetes and heart problems in your family is important. It’s alright that you don’t have a lot of details; we work with what we have. And finally, just a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I work very hard, and I need to be sharp and alert for my job. It wouldn't be responsible. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Lilyanna. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. I hope I won’t be too much trouble. I do apologize if I’m… slow to respond sometimes. It’s just… my mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You aren't trouble at all, Lilyanna. Take your time. It's perfectly alright. Your blood pressure is 148 over 88. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. Let's check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I'd like you to stand up for me, if you're able. We'll do a quick balance test. Please stand with your feet together, and close your eyes for a moment. Alright, good. A little bit of sway, but generally stable. Now, walk a few steps forward, and then back.
PATIENT: Alright, I’m standing. Oh… it’s a bit wobbly. I’m trying to stay still. It’s… difficult to balance, honestly. I feel… less steady than usual, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that, Lilyanna. It does seem like your balance is a bit compromised. That’s helpful information. Please, sit down. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished, but within normal limits. I'm also going to check your feet for sensation. Sensation is intact. Overall, the neurological exam is largely normal, but the diminished reflexes and unsteady balance are something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know it’s not completely abnormal. But the unsteady balance is worrying me, as you know. What do you think is causing it? Is it something serious? I do apologize for taking up your time.
DOCTOR: You aren’t taking up my time at all, Lilyanna. It’s my job to help you figure this out. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, there are a few possibilities. The combination of your unsteady balance, slightly diminished reflexes, and elevated blood pressure could be indicative of a few different things. It could be related to your blood pressure – sometimes uncontrolled hypertension can cause dizziness and balance problems. It could also be related to a mild inner ear issue, or even a vitamin deficiency. It’s less likely, but we should also consider the possibility of a neurological issue, though your reflexes don’t point strongly in that direction. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I’d like to do a blood test to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. I also want to check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes. And I think an EKG would be helpful to assess your heart function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. Blood tests, EKG… whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel… stable again. And… if it is something serious… what are the treatment options? I’m a little frightened, if I’m honest. My late husband always handled these things, and I… I don’t know what to expect.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to feel frightened when you’re facing the unknown. And it’s alright that you’re not sure what to expect; that's why I’m here. Let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We need to get the test results first. But to answer your question, if the tests reveal high blood pressure, treatment typically involves lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress reduction – and medication to lower your blood pressure. If it’s a vitamin deficiency, we can correct it with supplements. And if, hypothetically, it’s a neurological issue, treatment options vary depending on the specific diagnosis, but could include medication, physical therapy, or other interventions. I want to assure you that we’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll get the test results, discuss them thoroughly, and come up with a plan together. I’ll also provide you with resources and support every step of the way. Now, I’m going to write you a lab order for the blood tests and an order for an EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and the EKG technician will be right here in the clinic. After the tests are completed, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly okay, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I truly appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood tests done right away. And then the EKG. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. That’s what I’m here for. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need any assistance. The nurses down the hall will be happy to help. And remember, we’ll figure this out together. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment. .
