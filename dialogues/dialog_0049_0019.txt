DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. My wife... she wants... a baby. We have been married a long time, but… it is not happening. She thinks we should talk to someone, make sure everything is okay. I forget... what do you call it? Before… you try? It is for planning, yes?
DOCTOR: Planning… Right. You’re referring to preconception counseling and fertility evaluation, Mr. Carlotta. You and your wife are considering starting a family and want to ensure everything is medically sound before attempting to conceive. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… sounds right. She is very organized, my wife. I just… go along. I am a little old, maybe? To be having a baby. But she says it does not matter, with the doctors now. Is that true, Doctor? I make little things with metal and plastic, you see. Not babies.
DOCTOR: Well, age can be a factor, certainly. But modern medicine has made advancements, as your wife says. It's not about being old, it's about overall health. Let's start with your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly…? Hmm. Not so much, Doctor. I feel okay, mostly. A little tired, sometimes. But I work with my hands, all day. Metal can be hard on the body. I have Medicare, I think. My wife handles those things. I had some trouble with my… stomach, a long time ago. But it was fixed, I think. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, infrequent doctor visits, some past stomach trouble... Medicare is helpful. Let’s try to be more specific about this "stomach trouble." Do you recall what the issue was?
PATIENT: Hmm… very difficult to remember. It was… pain, yes? A lot of pain. And… they took something out, I think? A little piece. I was in the hospital for a few days. Long ago, when we first came to this country. Before I started making the little models. It didn’t bother me much after that, so I forgot about it. Is that… bad, Doctor? For… the baby planning?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Mr. Carlotta. It’s important to know what was removed and why. Did they give you a diagnosis at the time?
PATIENT: Diagnosis…? I… I don't remember any fancy words. The doctor spoke quickly, and my English was not so good then. My wife was there, she would know. She keeps all the papers, everything. She said it was… something blocking things? And they took it out so things could… flow again. I mostly remember the pain, and then feeling better. Is it okay if I ask my wife to bring the papers? She is very good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be… helpful, Mr. Carlotta. Having those records will give us a clearer picture of your medical history. In the meantime, let’s move on to some general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I don't take much medicine. Sometimes, for a headache, or a little cough. But nothing special. I eat everything. My wife makes wonderful food from Somalia, very spicy. No problems with food, or anything like that. I just get… tired sometimes, like I said. But that is just from the work, I think. Metal is heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And you mentioned fatigue. Are you experiencing any other symptoms – any changes in your weight, bowel habits, or urine output?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Weight, maybe a little bit? I don’t weigh myself. I eat well, my wife makes sure of that. Bowel habits… I go to the toilet, yes, when I need to. Everything seems normal there. Urine… I pee, like everyone else. I am sorry, Doctor. I don't understand why you are asking so many questions. Is something wrong? Is it bad that I am old? My wife said…
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I am simply gathering information to ensure a comprehensive assessment. It's standard procedure. I assure you, age alone is not necessarily a problem, but we need to evaluate your overall health to determine the best course of action. Now, do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter remedies, regularly or occasionally?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no medicines. Not usually. Sometimes, for my knees, they ache after a long day. But I just rub them, and rest. My wife gives me a cream sometimes, smells very nice. But I don’t take pills, or anything like that. I try to stay away from those things. They make me feel… strange. Just the cream, for my knees. And sometimes, a little something for a headache, but not often.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, occasional use of headache remedies and topical cream for knee pain. Now, let's briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Bad for the lungs, my wife says. Alcohol… sometimes, a little wine with dinner. On special occasions. Just a small glass, to celebrate. Recreational drugs? What are those? I make little models, Doctor. That is my recreation. Metal and plastic, very peaceful. A quiet life, mostly. I don't go out much. My wife likes to garden.
DOCTOR: So, minimal alcohol consumption, no smoking or drug use. Finally, before your wife brings in the records, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Family history. That is… difficult. I did not see my family much, growing up. Somalia was… a long time ago. My father… he was a shepherd, I think. Healthy man, very strong. My mother… she died when I was young. I don’t remember what she died from. No one talked about sickness much. Just… life. And then, coming here. New life. I don't know about heart disease, or… those things. My wife’s family, they are healthier, I think. She remembers everything. Maybe she can tell you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. It sounds like we'll rely heavily on your wife's information then. Perhaps she can join us when she arrives with the records. We'll need to review everything thoroughly before we can proceed. In the meantime, I'm going to conduct a brief physical exam to get a baseline assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good. A physical exam. Okay. I trust you. My wife says you are a very good doctor. I will… sit here. And wait for my wife. She is very organized. She will bring everything. And she will explain everything better. I forget so much these days. But I want this… baby. Very much.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat on the table, Mr. Carlotta. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. And please undress from the waist up. We'll keep it brief.
