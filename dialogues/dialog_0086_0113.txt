DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom business. Seems like I’m always going. Not… not sick, mind you. Just… frequently. It’s a nuisance, really. My wife keeps saying I drink too much tea, but I don’t see how that could be it. It’s just… more often than it used to be, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. And you don’t feel any pain or discomfort while you’re going?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just… the need to go, more and more. It’s not like it hurts, you understand. It’s just… bothersome. I used to be able to sit through a whole movie without a problem, now I’m up and down, up and down. And it’s not like I’m drinking gallons of the stuff! Honestly, these newfangled plumbing systems… maybe that’s the problem. Everything’s so sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to get a better understanding of this. First, can you give me a rough estimate of how many times a day you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me to count? I don't go around keeping tally, Doctor. It feels like… well, a lot. More than usual. Before, maybe… four, five times a day? Now… I don’t know… seven, eight? Maybe even more when I drink my tea. It's hard to say, honestly. I'm not one for keeping track of such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so definitely an increase from your usual four or five times. And you mentioned tea… how much tea would you say you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s a good brew, that tea. My wife gets it special. Let me think… I have a cup with breakfast, another mid-morning, one with lunch… then maybe two or three in the afternoon. And sometimes one with dinner, if I’m feeling it. It’s a good habit, you see. Keeps the blood flowing. Not those fancy herbal teas, mind you. Proper black tea, with a bit of milk.
DOCTOR: So, roughly five to seven cups of black tea a day. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, changes? It’s… yellow, Doctor. What color should it be? I haven’t been examining it too closely, if you want to know the truth. I go to the bathroom, do my business, and that’s that. I'm not a scientist! Though, now that you mention it, sometimes it seems a bit… darker than usual, maybe? But that could just be the light in the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay. Darker urine can be a sign of dehydration, which… could be linked to the tea. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Dehydration? From tea? That doesn't make any sense, Doctor. Tea is liquid! Look, I don't feel sick, alright? No fever, no chills, no aches. Just… needing to go. And I’m a bit tired, now that you mention it. But that’s just getting old, I suppose. It’s what happens when you reach my age. Everything starts to… slow down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, my wife’s cooking hasn’t changed. She still makes a lovely borscht, and her pierogi are always perfect. I eat what she puts in front of me, of course. Though, sometimes I don’t feel as hungry as I used to. But that’s just getting old, I tell you. Everything gets a little… less appealing when you’re my age. You don’t have the same zest for life, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now that you mention it… my wife did comment on my socks leaving a bit of a mark yesterday. But I always have a bit of a mark, don’t I? My feet aren’t what they used to be, you see. They’ve carried me a long way. Probably just the heat, too. It’s been awfully warm lately. Everything swells in this weather.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I think we need to do a quick physical exam and run some tests to rule out a few things. Frequent urination, especially with changes in appetite and some swelling, could indicate a few different issues. Nothing to panic about, but we need to investigate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, bother. I hate tests. All those poking and prodding. But… alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have some tomatoes that need tending to this afternoon. And my wife is expecting me to help with the laundry. But… yes. Do what you have to do. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. After that, I'd like to check your lower extremities for edema, and we’ll get a urine sample. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Edema? Is that something serious, Doctor? This is all sounding very… complicated. But… alright. Heart and lungs, abdomen, whatever. Just… try not to poke too hard. My ribs are a bit sensitive these days. And be quick about it, alright? Those tomatoes won’t tend themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just sit here for me. Take a few deep breaths for me, Mr. Segretto. Deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Good. Everything sounds… reasonably clear, but a little diminished. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness, Doctor. Just… a bit of a rumble. My stomach’s been a bit upset lately, to be honest. Probably all those pierogi my wife keeps making. Delicious, but… a bit rich, you know? And don’t press too hard, alright? I bruise easily these days. Everything’s a bit… delicate when you get to my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant tenderness, just a bit of… fullness. Now, let's take a look at your lower extremities. Do you notice any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, my wife mentioned something about my socks leaving a mark yesterday. And my shoes do feel a bit tighter than usual, now that you mention it. It's probably just the heat, though. Everything swells in this weather. But… yes, I suppose they are a bit puffy. Not terribly, mind you. Just… a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. I do see some mild edema in your lower extremities. Now, for the urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample. Just clean yourself up first, and then collect a sample mid-stream. Once you’re done, let me know, and I'll send it off to the lab.
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Another indignity. But alright. A mid-stream whatchamacallit. I remember those from… well, a long time ago. Just try to be discreet, alright? I don’t want the whole waiting room knowing my business. And… where is the restroom, exactly? It’s been a while since I’ve been in this clinic.
DOCTOR: It's right down that hallway, first door on the left. And don't worry, there's a lock on the door. I'll be right here when you get back. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A mid-stream… goodness. This is all very undignified, you know. But… thank you, Doctor. I’ll be back when I’m… finished.
