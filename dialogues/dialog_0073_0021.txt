DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. I’m Dr. Korrell. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Ricky Parascondola, pleased to meet ya. Well, it's this foot, see? It's been swellin’ up somethin’ awful. Started a few days back, and it's not gettin' better. Feels kinda warm too, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Swelling…and warm. A few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yep, about three, maybe four days now. It didn’t hurt at first, just felt…off. Now it’s a little achy, especially when I try to walk. I mostly been sittin' with it up, tryin' not to bother it. See? It's mostly around the ankle, but it’s goin’ up my foot a bit now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. And you haven't had any injury to the foot recently?
PATIENT: Nope, no injuries. Not that I remember, anyway. Didn’t twist it, didn’t drop nothin’ on it, nothin' like that. Just woke up one mornin’ and it was a bit puffy, and it’s just gotten worse since then. I been wearin’ these loose shoes, tryin' to give it room.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in the skin itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the skin…? Let me see… It looks… a little redder than usual, maybe? And it feels kinda warm to the touch, like I said. Not real hot, just… warmer than my other foot. I ain’t seen any cuts or blisters or anything like that, though. Just red and puffy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a closer look. Have you had any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor, not that I've noticed. I felt a little tired yesterday, but I figured it was just the heat. Been pretty warm lately, ya know? And no chills, no nothin' like that. I been drinkin' lots of water, tryin' to stay cool.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any pain in your calf?
PATIENT: Pain in my… calf? You mean here? Not really. Maybe a little bit sore when I stand up after sittin’ a while, but nothin’ major. Like a normal ache, ya know? It ain't keepin' me up at night or anything. Just this foot is the real problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to check your pulses in both feet. It’s a simple exam, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I always liked doctors that were thorough, makes a fella feel better knowin’ you're bein' looked after proper. This foot is really botherin’ me, so I appreciate ya takin’ the time.
DOCTOR: Okay… Your pulses are present in both feet, though the one on the affected side is a little weaker. Not dramatically so, but noticeable. I'm also going to check the range of motion in your ankle. Can you point your toes up and down for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Up…and down… It’s a little stiff, ya see? Doesn’t move as smooth as the other one. And it feels a bit…pinchy when I push it too far.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this foot been exposed to any cuts, scrapes, or insect bites recently?
PATIENT: Let me think... not that I recall. I wear sandals mostly, like I said. Been walkin’ around town a bit, doin’ my errands. Mighta stepped on somethin’ sharp, but I can't remember for sure. It’s been a few days, like everything else. I try to be careful, but ya never know. Coulda been a little somethin’ I didn’t feel.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Parascondola. Given the swelling, warmth, and slight weakness of the pulse, my preliminary concern is for a possible cellulitis or deep vein thrombosis. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing. I’m going to order a D-dimer blood test and a complete blood count. We’ll also need to rule out infection.
PATIENT: Woah, now hold on a minute, Doctor. Cellu-what-now? And deep vein… what? That sounds… serious. Is this somethin' really bad? And what's a D-di-mer? I ain't too good with all these medical words, ya see. I just want to know if it's gonna be alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola, let’s break it down. Cellulitis is a skin infection. Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in your leg. It can be serious, which is why we need to investigate. The D-dimer is a blood test that helps us rule out a clot. It's a simple blood draw, nothing to worry about. We need to be proactive, alright?
PATIENT: Proactive… yeah, I like that. Sounds sensible. So, a blood test will tell ya if there’s a clot, and another one to see if there’s an infection? Alright. That sounds… okay. Will the blood test tell me why my foot is swellin' up, though? Like, is it somethin' I did? Or somethin' I caught? And where do we do the blood draw?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us more information, but they won't necessarily pinpoint the cause. Several things could be contributing - a minor injury you don't recall, a small cut that became infected, or, as I mentioned, a blood clot. We'll have to consider all possibilities. The lab is just down the hall, room three. The nurse will take care of the blood draw. Based on your lack of insurance, it's likely you'll be responsible for the cost of the tests. Do you have the means to cover those expenses?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that’s not good. I don’t have a lot of money, Doctor. That's why I haven't been to a doctor in…well, a long time. I was hopin' to just get somethin' for the swellin', maybe a bandage or somethin'. I don't know what I'm gonna do about payin’ for tests. Is there… is there any way to get help with the cost? Or maybe a cheaper test? I really appreciate you lookin' at my foot, but I don't know if I can afford all this.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Parascondola, unfortunately, I can’t control the costs of the lab tests. There is a financial assistance program available through the hospital, but eligibility requirements are strict. I can have the nurse provide you with the application information. However, without these tests, I can’t provide you with an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. We can try some basic conservative measures – elevation, compression, and over-the-counter pain relievers – but without knowing the underlying cause, it’s just a temporary fix. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the application for financial assistance. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… thank you, Doctor. For lookin' at my foot, and for tellin' me about the tests…and the help with payin'. I'll talk to the nurse, then. I just hope it ain’t nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Mr. Parascondola. .
