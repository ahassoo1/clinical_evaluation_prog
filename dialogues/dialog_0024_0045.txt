DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes. Not all the time, you understand. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: “Sometimes.” Vague. And how long has this “sometimes” been occurring, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Oh. Hmm. Let me think… maybe six months, Doctor? Six months, I think. It started… around the time my wife… passed away. But I don’t know if it’s from that. It could be something else, right? I eat regular. Not much spice, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six months. And you attribute this… episode… to a recent bereavement. While emotional distress can manifest physically, we must rule out other possibilities. Can you describe when these flushing episodes occur?
PATIENT: When? That’s… a good question. It's not after exercise, definitely. And not when I’m cold. Sometimes when I talk to people… especially if I’m… explaining things. Or… if I feel a little embarrassed. Not always, you see. It just… happens. Like a hot wave. Then it goes away.
DOCTOR: So, primarily with social interaction, particularly when you are… animated, or experiencing what you perceive as embarrassment. Do you notice any other symptoms accompanying these flushing episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not like… pounding, but… aware of it, you know? And… maybe a little sweaty. Palms, mostly. But not always. It's… hard to say for sure. I don't pay much attention to those things unless they bother me. It’s the red face I don’t like. People stare, you see.
DOCTOR: Accelerated heart rate and diaphoresis… occasionally. Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medicines. Never been much for those. I try to stay natural, you understand? Just… tea, sometimes. Ginger tea for my stomach. That’s all. And vitamins. A multivitamin. Old age, you see. Need a little help.
DOCTOR: Ginger tea and a multivitamin. Right. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please have a seat on the examination table. I need to assess your blood pressure and heart rate while you are at rest. Then we’ll take a look at your complexion. Don’t fidget, please. It complicates matters.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. No problem. I'll try to be still. It's just… always felt a little strange, this whole thing. Being poked and prodded. But I understand. You need to see what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated – 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Skin is warm to the touch. There is some mild erythema, primarily across the cheeks and nose. No obvious lesions or rashes. Findings are… unremarkable, but not entirely dismissible. Have you ever been diagnosed with rosacea?
PATIENT: Ros-a-see-a? No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Never heard of it. I’ve had a few little spots sometimes, but I thought it was just… the sun. I used to work outside, you understand? Gardening. But that was a long time ago. Now I mostly stay indoors. Is that… bad? Is that what this is?
DOCTOR: It could be rosacea. It’s a common condition, particularly in individuals with fair skin, though it can present differently in various ethnicities. However, given your history and the associated symptoms – the flushing, the tachycardia, the diaphoresis – we cannot rule out other possibilities. I recommend a referral to a dermatologist for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. They have specialized equipment and experience in these matters. I will prepare a referral form for you now.
PATIENT: That… sounds good, Doctor. A specialist. Yes, that makes sense. I don’t want it to be anything serious, you understand? I just want to be able to… talk to people without my face turning red. Will they… do a lot of tests? I don’t like tests.
DOCTOR: The dermatologist will determine the necessary investigations. It may involve a skin biopsy, but it’s a relatively minor procedure. However, delaying diagnosis is not advisable. Here is the referral. The office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any further questions for me at this time, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For… looking at me. And for the referral. I hope it’s not too bad. I really don’t like going to doctors. But… I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I trust you will follow up with the dermatologist promptly. Good day, Mr. Withycombe. .
