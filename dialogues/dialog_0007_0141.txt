DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this…itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy. Not horribly crazy, but…uncomfortable. It doesn’t seem to be getting better, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching all over, for a few weeks now. That is frustrating. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not, like, a rash. There’s no bumps or anything, just…itchiness. It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. And it doesn’t seem to be connected to anything I’ve eaten or used. New soap, new laundry detergent…nothing like that. I’ve tried some lotions, but they don’t really help much. It just…is there. All over my arms, legs, back…even my scalp sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no visible rash, worse at night, doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything specific, and lotions haven't given much relief. It's all over – arms, legs, back, scalp… Got it. And just to clarify, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. Well, my wife, God rest her soul, passed away about six months ago. That was…a big change. Aside from that…no, not really. I haven’t started any new medications, haven’t traveled anywhere…I’ve mostly just been keeping to myself, honestly. Trying to get used to things. Does…does grief even cause something like this? I hadn't thought of that before.
DOCTOR: That is a significant change, Brendan, and you’re right to consider it. Grief can absolutely manifest physically in many ways. It's not uncommon. We’ll explore all possibilities, though. Just to be thorough, let’s run through some other things. Do you have any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me see. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss. My appetite's been a little off, but that's probably just from…everything. No changes in my bowel habits, no pain anywhere. Honestly, it's mostly just the itching. It doesn’t feel like…allergy itching, if that makes sense? Like, not hives or swelling, just…constant irritation. And it’s not like it’s one spot, it moves around. It'll be on my arms one minute, then my legs the next.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, fatigue, weight loss, no other systemic symptoms. Appetite's a little off, but likely related to the situation. Constant, moving irritation, not allergy-type itching. That's helpful. Now, do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. Other than that, nothing major. I’ve broken a bone or two in my life, but that’s about it. My wife, she had some issues with her heart, but…that’s not relevant to me, is it? I take a water pill for the blood pressure, and a little something for cholesterol. That's about it. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, cholesterol medication, and generally good health. That’s good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And…oh! I had a hernia repaired about fifteen years ago. Small thing, recovered fine. Nothing since then. I don't really like going to the doctor if I can avoid it, so I try to stay on top of things myself. Mostly just eat right and try to get some exercise when I can. It's harder now, being alone, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, hernia repair fifteen years ago. I understand not wanting to be at the doctor more than necessary. We'll try to make this quick and thorough. Now, just to cover all bases, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve taken plenty of different medications over the years, never had a reaction. And no food allergies, or allergies to animals, plants…nothing. My wife was the one with allergies, she had to be careful with pollen and dust mites. I always figured I was just lucky. I can eat anything, pretty much. Which is probably why I’ve gotten a little…rounder in my old age.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, no allergies. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Any history of skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, anything like that – in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a tricky one. My mother, she had…sensitive skin, I guess you could call it. Easily irritated. But I don't think it was anything serious, no proper diagnosis. My father, he was a pretty tough man, didn’t really complain about much of anything. And my wife’s family…I don’t know them very well, to be honest. They live back in Venezuela, and we didn’t see them very often. I don't recall anyone having specific skin problems, no. It’s a fairly…ordinary family, all things considered. Nothing remarkable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of skin conditions. That helps. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your social habits, just to get a complete picture. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife didn't approve, and I just never saw the point. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it. And I certainly don't use any…recreational drugs. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. I like my tea, my books, and my garden. That’s about it. I used to enjoy fishing, but it’s hard to get motivated to go alone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. So, to recap, you’ve had this all-over itching for a few weeks, it's worse at night, doesn't seem related to anything specific, no rash, no fever, fatigue, or weight loss. You have well-controlled hypertension, take medication for cholesterol, no allergies, and no significant family or social history that seems relevant. Now, Brendan, to get a better sense of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and hopefully find some relief. It's been…unsettling, to say the least. This itch…it just won't let me relax. So, yes, please, let's take a look. Where do you want me to start?
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds normal. Then, I’ll take a look at your skin – especially the areas where you’re feeling the most itch. I'll also check your lymph nodes, just to be thorough. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Please point to the areas where you’re feeling the most itch right now. I’m not seeing any visible rash, redness, or bumps. Skin appears normal in color and texture. No signs of hives or inflammation. Let me just palpate your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. So far, the exam isn't revealing any obvious cause for the itching. It could be a number of things. Do you have any recent lab work, like a complete blood count, done by your primary care doctor?
PATIENT: That’s good to know…or, well, not good that it’s not obvious, but good that you've checked thoroughly. No, I haven’t had any recent lab work done. I see Dr. Petrov, he’s good, but I mostly just go for check-ups and blood pressure medication refills. I didn’t think this itch warranted a trip to the lab, honestly. I figured it was something minor. I suppose we’re back to square one then? Is there anything else you can check? Maybe a…scan or something? I’m not sure what all my options are. I just want this to stop. It’s driving me crazy, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Brendan. You're right, the physical exam isn't giving us a clear answer. And you're not wrong to want to find the cause. Since the exam is normal, and you haven’t had recent lab work, I think it’s a good idea to start with some basic blood tests. We'll check your complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or inflammation, your liver and kidney function, and your thyroid levels – because thyroid problems can sometimes cause itching. I also want to rule out anything more serious, so I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel as well. It’s a pretty standard set of tests, and it should give us a good starting point. Would you be comfortable getting those tests done today?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…sensible. If it can rule things out, I’m all for it. Yes, let’s go ahead and get those tests done today. Where do I need to go? And how long will it take to get the results back? I have a…a bit of a routine, you see. I like to have my tea at a certain time, and I don’t like to disrupt it if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Of course. We have a lab right downstairs. I'll write you a requisition form with the tests I want done. It should take about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I'll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, to help relieve the itching, I recommend using a fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day. And avoid hot showers – lukewarm water is better. We can also discuss an over-the-counter antihistamine, but I’d like to see the lab results before recommending anything specific. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fragrance-free moisturizer, lukewarm showers…and wait for the results. It doesn't sound like a miracle cure, but it's something. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It's…nice to talk to someone who doesn't just dismiss it as "old age." Where do I go for the blood work? Just down the hall?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. It's my job to listen, and I want to get to the bottom of this for you. And you’re right, it’s never dismissive to address these concerns. Yes, the lab is just down the hall, to your left. The nurses there are very efficient. Just tell them you’re here for the blood work I ordered, and they’ll take care of you. After you've had the tests done, feel free to head home and relax. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results. If anything changes, or if the itching gets significantly worse before we get the results, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Brendan. And don't worry, we’ll figure this out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will. Have a good day to you as well.
