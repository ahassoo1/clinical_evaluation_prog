DOCTOR: Right, Lytisha Hughston. 51 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think. A drug test. Someone said I needed one. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I work with… machines, big ones, outside. That's all I really remember being told. It’s something to do with the job, I guess.
DOCTOR: Machines, right. Look, I deal with medical issues. A drug test isn’t really… my department. Is there a specific symptom you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: A symptom? Oh… no, not really. I feel fine, mostly. A little tired, maybe, but that’s just from the work, you know? Big machines are tiring! I don't feel sick or anything. Is this test… mandatory? I don't understand why I'm here if I'm not feeling poorly. It all seems a bit… confusing.
DOCTOR: Mandatory?
PATIENT: Well, that's what they said. Something about… safety regulations. I operate the paving equipment, and they said it was a requirement for the job. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to paperwork. My late husband always handled all that. He was very organized. I just… do the work. Do you need me to call someone to explain it better? I'm really not sure what's going on.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Hughston, I understand you’re feeling… overwhelmed. But frankly, coming to a doctor and expecting me to sort out your employment regulations isn’t a good use of either of our time. If it’s a work requirement, you should be speaking with HR. But… since you are here, and I’m required to at least ask… any other medical concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, HR… right. Yes, they said something about that. Medical concerns… hmm. Well, my knees ache sometimes, especially after a long day. And I get a little breathless when I climb the stairs, but that's probably just my age, isn't it? Nothing a good night’s sleep doesn't fix, usually. Honestly, I’m not sure what is a medical concern anymore. It’s just… getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Knees and stairs. Right. Well, let's just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. It's probably nothing, but we have to document something since you're here. Sit back, please. And try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds… sensible. I’ll try to breathe normally. It’s just… it feels a bit silly, getting checked when I feel alright. But if you think it’s best…
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are… regular, though a little faint. Lungs are clear, but I hear some… diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Any history of smoking?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… he smoked a bit, years ago, but I always made him go outside. He had a terrible cough sometimes. But I never smoked. No, never. It’s bad for you, you know? Is that… is that why you’re asking? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, it's just a standard question. Diminished breath sounds can be… many things. How about your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my weight… Well, I used to be lighter, but… not so much anymore. I think around 138 pounds? It fluctuates a bit, to be honest. It's hard to keep track. I haven't weighed myself regularly since… well, since my husband passed away. He always encouraged me to.
DOCTOR: 138 pounds, alright. And your height?
PATIENT: Oh, my height… that’s an easy one. I’m very tall, always have been. Around 197 centimeters, I think. Yes, 197. It’s why I always stood at the back of photos. I used to play basketball, you know. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your age, height, and weight, and the diminished breath sounds… it could be early signs of… well, it’s probably nothing. But we should get a chest X-ray just to be safe. I’ll write you a referral. And I strongly suggest you discuss this with HR about the drug test. I’m not equipped to handle that.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Oh dear. Is it… serious? I don’t like X-rays. Too much… radiation, isn't it? And I really didn't come here for this. I just needed the test for my job. Is it possible… could it be the machines? All that dust and vibration… it’s very rough work, you know.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Hughston, I'm not going to speculate about your paving equipment. Dust and vibration are rarely the cause of diminished breath sounds. An X-ray is a simple procedure, and it's better to rule things out. I’m not dismissing your concerns, but I am concerned about these findings. This isn’t a matter of speculation; it’s a medical precaution. I'll write the referral, and you can discuss your concerns with the radiology technician. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that sounds… sensible, I suppose. Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. Nothing serious. And I can't think of anything else… not really. No, I don't have any allergies, to the best of my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the referral for the chest X-ray. Make an appointment as soon as possible. And again, please address your concerns about the drug test with HR. I’ve documented my findings. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you. I suppose not. Just… the X-ray… it sounds a bit frightening. But if you think it’s best… No, I don't think there’s anything else. Thank you for your time. I’ll try to get an appointment soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mrs. Hughston. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions… about the X-ray. .
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Thank you. You too. .
