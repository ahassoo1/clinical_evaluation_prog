DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It's…well, it's not a serious problem, you understand. Just thought I’d get a little something from the doctor. A card, really. You know, a “Get Well” card or something encouraging. My daughter, she thinks I worry too much. Honestly, she just doesn’t understand how things are.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see. So, you're hoping for a medical note to reassure your daughter?
PATIENT: Reassure? No, no. Not reassure. A card! A nice card from you, the doctor. It would mean something coming from a professional, wouldn’t it? She listens to everyone but me. A little piece of paper with your name on it… that’s all I need. It's silly, I know, but… well. She thinks I'm imagining things.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand your daughter is concerned about your worries. However, as a physician, my role is to address your health concerns medically. I can't ethically provide a note simply to validate feelings without a medical basis. Perhaps we could discuss what concerns you are having, and I can assess if there's anything I can address from a medical perspective?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re being difficult. Medical basis? It’s common sense! I just… I feel things. I know my body. And my daughter thinks I’m making it all up. Honestly, young people these days… no respect for their elders. It's not about having a problem, it’s about her believing me when I say I feel unwell! A card would prove I’m not just…old and silly. It’s a simple request! Are you refusing to write a card for a patient? That doesn’t sound very professional at all.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I apologize if I'm not meeting your expectations. I want to help you, and I am a professional. But writing a note stating you feel unwell without understanding what you're feeling unwell from goes against medical ethics. It doesn’t help you get the care you deserve, and it could even be harmful. Let’s try a different approach. Can you tell me specifically what’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Everything! My joints ache, sometimes. And I get these…feelings. Like a heaviness in my chest, not always, but enough to worry me. And my sleep… it’s not right. I wake up feeling tired, even after eight hours. It’s just…a general unwellness. But she just says it's old age! Says I need to get more exercise. Exercise! As if I haven't tried that. It's a waste of time explaining it to her, really. You’re a doctor, you should just… write something saying I’m not imagining things. A simple “Janeth Micucci is experiencing symptoms and is under medical evaluation” would be perfect. Is that so difficult?
DOCTOR: Okay, so joint pain, feelings of heaviness in your chest, and disrupted sleep. Those are things we can explore. And I understand your frustration with your daughter. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the chest heaviness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a pain, exactly. It’s more like… a weight. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It happens mostly when I’m stressed, you know? When my daughter starts… explaining things to me. It makes it hard to breathe, sometimes. Not like I’m gasping for air, but… uncomfortable. It just feels… tight. And then the tiredness sets in. Honestly, it’s exhausting just talking about it. She thinks I’m being dramatic. “Mom, you’re fine,” she says. “You just need to relax.” Relax! As if I haven’t tried that too. It’s just… a lot. Do you write cards to patients who are stressed? Maybe that would be enough for her.
DOCTOR: Janeth, that heaviness in your chest, especially when you’re stressed, is something we need to take seriously. While it could be related to anxiety, chest discomfort should always be evaluated to rule out any potential heart-related issues. Have you ever had this checked out before?
PATIENT: Checked out? No. Why would I? It comes and goes. It’s just… my nerves. My mother had nerves, you know? She worried about everything. Always. And her heart was fine. Perfectly fine, right up until the end. So it's probably just… hereditary nerves. Honestly, I don’t want a lot of tests. They make me anxious. And my daughter will say “I told you so” if everything comes back normal. It’s just… a lot of fuss for nothing. I really just want a card. A simple card saying I’m under your care. That’s all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand you’re hesitant about tests and worried about upsetting your daughter. However, as your doctor, I have a responsibility to ensure your safety. Chest discomfort can be a symptom of serious conditions, and it's important to rule those out. I'm not suggesting anything drastic, just a basic EKG and perhaps a blood test to check your heart enzymes. I still can’t ethically write a card simply to validate your feelings. But I can discuss your symptoms with you thoroughly, document everything in your medical record, and explain the results of any tests we do. That documentation might be helpful to show your daughter. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But no fuss. And nothing complicated. Just the quick tests. And you have to promise you’ll explain everything clearly. No medical jargon, you hear? And I still think a card would be more helpful. Honestly, doctors these days… so focused on the tests and not focused on the patient. But fine. Do your tests. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if everything is normal, I want you to remember I told you so. It’s a waste of time, honestly. A complete waste of time. But fine. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. I promise to keep things as simple as possible and explain everything clearly, no medical jargon. We'll start with an EKG – it’s a quick and painless test that checks your heart’s electrical activity. Then we'll do a simple blood draw. We'll get the results as quickly as possible, and I'll go over them with you in detail. Let’s get started with the EKG. I’ll have the nurse come in to set you up.
PATIENT: Fine. But if it takes all day, I’m holding you responsible. And don't expect me to be cheerful about it. Honestly, this is all just… a lot. I really just wanted a card. A simple card. Is that too much to ask from a doctor?
