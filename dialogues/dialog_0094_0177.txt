DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. My name is Dr. Ka Gegan. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Gegan, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s...down there. Something’s leaking. Not good. It’s been a few days now, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things these days. It's just...uncomfortable. And smells a little funny. Not like flowers, for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Jimmi. It sounds concerning, and we'll definitely get to the bottom of it. When you say "down there," are you referring to your vaginal area?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Oh, no, no, no. Not me. It’s… him. My friend. He’s the one with the problem. We... spend time together. A lot of time. And now he’s leaking. Honestly, young people these days... no respect for hygiene.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, your friend is experiencing leakage, and it's been happening for a few days. And you mentioned it has an odor. Can you describe the leakage a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like water, if that makes sense. It's… thicker. And kinda yellowish, I think. Hard to see properly, you know? And it stains his clothes. Not a good look for him. He tries to keep it clean, bless his heart, but he's not the neatest. Honestly, I shouldn't have to tell you these things... it's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your embarrassment, Jimmi, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable discussing these things, and you’re doing the right thing by seeking medical attention for your friend. Thicker and yellowish discharge is definitely something we need to investigate. Does your friend have any pain, burning, or itching associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmmm. He doesn’t say anything. He's a quiet one, mostly. I think he just… grumbles a little when he gets up sometimes. And I haven't noticed any itching. Mostly just the smell, and the mess. He's getting on in years, you know? Things just… wear out. Like an old car.
DOCTOR: Okay, no reported pain or itching, just some grumbling when he gets up and the discharge with an odor. Has he had anything like this happen before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... years and years ago, maybe? When he was with that woman… the one with the bright red lipstick. Yes, I remember her complaining about something similar. A doctor came to the house then, I think. Gave him some pills. But I can't remember what they were for. Old age, you know? The memory goes. It wasn’t this bad then, though.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jimmi. It’s helpful to know he’s had a similar issue in the past. Any recollection of how long that episode lasted or what the doctor said about it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, not a bit. Just that there was a lot of fuss. She was a dramatic one, that woman. Always complaining. I think it lasted a few weeks, maybe? Honestly, I mostly remember being annoyed with all the noise. He’s a good man, my friend, but he does attract trouble. And she certainly made a lot of it. I don’t want to bother you with stories about her, though.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Jimmi, you're not bothering me at all. It's helpful to get a complete picture. So, a few weeks in the past with a similar issue, treated with pills. Now, just to be thorough, has your friend been experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, he doesn’t get sick much. He’s a strong one, my friend. Though he does sleep a lot these days. And chills… no, it’s been pretty warm lately. Abdominal pain… well, he complains about his back sometimes, but that's just old age, I reckon. He used to be a fisherman, you know. Hard work. All that bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or abdominal pain, just some back discomfort from his previous work as a fisherman. Now, has your friend had any recent changes in his urination – any burning, increased frequency, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Urination…? Oh, goodness. I don't… I don't pay attention to those things, Doctor. Really. He goes to the bathroom, of course. We all do. I haven’t noticed anything different. Honestly, it’s rude to ask such personal questions!
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel personal, Jimmi. It’s important for me to gather all the necessary information to understand what’s going on with your friend and ensure he receives the best possible care. Given the yellowish discharge and his age, it's important to rule out a possible infection. I'd like to ask your friend a few questions directly if that's alright, and then I'd like to perform a gentle physical examination. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. Examination…? Well, I suppose if it has to be done. He’s a bit shy, my friend. Doesn’t like doctors much. But he trusts me. I’ll have to explain it all to him first. And you must be gentle, mind you. He's a sensitive soul.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. I understand he’s shy, and I will explain everything to him beforehand. I’ll need to ask him about any other symptoms he might be experiencing, like any pain in his groin or testicles, and about his sexual history. I will also need to examine his genitals to look for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. Before we call him in, I want to review his past medical history, if available. Do you know if he’s seen a doctor recently, or have any records of his previous illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Records? No, not a bit. He’s not one for doctors, remember? He mostly just takes a few aspirin when he feels a bit creaky. And a bit of tonic water for his legs. But that’s it. He says doctors just poke and prod and don’t listen. Honestly, I think he's a bit stubborn. And very private. This whole thing is very upsetting, you know. It's not like him to be… unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jimmi. It sounds like he prefers to manage things on his own. That’s alright. Given his lack of medical history, it's even more important that we get a thorough understanding of his current symptoms. Alright. Let's call him in, and we'll take it slowly. I'll do my best to make him feel comfortable. We can start by simply talking to him and getting a better understanding of what he's been experiencing. Would you like to be present during the examination?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. I must be there. He’ll be too embarrassed otherwise. And I can explain things to him if he doesn’t understand. Honestly, he's a bit simple sometimes. But a good man, my friend. A very good man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jimmi. I'm happy you’ll be there to support him. Let’s get him settled in. Could you please call in your friend when you’re ready?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just a moment. I’ll go get him. He's in the waiting room, reading an old newspaper. Honestly, he doesn't understand half of what's in those things. .
