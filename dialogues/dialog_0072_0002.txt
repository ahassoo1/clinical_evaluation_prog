DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Hembrey, you say? It's nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, it's… going to the bathroom. It's a bit hard now, you see. Not like it used to be. It takes a while, and… I don't always feel like I get everything out, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty with urination and a feeling of incomplete emptying. That’s a reasonable concern, Ms. Stoffregen. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… when did it start? That’s a good question. Everything feels a bit… blurry these days. I think… maybe a few months ago? Or was it longer? I really can't say for sure. It wasn’t sudden, that I know. Just… got harder and harder over time, I guess. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. “Gradual onset” is useful information. And can you describe the stream itself?
PATIENT: The… stream? Oh. Well, it’s not as strong as it used to be, that’s for sure! Used to be, I could… well, never you mind about that. But now, it’s… weaker. And it takes a bit of… pushing, sometimes. Not always, but often enough to notice. Does that make sense? It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. These things are common, and it’s important to discuss them so we can determine the cause. So, a weaker stream, requiring straining at times. Do you experience any pain or burning during urination?
PATIENT: Pain…? Hmm. Not really pain, no. It’s not a sharp pain, if that makes any sense. More like… a little discomfort. A sort of… ache, afterwards, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. And it’s not awful, just… noticeable. Burning… no, I don't think so. No burning. Just… the ache, now and then. Is that important?
DOCTOR: The discomfort and occasional ache are relevant, yes. Now, are you experiencing any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or is it a steady flow once you begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Starting it… that’s a tricky one. Sometimes it starts right away, no problem at all. Other times… I have to wait a little bit. Just… stand there for a moment, you know? And then it will start. It’s not like it won't start at all, just… takes a moment. Not every time, though. Mostly when I'm really needing to go, I think. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stoffregen, that’s quite clear. Intermittent difficulty initiating the stream, more pronounced with urgency. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently – constipation, diarrhea, or anything unusual?
PATIENT: Oh dear… bowel habits? Well… now that you mention it… things haven’t been quite regular, lately. A little… stuck, sometimes. Not bad, mind you. I take a little something for it now and then. Nothing major. And no… no diarrhea or anything like that. Just a little… slow going, if you know what I mean. I think getting old makes everything slow going! Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Stoffregen. Constipation can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms. Do you have any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just from the weather, I think. And no chills. And… no, no lower abdominal pain. Nothing like that. Just… the discomfort after going to the bathroom, and the little bit of trouble starting sometimes. And being a bit… stuck, now and then. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a little tired just talking about all this!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for answering my questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle examination of your lower abdomen. We may also need to do a simple urine test to check for any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an examination? Well… I suppose so. I haven't had one in a long time, but… if you think it’s necessary. I just… don't like being poked and prodded, if you know what I mean. And a urine test… that sounds alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… will it be painful, Doctor? I don’t want to be in pain.
DOCTOR: No, the examination and urine test should not be painful, Ms. Stoffregen. The abdominal exam is gentle, and the urine test is a simple collection. I will explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you are uncomfortable. If you would like, you may change into a gown. I’ll step out while you do so, and I’ll be right back when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A gown… Well, I suppose it’s necessary. I haven’t worn one of these in ages. It’s a little chilly in here, you know. Alright then. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll just change. And you call me when you're ready.
