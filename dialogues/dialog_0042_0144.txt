DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Lovely clinic you have here… very…rustic. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My daughter insisted. Said I should get “checked out.” Something about being my age, you know? I feel fine, mostly. Just the usual aches and pains. I suppose she worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s wonderful your daughter is so attentive to your health. It’s always good to have someone looking out for us. “Checked out” can mean a lot of things, and it's smart to be proactive. So, let’s start with those “usual aches and pains.” Could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just…here and there. My knees bother me when it rains, always have. And my back…well, I used to be a surgical tech, you know. Lots of bending and lifting. It's probably just that. Old injuries, I suppose. I don't really complain about it, though. You get used to things. Honestly, I’m not sure what you want to know about it. Is there a specific question? It’s all just…old age.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what’s bothering us. It’s good you’ve been managing, and it's helpful to know what you haven't been experiencing as well. You mentioned your knees bother you when it rains, and you used to work as a surgical tech. Has the back pain been getting worse recently, or is it pretty stable?
PATIENT: Stable, I think. It flares up if I try to do too much gardening, maybe. My daughter keeps telling me to hire someone, but I like my garden. It's… therapeutic. Honestly, I don’t recall it being worse than usual lately. It just…is. Like a familiar friend, almost. Do I need to take off my shoes? It feels a bit silly talking about aches and pains…it’s not like anything is broken.
DOCTOR: I understand. A familiar friend is a good way to put it. And no, you don’t need to take off your shoes just yet. We can do a quick examination if you’re comfortable, just to get a better sense of things. It sounds like you're very active, and that's wonderful. Before we do that, though, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm…let me think. Well, my memory isn't what it used to be, that's for sure. But whose is at my age? I forget names sometimes, and where I put things. Nothing major. My daughter keeps pointing out things, like I left the stove on…but I don’t think I did! She worries too much. I’m perfectly capable, thank you very much. I still cook all my own meals, you know. Korean food, mostly. It's very healthy.
DOCTOR: It's very common to experience some changes in memory as we get older, and it sounds like you’re still very sharp and independent, which is fantastic. It's good you're still enjoying cooking and staying active. Just to be thorough, has anyone mentioned any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Sleep…well, I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to. I wake up a few times during the night. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? And my appetite…it comes and goes. Sometimes I’m ravenous, sometimes I just pick at things. Nothing alarming. I eat when I’m hungry, you know? I used to be a very picky eater, but now I enjoy everything! Except liver. I still can’t stand liver. My energy…it’s alright. I tire easily, but who doesn’t at my age? Honestly, I feel like you’re asking a lot of questions about things that are just…normal. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions, Ms. Calvery. I just want to get a complete picture of your overall health. It’s good you’re aware of these changes and can describe them so well. It is normal to experience these things with age, and you're right to point that out. Before we move on to a quick physical exam, let's just touch on your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… let me think. Well, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And…arthritis, I suppose. But that's hardly a surprise, given my work and my age. Oh, and high blood pressure, I think. I used to take pills for it, but the doctor said it was okay to stop. Something about my kidneys… I really don't remember the details. My daughter handles all that now. She's very organized. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's very common to not remember all the details, and it’s good you have your daughter to help with things. Knowing you’ve had your gallbladder removed, arthritis, and previously high blood pressure is helpful. We’ll definitely look into the details of your blood pressure and kidney function. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just these. The doctor recommended the fish oil for my…brain, I think. And I take these every day, just to stay healthy. Nothing else, really. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, if they’re really bothering me. But that's it. Honestly, I don't like taking a lot of pills. They make me feel…sluggish.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Multi-vitamins, fish oil, and ibuprofen as needed. It's good you're mindful of what you're taking. Now, one last quick thing before we move to the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky, actually. Never had any trouble with food or anything. Maybe a little sniffly when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's just seasonal. Nothing serious. Honestly, I think I’m allergic to dust, maybe. But who isn’t? No, I don’t think I have any real allergies. Are we almost done? This chair isn’t very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery, that’s very helpful. No known allergies. We're almost done with the questions. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees and back. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Get it over with then. Honestly, I don’t see what good it will do, but… But be gentle, dear. My back is sensitive. And try not to take too long, will you? I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not critically high. There's some mild tenderness on the inner side of both knees. No significant swelling. There's some muscle tightness in your lower back, and mild tenderness when I press here. Okay, Ms. Calvery, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, but we will want to investigate the elevated blood pressure a bit further.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure…just like my doctor always said. Honestly, I never worried much about it. It’s probably just stress. Or the weather. So, what does that mean? Do I need pills? I really don’t want to take pills. And what about my back? Is it serious? I need to be able to garden, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good you've been monitoring your blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure can be caused by a number of things, and it’s good we’re addressing it now. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need pills immediately. We’ll start with some lifestyle modifications – things like diet, exercise, and stress management. I can give you some resources on those. As for your back, it doesn’t seem serious. It’s likely muscle tightness from gardening and previous work. We can try some gentle stretching exercises and over-the-counter pain relief if needed. However, given your age and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a few blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for your blood pressure. I also recommend a kidney function test to see if that might be contributing to things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… honestly, I hate needles. But if you think it’s necessary… Fine. But make it quick, will you? And don’t poke me too much. And what about my garden? Will this affect my gardening? I need to know if I can still tend to my roses. They’re my pride and joy.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about needles, Ms. Calvery. We'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood tests are relatively simple, and it won’t take long. As for your garden, the blood tests shouldn’t affect your ability to garden at all. We just want to get a better understanding of your overall health so we can make sure you can continue enjoying your roses for many years to come. I'll write you a lab order. You can go to the lab at [Name of local lab] on [Address of local lab]. They're open [Lab hours]. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to manage your blood pressure and keep you gardening happily. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. [Name of local lab]… I think I’ve heard of it. So, just go there, get poked, and then come back? Honestly, it’s a lot of fuss over nothing, probably. But if you think it’s necessary… I’ll go. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And make sure they have comfortable chairs in that lab. Now, can I go? My roses are waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right. Just go to [Name of local lab], they will draw some blood, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. I'll make a note to recommend they ensure comfortable chairs in the waiting room. Here's the lab order, and a handout with information on lifestyle modifications for blood pressure management. You can go at your own pace, Ms. Calvery. And don't worry, we’ll take good care of you. Please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment once you've had the blood tests done. It was lovely meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you again. And please, enjoy your roses!
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Thank you, dear. Enjoy your day. And try not to poke too many people.
