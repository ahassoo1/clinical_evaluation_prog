DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be… going to the bathroom rather a lot, more than usual. It's been happening for a little while now, I believe. Though, to be honest, time does seem to slip away these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination, you said. And how long has this “little while” been, if you can estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I suppose… several weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to be certain. I’ve not been keeping a strict tally, you understand. It's just… noticeable. More trips during the day, and… well, a couple of times at night too, which is new. I don't recall that happening before.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is there any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, Doctor. Not that I’ve noticed. It’s… just the volume, and the frequency. It doesn't hurt, thankfully. Just… inconvenient. And a bit concerning, naturally. Is this something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: Right. No pain is good. Are you experiencing any increased thirst, or have you noticed a change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Increased thirst… You know, now that you mention it, perhaps a little. I have been reaching for water more often, yes. Not dramatically, but… more than I usually do. As for appetite… no, I don't think so. I eat… reasonably well, I suppose. Nothing particularly different. Mostly just… standard fare. I haven't been terribly hungry lately, but that could be the weather, perhaps? It’s been rather warm, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Changes in… my stool? Well, that’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? No, not that I've observed. Everything seems… regular in that regard. I apologize, Doctor, but I'm not one for dwelling on such things. Is it important? Perhaps it’s unrelated to… the bathroom situation?
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in bowel habits. Let’s move on. Do you have any history of diabetes or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… I believe my mother had something similar, later in life. But I don’t recall ever being told I do. Prostate… Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. I don’t believe so, no. I haven't had any specific treatments or been told about any problems in that area. Things have… simply worked, as far as I know. I’m not very good with medical details, I'm afraid. The doctors always seemed to handle it.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just the usual, I suppose. A small dose of something for my blood pressure, I think. The doctor prescribed it some time ago. And… allergies… Hmm. I do recall a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin when I was a boy, but that was decades ago. Apart from that, no, nothing significant that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any trouble with medications recently, thankfully. Do you need the name of the blood pressure medication? I believe it’s at home.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get the name later. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need to check your abdomen, and I’d also like to do a digital rectal exam. It’s important to rule out any potential issues.
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh dear. Is that… absolutely necessary, Doctor? It sounds… rather intrusive. I understand you’re the professional, of course, but… is there no other way? Perhaps a blood test? I'm not entirely comfortable with that, if you don’t mind me saying so. I’ve never had one before. I… I suppose if you insist, but could you explain a bit more about why it’s needed?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbose, I understand your hesitation. A digital rectal exam allows me to physically assess the prostate gland, and check for any enlargement or abnormalities. It's a quick procedure, though not the most comfortable, and helps rule out a common cause of frequent urination, particularly in men your age. A blood test can give us some information, but it won't give us a complete picture. It's important to be thorough. If you absolutely prefer, we can start with a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar, and then revisit the exam if necessary. However, I strongly recommend completing the exam for a more accurate assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… rather a lot to take in. A blood test… yes, that sounds… preferable. Starting with that would certainly be easier, I think. Then… then we can see. If the blood test is normal, is it possible we could avoid… the other test? I’m not certain I could… cope with it, Doctor. I simply haven’t had much experience with medical procedures. I appreciate your understanding. Let’s start with the blood test, please. I trust that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbose. A blood test it is. We'll get that ordered right away. It will give us a good starting point. And we can discuss the results and potential next steps afterwards. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood. It’s a standard procedure, and shouldn’t take long. In the meantime, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. Social history… well, I live alone, I'm afraid. Never married. Always focused on my work, you see. Environmental engineering isn't a terribly social profession, though quite rewarding. I enjoy reading, mostly historical novels, and… a bit of gardening when the weather permits. I don't drink very much, a glass of wine with dinner perhaps, and I haven’t smoked in decades. Quite a quiet life, really. I do have a few acquaintances from the university, but we don’t see each other very often. It's… sufficient. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you travel frequently?
PATIENT: Travel? Oh, no, not at all. I haven't been on a proper holiday in… well, decades, I believe. Work kept me rather busy, you see. A few conferences, mostly within Europe, but nothing exciting. I prefer to stay close to home, really. Comfortable surroundings, you understand. I haven't much of a desire to explore distant lands. It’s just as well, I suppose. All that flying… rather stressful, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Right. And are there any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Sleep patterns… Hmm. Well, as I mentioned earlier, I have been getting up a bit more often during the night, due to… the bathroom visits. So, perhaps a little disrupted. But generally, I sleep reasonably well. I don't suffer from insomnia, or anything of that nature. I usually retire around ten o'clock, and wake up around seven. Though, I do seem to wake up feeling a bit… fatigued lately, perhaps due to the interruptions. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, any recent weight changes?
PATIENT: Weight changes… no, not that I'm aware of. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, I'm afraid. I’ve probably lost a little weight, now that I think about it. My clothes feel… a bit looser, perhaps. But nothing significant, certainly not intentional. It could be the stress, or… simply getting older. It happens to the best of us, I suppose. Is that all, Doctor? I’m starting to feel rather tired now. Perhaps we could discuss the blood test results soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbose. That’s all for now. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood, and we'll get those results back to you as quickly as possible. We’ll review them, and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and patience. I appreciate your understanding, especially regarding… everything. I shall contact the clinic if anything changes. Thank you again.
