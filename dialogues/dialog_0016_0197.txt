DOCTOR: Good morning, San. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? This whole ride-share thing… I need the card to drive, you know? Just trying to keep busy after… well, never mind. It's for a commercial driver medical card, right? I just want to make sure I can still do it. I’m 70, so figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely! A commercial driver medical card – that’s exactly what we can help with. It’s very smart of you to get things checked out, especially with a change like this. We want to make sure you're safe and able to drive comfortably and legally. Okay, so just to confirm, you’re here for a DOT physical?
PATIENT: DOT physical… is that the official name for it? Yes, that sounds right. Whatever I need to get so I can drive people around. I mostly just do little trips, you know, airport runs and things. Nothing long haul. But they require the card, and I don't want any trouble with the law.
DOCTOR: Yes, a DOT physical is the official one required for commercial driving. Good, that's a very responsible attitude to take. Okay, so you're 70 years old, and wanting to maintain your ability to drive for ride-sharing, mostly airport runs and shorter trips. Before we get started with the exam, let's just go over a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Ito, over on Elm Street. I see her twice a year, regular checkups. Blood pressure's been a little high sometimes, but she's got it under control with a little pill. Other than that… honestly, not much. I try to stay active, walk every day. She’ll tell you that much, at least. Do you need her number or anything?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you’re under regular care with Dr. Ito and keeping up with your health. It's helpful to have that information. No, I don’t need her number right now, but if I had any questions I might reach out. So, you mentioned blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications for that, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. It's Lisinopril, I think. Little white pill. One every morning. And… oh! Sometimes I take Tylenol for my knees. They bother me if it rains, or if I walk too much. That's it, though. Promise. I don't like taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and Tylenol as needed for your knees. Good to know. “Foggy” is a good way to describe that feeling sometimes. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, not that I know of. I eat everything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She was right, mostly. Never had a reaction to anything. I've had stitches a couple of times, you know, falling as a kid… but no allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! No known allergies is very good to hear. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit more broadly. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything serious?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really serious. When I was younger, maybe 40, I had my gallbladder out. That was a couple of days in the hospital, but it was a long time ago. Other than that… a broken arm when I was a child, but that was just an overnight stay. Nothing major in recent years, thankfully. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal when you were around 40, and a broken arm as a child. That’s helpful to know. And in terms of family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had diabetes, later in life. And her mother had heart trouble. My father, he was healthy as a horse, always walking. But my brother, he had high cholesterol, had to watch his diet. That's about it, really. Nothing too scary. I always figured I got lucky with the good genes from my father. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in her mother, and high cholesterol in your brother. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I try to eat pretty healthy, lots of vegetables. Not much fast food, honestly. I walk about a mile every day, rain or shine. Keeps me moving. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but I cut back on that a couple of years ago. Trying to be good! Mostly just quiet these days, you know? Reading, gardening… keeping busy. It’s a simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very good! Healthy diet, regular exercise, no smoking… those are all excellent habits. Okay, San, that gives me a really good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of your overall health and make sure you meet the DOT requirements. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just want to get this card so I can keep driving. Let's get it over with, eh? I don’t want to waste anyone's time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Alright, let’s start with your vision. Could you please read this eye chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Okay… um… is that an E? Then… F… P… T… O… Yeah, I think that’s right. I used to have perfect vision, but it’s not what it used to be. Do I need glasses to drive? I’ve been putting it off, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, your vision is a bit blurry, but within acceptable limits for driving with correction. It looks like you could benefit from an updated glasses prescription, and we'll note that as a recommendation. It's good you’re aware of it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… another deep breath… and out… Everything sounds clear and regular. No murmurs or wheezing. Good. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that's fine. Not really. Maybe a little… if you push right there? But nothing major. Just a little discomfort. I get a little bloated sometimes, but that’s all. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a little tenderness there as well. It could be a bit of gas, or perhaps some mild constipation. It’s not concerning at this point, but we'll make a note of it. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Good, good reflexes there. And I’ll just check your feet. Those are also normal. Your pulse is strong and regular in all four limbs. Good circulation. Alright, San. That completes the physical exam. Everything looks pretty good overall. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, but within a manageable range given your medication.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s a relief. So… am I good to go? Can I get the card? I really need to get back, you know. I have a few airport runs booked for tomorrow morning. I promised people I'd be there. 140/90… is that bad? Should I tell Dr. Ito?
DOCTOR: Yes, 140/90 is a bit elevated, and it’s good you ask. While it's not immediately dangerous, it's something we should discuss with Dr. Ito to ensure your blood pressure is optimally controlled. I’ll send her a copy of the results and my recommendations. Now, regarding the DOT card… you do meet the basic requirements, but because of your slightly elevated blood pressure, I'm going to recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician to get it under better control before issuing the full card. You can still drive in the meantime, but I would need documentation from Dr. Ito stating you are cleared to drive commercially. I understand you have bookings tomorrow, and I don’t want to disrupt your schedule unnecessarily, but safety is our top priority. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly… that's just great. More waiting. More appointments. I just want to get back to work, you know? But… I guess safety is important. And Dr. Ito… she’ll probably want me to take another pill or something. Okay, fine. I’ll talk to Dr. Ito. Can you… send her something tonight? So I can get an appointment scheduled quickly? And… what do I tell the people who booked me? I can’t just cancel on them. This is a mess.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I'll fax a summary of the exam results, including my recommendation for blood pressure control, to Dr. Ito’s office immediately. I can also include a note explaining the situation, so she understands the urgency. Regarding your bookings, you can explain that you’re awaiting medical clearance to ensure you’re operating safely and legally. Most people will understand. And you can let them know you'll update them as soon as you have more information. Here's a copy of the results for your records. It includes Dr. Ito’s fax number and my contact information should she have any questions. We want to get you back on the road as soon as possible, San, and ensuring your blood pressure is under control is the best way to do that. Once we have clearance from Dr. Ito, we can issue the card without any further delay. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment with you here in a week to discuss the results and any changes to your medication?
PATIENT: A week… that’s better than nothing, I suppose. Yes, schedule something. Next Tuesday, maybe? If that works. I just… I really need this card. I'm not getting any younger, you know? And I like keeping busy. It’s good for the soul. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… trying to understand. And for sending the information to Dr. Ito. I'll call her first thing in the morning. Hopefully, she can squeeze me in quickly. Okay. I guess that’s all then. Thank you again. Stop bothering you now. I hope to see you again next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. We’ll get you scheduled for next Tuesday, and I’m optimistic Dr. Ito can work you in. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Keeping busy is definitely good for the soul! Take care, and drive safely in the meantime.
