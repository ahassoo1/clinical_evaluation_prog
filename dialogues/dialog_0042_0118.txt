DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Vodzak, you say? A… Bulgarian name, isn’t it? Yes, well. I believe it’s for a… certification, of some sort. My previous employer insisted upon it. Honestly, the whole thing feels rather unnecessary, but one must comply, I suppose. It has to do with my… hearing, or perhaps my vision. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Yes, Vodzak is Bulgarian. And thank you for clarifying. A certification… related to hearing or vision, you said?
PATIENT: Precisely. Or at least, I think it is. It was something to do with maintaining… competence. For my profession, you understand. Healthcare… something or other. It’s all quite administrative, really. I’ve been doing this for decades, I assure you, I am perfectly competent. Are we to begin the… assessment, then?
DOCTOR: We are, yes. And I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Oriley. Sometimes these requirements can feel a bit redundant when you have a long and successful career. But let’s just go through a few standard tests to satisfy the certification requirements, shall we?
PATIENT: Standard tests, you say? Very well. Though I must warn you, my schedule is rather… demanding. I trust this won’t take too long? And I do hope it’s not unduly… strenuous. I haven't the patience for complicated machinery or… blinking lights.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Oriley, it won’t be strenuous at all. Mostly just simple questions and observations. I’ll do my best to be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your hearing. Could you tell me, have you noticed any difficulty hearing in either ear recently?
PATIENT: Difficulty… Hmm. That’s a rather broad question, isn’t it? Well, my wife – my ex-wife, rather – always complained I didn't listen to her. But I put that down to the content of her monologues, not a deficiency in my auditory system. As for objectively… I suppose things aren't as sharp as they once were. But what old man would claim otherwise? Is there a specific range of frequencies you’re interested in? This is quite vague, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Oriley. It is rather broad. Let's try a more specific question. Do you have trouble hearing people speak when they are a normal distance away?
PATIENT: Normal distance? And what, pray tell, constitutes "normal"? Is that a standardized measurement now? People speak at varying volumes, you know. Some mumble, others shout. It depends entirely on the individual and the environment. Look, I can hear perfectly well enough for all practical purposes. I haven't missed a board meeting yet, have I? This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question the subjectivity of "normal," Mr. Oriley. I apologize for the vague phrasing. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Have you noticed yourself needing to ask people to repeat themselves more often than you used to?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… my assistant, young Ingrid, does occasionally have a rather soft voice. And she tends to rush her speech. I may have requested a repetition or two. But that's hardly indicative of a hearing impairment, is it? It’s more a matter of ensuring clarity in workplace communication. Honestly, the youth of today lack proper enunciation. It's a general decline, I assure you. A general decline.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, let’s shift gears then. How about your vision?
PATIENT: My vision? Perfectly adequate, thank you very much. I’ve always had excellent eyesight, despite spending countless hours poring over reports and… well, never mind. Though, admittedly, reading small print has become… more challenging in recent years. But who doesn’t require reading glasses eventually? It’s a natural consequence of aging. I’m not one of those who refuses to admit needing assistance, you know. It's simply a matter of convenience.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Oriley. We can certainly check your vision and see if a simple adjustment to your prescription would be helpful. Would you mind reading the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, the lighting in here is rather… harsh. And the font is quite small. E… H… P… V… Five… No, wait… is that a K? This is rather… imprecise. Are you certain this chart is calibrated correctly? I suspect my current prescription is perfectly adequate.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Oriley. I am noting your responses. Now, let's try the second line. And you are right to point out the lighting; I'll make a note to have that adjusted.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is rather tedious. And the letters are so… indistinct. U… F… Nine… Q? No, that looks more like a… Oh, bother. Is that a B or a D? They really are very similar, you know. And the lighting is still dreadful. This is hardly a conclusive assessment, is it? I suspect a more thorough examination is required. Perhaps with better equipment? And certainly better lighting.
DOCTOR: You are right, Mr. Oriley. A more comprehensive examination would be beneficial. Based on what I’ve observed, it does appear you might benefit from an updated vision prescription. And it sounds like you are experiencing some mild difficulty with your hearing as well. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to schedule you for a full audiological and ophthalmological evaluation. These tests will provide much more precise measurements. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A full evaluation, you say? Yes, that sounds… sensible. Thoroughness is paramount, after all. Though I must reiterate, I haven’t noticed any significant deterioration. It’s simply… a precautionary measure. Very well. Schedule me for these… evaluations. But please ensure they are conducted with the most up-to-date equipment. And a comfortable environment, if possible. I have a rather demanding schedule, you understand. And could you perhaps recommend a decent optician in the area? I prefer someone with a… discerning eye. This administrative burden is quite exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I’m scheduling you for a comprehensive audiological exam with Dr. Anya Petrova next Tuesday at 10:00 AM, and an ophthalmological evaluation with Dr. Stefan Ivanov the following Thursday at 2:00 PM. Both are excellent specialists. As for an optician, I highly recommend Ms. Elina Georgieva at Clarity Vision. She is known for her expertise and attention to detail. I will provide you with their contact information and addresses upon your departure. Do those times work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten… and Thursday at two… Yes, that should be acceptable. Though it does rather disrupt my routine. Very well. Schedule those appointments, then. I trust they will be efficient and… unobtrusive. And please, ensure they are aware of my… professional status. I haven’t time for unnecessary delays. Clarity Vision, you say? Very well. I shall investigate. Is there anything else you require from me at this juncture? I have a rather pressing engagement shortly.
DOCTOR: No, that is all for now, Mr. Oriley. I’ve noted everything and will send you confirmation emails with the appointment details and contact information for both specialists. We've covered your concerns and have a plan in place to address them. I'll also send a summary of our consultation to your primary care physician. Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to seeing you again after your evaluations. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Confirmation emails will suffice. And a summary for my physician is… prudent. I trust these specialists are… competent. I haven’t time for amateurs. Very well. I shall await the emails. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though I must admit, this entire process has been rather… disruptive. Good day. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Oriley. I assure you, both Dr. Petrova and Dr. Ivanov are highly respected in their fields. I’m confident you will be in excellent hands. Have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
