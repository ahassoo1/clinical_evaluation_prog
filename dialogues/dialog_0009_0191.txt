DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in... to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do, and I thought it best to just get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. That's a very responsible decision. It’s good you’re prioritizing your health. Before we proceed with the testing, I’d like to ask you a few questions to better understand your risk factors and ensure we’re doing the right test for you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, ask away. I’ll answer as best as I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you. To start, have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall, no. Not directly, anyway. My husband, he had a surgery a few years back, maybe 2018, and he needed a transfusion then, but that wasn’t me. I haven’t personally had one, to my knowledge. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I was asking. Thank you for clarifying. And have you ever shared needles with anyone, for any reason – whether for medical purposes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never shared a needle with anyone. I wouldn’t dream of it. I’m quite particular about hygiene, you see. And I certainly don't engage in... that sort of behaviour.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shaub. Those are very important questions, and I appreciate your honesty. Now, have you had any sexual contact with anyone in the past six months?
PATIENT: Well… yes, I have. My husband and I are… quite regular, if you understand me. We’ve been married for… oh, goodness, forty years now. So, yes, I have had sexual contact within the last six months. Is that… relevant? I mean, we’ve been together a long time.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Shaub. Knowing your sexual history helps us determine the best course of action for testing and prevention. Since you've been married for forty years, that’s wonderful. However, even in long-term relationships, it's important to consider HIV testing. Have either you or your husband ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: That’s a good point, Doctor. No, actually, neither of us have. It’s never… come up, if you know what I mean. We always assumed… well, we assumed everything was alright. It hasn’t been something we’ve discussed or worried about, to be honest. It’s… a little embarrassing to admit, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Shaub. It’s very common for people to not have discussed this with their long-term partners. The important thing is that you’re addressing it now. Since neither of you have been tested before, I recommend we proceed with testing for both of you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it’s the right thing to do, then yes, let’s test both of us. I’d rather know, truly. What does the testing involve? Will it be painful? I’m not fond of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The most common test we use is a blood draw, which does involve a needle, I understand your apprehension. However, it’s a quick prick, and most people tolerate it well. We’ll use a small needle, and I’m very experienced at minimizing discomfort. It will take just a few minutes to collect the sample. The blood will then be sent to the lab for analysis. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. There are also rapid HIV tests available, which use a finger prick, but those results are sometimes less accurate than a blood draw. For a more comprehensive picture, I recommend the blood draw. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood draw sounds… better, I suppose, than a finger prick. If it’s more accurate, then let’s do that. A few days isn’t too long to wait. What if… what if the result is positive? What happens then?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Shaub, and it's good you're thinking ahead. If the result is positive, it means you have the HIV virus. It’s a serious diagnosis, but it is manageable with treatment. We would immediately connect you with an HIV specialist, who would discuss treatment options with you. The good news is that with antiretroviral therapy – that’s medication – people with HIV can live long and healthy lives. They can even achieve an undetectable viral load, which means they can't transmit the virus to others. We would also provide counseling and support services to help you cope with the diagnosis and manage your health. We wouldn't leave you to face this alone. Would you like me to explain more about HIV treatment and management?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… reassuring to hear, that it is manageable. I’ve always thought of HIV as a… death sentence, if you know what I mean. To hear that it’s treatable, that people can live normal lives… that’s a relief. What kind of medication is involved? Are there side effects? And… what about my husband? If I test positive, would he definitely have it too?
DOCTOR: That’s a very common misconception, Ms. Shaub, and I'm glad I can clear that up for you. HIV treatment typically involves a combination of antiretroviral medications, often taken as a single pill once a day. These medications work by preventing the virus from replicating in the body, which allows the immune system to recover. As for side effects, they can vary depending on the specific medications, but they are generally mild and manageable. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and headache. We would monitor you closely for any side effects and adjust the medications as needed. Now, regarding your husband, if you test positive, it means he has likely been exposed to the virus. We would test him immediately to confirm his status. If he tests positive, he would also need to start treatment. If he tests negative, we would discuss post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, which is a course of medication that can prevent infection if started within 72 hours of exposure. It's important to remember that HIV is not easily transmitted. It can only be spread through certain body fluids, such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluids. Casual contact, such as hugging or sharing utensils, does not spread the virus. Would you like me to explain more about how HIV is transmitted and how to prevent it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That all sounds… overwhelming, to be honest. But it’s good to know there are options. And about the transmission… it’s just that, after forty years, we haven't… well, we haven’t always been careful. Not in the way one should be, I suppose. And it’s frightening to think that… that we might have put each other at risk.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, Ms. Shaub, and it’s very brave of you to share that with me. Many people find themselves in similar situations, and it’s never too late to take steps to protect your health. HIV is primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. As you mentioned, unprotected sex carries the risk of transmission. Since you and your husband haven’t always been consistent with protection, testing is extremely important. We’ll start with the blood draw for both of you. While we wait for the results, we can discuss safe sex practices and other ways to prevent transmission. If either of you tests positive, we will immediately connect you with the resources you need to manage your health and prevent further transmission. Do you have any questions about the blood draw procedure itself?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand the blood draw. It's just… the waiting. And the possibility of… a positive result. But I suppose there’s no avoiding it. Alright. Let’s just get it done then. I’d rather know, even if it’s bad news.
DOCTOR: That’s a very courageous decision, Ms. Shaub. You’re right, knowing is always better. Alright. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we’ll get yours drawn as well. She will explain the process to you. She’s very gentle and experienced. Afterwards, I’ll have Sarah schedule a follow-up appointment for both of you to discuss the results. It usually takes about three to five business days to get them back. In the meantime, do you have any other concerns or questions I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. And patient. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you both, no matter what the results may be. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Sarah will be with you shortly. .
