DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Antoine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s…rather embarrassing, to be frank. I have a bit of a…problem in my mouth. A white coating, you see. Not ideal. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don't mind being quick about it. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. No need to be embarrassed at all; these things happen. We'll take a look and see what’s going on. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. A white coating in the mouth can have several causes, and it’s always best to rule things out. Now, when did you first notice this coating?
PATIENT: Honestly, I couldn’t tell you precisely. A week, maybe? Two? It’s not like I spend my days examining my…oral cavity. It just appeared. Look, is it serious? Because I really don't have time for…complex treatments. I work with trees, Doctor. Faller, you understand? It requires…stamina.
DOCTOR: I understand. Working as a faller is physically demanding. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. A week or two…okay. And has it been getting worse, staying the same, or even improving at all?
PATIENT: Worse, I suppose. Definitely worse. It's…spreading, if you can believe it. And it’s rather…unpleasant to eat. Everything tastes…off. Though, truthfully, my wife's cooking is often questionable regardless. But that's beside the point. Just…fix it, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We will. Spreading and affecting your taste… that’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Discomfort? Yes. It’s…irritating. A constant feeling like something is…there. Look, I’m a practical man, Doctor. I deal with sharp objects all day. I can handle discomfort. I just don't want whatever this is to…interfere with my work. Is it contagious? My wife…she’s a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about contagiousness, that's very thoughtful of you. It's good to be mindful of your wife. Some causes are contagious, others aren’t. We'll need to examine your mouth to get a better idea. Before we do that, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No. Nothing. Just the…white stuff. Look, honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for complaining. I’ve got splinters, cuts, bruises…that’s part of the job. I don’t usually bother doctors with minor ailments. But my wife insisted. Said it looked…bad. She's probably exaggerating. Just…can we get this over with? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. We'll get this over with quickly. Just open wide for me, please. I'm going to take a look around, and I'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. Hmm… yes, I see what you mean. It appears to be a fairly widespread coating on your tongue and along your inner cheeks. It doesn’t appear to be ulcerated or bleeding, which is good. It could be a number of things – a fungal infection is a possibility, or perhaps a reaction to something. Do you use any mouthwash or have you changed toothpastes recently?
PATIENT: Fungal…infection? Really? Like…thrush? My wife always talks about thrush. Honestly, I have no idea what she uses. She buys all the…hygiene products. I just brush my teeth. Standard toothpaste, the…white one. Nothing fancy. Look, is it serious? Will I need…pills? Because I have to be alert on the job. I can't be…drowsy.
DOCTOR: Thrush is certainly a possibility, yes. It’s a common fungal infection in the mouth. It's rarely serious, but it can be uncomfortable. And you’re right to be concerned about alertness—certain medications can cause drowsiness. Based on what you've told me and what I see, it could be thrush. However, to be certain, I'd like to take a quick swab of the area and send it to the lab for analysis. It's a simple test, and it will give us a definitive answer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A lab test? More waiting? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming a rather protracted affair. Look, is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if it looks like thrush, can’t you just…treat it? I really don't have time for…microscopic examinations. It's just a white coating, not…the plague. But…fine. If you insist. Get it over with quickly, please. I have trees to fell. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. You’re right, many cases of thrush can be effectively treated based on visual examination alone. However, a swab will help rule out other possibilities, just to be absolutely sure. It's a precaution, and it only takes a moment. Alright, that’s all done. I’ll send this off to the lab, and we should have results in a few days. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I’ll prescribe an antifungal mouthwash. It's available over-the-counter, so you won’t need a prescription. Use it twice a day after brushing your teeth. .
