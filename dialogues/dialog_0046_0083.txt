DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Glowka, you say? Hmm. Well, it's a bit silly, really. My daughter, she thinks I need… a card. A “get well” card. She says I sound… low. I feel alright, mostly. Just… old, you know? But she insisted I come see a doctor for… encouragement. Is that what doctors do now? Write cards?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kammer. It's good of your daughter to be concerned, and we’re happy to help, even if it's just for reassurance. “Encouragement” is certainly part of the job! It’s not unusual to feel a little “low” as we get older, and it’s important to rule out anything that might be causing it. Let’s start by talking a bit more about how you've been feeling. You mentioned sounding “low” – can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… I guess my voice is a little rough sometimes. Not a cold, not a cough. Just… tired sounding. And I don't have the… pep I used to. Used to be able to work all day on the boilers, no problem. Now… I take a few more breaks. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. It's not pain, you understand. Just… less. Less everything.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kammer. “Less everything” is a very helpful way to put it. And it's important to note that changes like this, even without pain, are worth investigating. So, this “less everything” – has it been happening gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Hard to say exactly when. Things just… slipped. A little harder to get up in the morning, a little less interested in the baseball games. It wasn't one day, you know? More like… the color faded a little bit each week. My ex-wife would say I always was slow to notice things. She had a sharp eye, that one.
DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful way to describe it – like the color fading. And it's common for changes to happen gradually, making them harder to pinpoint. It sounds like this has been going on for a little while now. Besides the tiredness and less interest in things, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite isn't what it used to be, I suppose. Used to be able to eat a whole plate of mofongo, no problem. Now… a few bites, and I'm full. And… sometimes I feel a little… shaky. Not all the time, just… a little tremble in my hands. It's not bad enough to spill anything, but I notice it. My daughter says I walk a little slower too. She's very observant, that one. Always was.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, occasional shakiness in your hands, and your daughter has noticed you're walking a little slower. That’s helpful information, Mr. Kammer. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, I sleep alright, I think. Get to bed around ten, wake up around six. Not much trouble falling asleep, but I don't always sleep through. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. Not every night, mind you. And I don't usually have trouble getting back to sleep. It's just… not as solid as it used to be. I used to be able to sleep like a log. Now… a little more aware of things. The creaks in the house, things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're sleeping generally, but it's not as restful as it once was, and you're more aware of noises during the night. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. They gave me some pills for it. I don’t take them anymore, the doctor said I was doing well. And… I had my gallbladder out, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… not much. I've been pretty lucky, I always thought. Knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Kammer. So, high blood pressure in the past, currently well-managed, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I know. My wife tried to get me to eat more vegetables, said I should be allergic to something with that diet, but no luck.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little aspirin sometimes, for my knees. They bother me when it's cold. And I take a multivitamin, just a general one. My daughter makes sure I have it. She's very good about that. Other than that, nothing. I don't like taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just aspirin as needed for your knees and a daily multivitamin. Good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart. Something with the valves, I believe. My sister… she had high blood pressure, like me. And my daughter… she's healthy as a horse, thank goodness. But those are the ones I can think of, off the top of my head. It's hard to remember all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes in your mother, heart valve problems in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. That’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? You want to know if I like to go to parties? Because I don't much anymore. Used to, when I was younger, but not so much now. I'm divorced, been that way for… oh, twenty years now. I live alone. I used to work with the boilers, but I'm retired now. Mostly just stay home, watch the baseball games. That's about it.
DOCTOR: No, nothing like that, Mr. Kammer. “Social history” just means information about your lifestyle – things like your living situation, work history, and habits. You’ve already given me most of it – you live alone, you’re retired after working with boilers, and you enjoy watching baseball. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nope. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My mother didn't like smokers. And I drink a little wine sometimes, with dinner. A glass or two. Nothing much. Doctor says it's alright, as long as I don't overdo it. I don't overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking and just a glass or two of wine with dinner. That’s good to know. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me, Mr. Kammer. It gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and a few other things. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds fine. Just don’t poke me too much, Doctor. My knees ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Kammer. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, with a slight murmur, which we'll note. Lung sounds are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Gait is slightly slower than expected, with a mild decrease in arm swing. Alright, that’s all. Everything seemed within reasonable limits, but a few things caught my attention. The murmur I heard, the slightly diminished reflexes, and the slower gait. Given your history and these findings, I'd like to order a few lab tests, just to get a more complete picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds sensible. Lab tests, you say? What kind of tests? Blood tests? I don't like needles, Doctor. But if you think it's important… I guess I can handle it. Just try to be quick, alright? And tell me what you're looking for. I like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Kammer. We’ll do everything we can to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’d like to order a complete blood count – that checks for things like anemia and infection. I also want to check your kidney and liver function. And finally, I’d like to check your thyroid levels and Vitamin D. Those can sometimes cause fatigue and weakness. We’ll also check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes. It's a standard panel of tests, and it will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a plan to help you feel better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmm… sounds like a lot of tests. But alright. If you think it’s necessary. Vitamin D, you say? My daughter always tells me I need more sunshine. Maybe she’s right. So, what happens next? Do I come back here? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. And will my insurance cover all this? I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Kammer. We’ll draw the blood here at the clinic. It will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. And yes, Medicare should cover these tests. We’ll verify your coverage before we proceed, just to be sure. In the meantime, I want to address the possibility of a few things. Given your symptoms, the murmur I heard, and your family history, we need to rule out heart problems. We’ll also investigate the possibility of thyroid issues and Vitamin D deficiency. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds… thorough. Heart problems, you say? That’s a little worrying, but I guess it’s best to know. My father… he never took care of himself. Always smoking, always eating bad food. Maybe I inherited something from him. So, what do I do now? Do I need to fast before the blood tests? And should I tell my daughter about the heart thing? She worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. As for telling your daughter, that’s entirely up to you. If you think she’ll be overly worried, you can wait until we have the results. However, it’s also good to keep her informed, especially if you’re concerned. It might be helpful to let her know we’re running some tests to rule out potential problems, without going into too much detail. We’ll have the nurse go over all the instructions for the fasting and the blood tests before you leave. She can also answer any other questions you might have. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that we’re just being thorough. We haven’t made any definitive diagnosis yet. Once we have the results, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on and develop a plan to get you feeling better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds sensible. No need to worry my daughter unnecessarily. I’ll tell her we’re getting some tests done, that's all. And I’ll remember to fast. 8 to 12 hours, you said? That means no coffee in the morning? That’s going to be tough. So, is there anything I need to do now, besides fast? Should I be taking any vitamins or anything? Or avoiding anything? I don’t want to mess up the tests.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Kammer. No, you shouldn't start taking any new vitamins or supplements before the tests. And please avoid any strenuous exercise the day before. It can affect the results. Just continue with your normal routine as much as possible, except for the fasting and avoiding strenuous exercise. And please make sure you drink plenty of water in the days leading up to the tests. Hydration is important. The nurse will provide you with a detailed list of instructions before you leave. She’ll also answer any other questions you might have. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything pretty well. Fasting, no new vitamins, drink water… got it. And don’t worry my daughter. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. It was my pleasure. And you’re not an “old man,” just a gentleman taking care of his health. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She’ll be with you shortly. In the meantime, feel free to relax. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day.
