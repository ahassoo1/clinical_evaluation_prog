DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. It’s about… well, it’s about the masks at work. And other protective gear. I need to talk about getting a pass on wearing them, if possible. My work requires me to be… present with folks, and it’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: Difficult how, exactly?
PATIENT: It… makes it hard to connect. I work with people who’ve been through a lot, Doctor. A lot of trauma. And they need to see my face. See my expression. To know I understand. The mask… it feels like a wall. A barrier. It’s hard to build trust when half my face is hidden. It makes them uneasy, I can tell. And my job… it needs trust.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, that’s… not a medical reason to forgo proper protective equipment. We’re still seeing cases of respiratory illnesses, and frankly, trust isn't built on potentially endangering people. What exactly is your work?
PATIENT: I understand your concern, Doctor. Truly. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. I am a Protective Service Worker. I go into homes, work with families… folks who are struggling. Sometimes, with situations involving… abuse, or neglect. It requires a delicate touch. And being able to read faces… mine and theirs… is vital. It’s about de-escalation, building rapport… keeping everyone safe, including myself. It’s not just feeling better for me, it’s about being better at my job, and that protects everyone involved. I don’t want to put anyone at risk, but… the mask hinders my ability to do what I'm hired to do. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Protective Services… right. And your medical history shows… nothing relevant to a respiratory condition, thankfully. But look, Mr. Knabenshue, I appreciate you explaining, but we have guidelines for a reason. Are you experiencing any difficulty breathing with the mask?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No trouble breathing at all. It’s not… physical. It’s… how people react to me wearing it. They clam up. They’re less likely to share what’s really going on. They distrust me, I believe. It makes it harder to assess the situation properly, to know if a child is safe, or if someone needs immediate help. It’s subtle, but I’ve noticed a definite difference. I’ve been doing this work a long time, and I rely on those subtle cues.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s be clear. I’m not a psychologist, and frankly, this sounds like a… people skills issue. Perhaps some training in communicating through barriers?
PATIENT: With all due respect, Doctor, I believe you misunderstand. It's not a lack of skill. It’s the very nature of the work. I am skilled in reading people, and that skill is impaired by covering half my face. It’s not something that can be trained away. It’s about building genuine connection, and the mask… it disrupts that. I’m not asking to be exempt because I dislike wearing it, I’m asking because it prevents me from doing my job effectively, and potentially puts the people I serve at risk. Perhaps… could we explore alternatives? Different types of masks? Face shields? Anything that allows for more… visual communication?
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, I’m going to be frank. We've discussed this. I’m not comfortable providing a medical pass for something that isn’t a documented medical necessity. And frankly, face shields aren’t a sufficient replacement for masks in terms of droplet protection. I can, however, suggest a referral to a… stress management counselor. Might help you adjust to communicating while masked. Here's a number. Is there anything else medically concerning you today?
PATIENT: I appreciate your time, Doctor. And I understand your position. But I believe you are dismissing a legitimate concern. It's not about my stress, it’s about the well-being of the people I protect. I fear this will limit my ability to do that effectively. I suppose… I will need to consider my options. Thank you for listening, regardless. No, there is nothing else medically concerning me today. .
