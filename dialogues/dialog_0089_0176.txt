DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It’s quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups lasting over 48 hours is definitely something we want to look into. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They come and go, not really a pattern, just… randomly. Nothing seems to make them happen, and nothing seems to make them stop. I've tried drinking water quickly, holding my breath…you know, the usual things people suggest. And they haven't helped at all. It's just…hiccup, hiccup, hiccup. It's tiring, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Random onset, no clear triggers or relief with typical remedies. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. I haven't felt sick or anything. No fever, no stomach pain, no heartburn. I've been eating normally, sleeping okay…everything seems pretty normal except for these darn hiccups. I did feel a little stressed last week with my sister visiting, but she left a few days ago, and the hiccups started after she left, not during. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, no associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or fever, and the hiccups started after a period of stress. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, but I take medication for that, and it’s usually well-controlled. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that…no, nothing major. I don’t see doctors often, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal ten years ago. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think it’s Lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I get it refilled at the pharmacy regularly. No problems with that.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, thankfully! Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been lucky that way, I suppose. My sister’s got allergies to everything under the sun, but not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. One of those one-a-day things. Nothing special. And sometimes, if I’m feeling achy, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but not regularly. Maybe once a month, if that. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And to clarify, no family history of any significant medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My father had diabetes, type 2, but he lived a long life with it. And my mother had arthritis, but it wasn't anything too serious, just some joint pain. Nothing else really comes to mind. We weren’t a very medical family, if that makes sense. We just…dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of type 2 diabetes in your father and arthritis in your mother. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested. I like my tea, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, some fish, chicken… I like to cook, so I usually make things from scratch. I do enjoy a good dessert sometimes, can’t deny that! And I have a sweet tooth, I admit. But I try to keep the portions reasonable. It’s a Mediterranean-style diet, I suppose, if that makes sense. Lots of olive oil and fresh ingredients.
DOCTOR: Okay, a generally healthy Mediterranean diet with occasional sweets. Alright, Ivette, I’m seeing that you haven’t been seen here before. I’m just looking at some basic information… Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: That's perfectly fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm used to doctor visits, even if I don't enjoy them much. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s causing these hiccups. They’re driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or obvious abnormalities. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. And pulse is 72 and regular. Given the duration of the hiccups and the lack of any obvious underlying cause, I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any potential imbalances. Specifically, I want to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to have the tests done. Hopefully, they'll show something. I just want these hiccups to stop! How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to process the results. The nurse will call you with the results as soon as they're available. We may want to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, depending on what they show. In the meantime, if the hiccups worsen or you develop any other symptoms, like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that's very clear. 24-48 hours for the results, and call if anything gets worse. I'll keep an eye on things and won’t hesitate to go to the ER if needed. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s just…so frustrating to have something that won't go away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I understand it’s frustrating. We’ll get to the bottom of it. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood samples. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I just hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. I'll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette. You take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
