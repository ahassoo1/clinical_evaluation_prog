DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband suggested I come. He’s become rather insistent on these… arrangements. He wants me to fill out some paperwork, something about what happens if… if I become unable to make decisions. He called it an “advance directive” or a “POLST form,” I believe. Honestly, I find the whole thing a bit morbid, but he’s quite worried. I suppose I’m here to get the forms and understand what precisely they are.
DOCTOR: Right. An advance directive and a POLST form. Your husband is… proactive, I suppose. It is sensible to consider these things, though I agree, dwelling on them isn’t particularly pleasant. Essentially, an advance directive – also called a living will – outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you were to become incapacitated and unable to communicate them yourself. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific medical order, typically for patients with serious illnesses, detailing what treatments you want or don't want. Do you have any existing documentation regarding these wishes?
PATIENT: Existing documentation? No, absolutely not. I’ve never felt the need to pre-plan such things. I’ve always been perfectly capable of speaking for myself, and I intend to remain so. My husband, bless his heart, tends to overthink. He watches too much television, I suspect. All those dramatic medical shows… it’s filled his head with anxieties. I’m here because he wants me to be prepared for… well, for the inevitable, I suppose. But frankly, I find the whole premise rather unsettling. It implies a lack of faith, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily imply a lack of faith, Ms. Chilla. It’s more about ensuring your preferences are respected, regardless of circumstance. It’s a matter of control, really. Though I concede, discussing end-of-life care can be… difficult. Before we proceed with the paperwork, let's establish your general health status. It will give us a baseline, and perhaps allay some of your husband’s concerns. Have you been seen by a physician recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Well, that depends on your definition of "recently." I had a check-up, I suppose, a few years ago. Nothing significant. I maintain a healthy lifestyle – I walk daily, I eat a balanced diet, and I don’t partake in any… unhealthy habits. I’ve always been quite robust, truthfully. My mother lived to be ninety-three, you know. Excellent genes, I believe. I don’t typically bother doctors unless absolutely necessary. It’s usually a waste of time and money, in my opinion. But if you must know, I had a minor bout of indigestion last month, but it resolved on its own. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Indigestion is noted. While your robust health is encouraging, a few years is rather lengthy for a routine check-up. And even with excellent genes, things can change. It’s important to have a current understanding of your medical history, especially as you approach… a certain age. Let’s start with some basic questions, then. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you implying I look unwell? I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. But very well, to appease my husband and satisfy your… protocols. No, I have no chronic medical conditions. Not a single one. I’ve never been one for complaining, and I certainly don’t go running to the doctor for every minor ache or pain. Hypertension? Diabetes? Good heavens, no. I eat a sensible diet, I told you. Lots of vegetables, lean protein… none of that processed rubbish. And I exercise regularly. I find walking to be quite invigorating. I’m quite active, actually. Is this really necessary? We’re supposed to be discussing these… forms, aren’t we?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Chilla, because these forms require a comprehensive understanding of your health status to be legally sound. I am not implying you look unwell. I am gathering information. And while your lifestyle is commendable, it doesn’t preclude the possibility of underlying conditions. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, when I was a child, I had my tonsils removed. A very standard procedure, I believe. And… and when I gave birth to my son, of course. But aside from those two instances, no. Absolutely not. I’ve always been remarkably healthy. I’ve never been one for accidents or illnesses, thankfully. My husband keeps mentioning all sorts of worst-case scenarios – pneumonia, heart attacks, strokes – but frankly, I find it rather alarmist. It's almost as if he wants something to happen to me, so he can… well, I don’t even want to think about it. Is this the sort of information you require, or are we simply cataloging every minor event in my distant past?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and childbirth are noted. And while I understand your frustration, Ms. Chilla, it's not about cataloging minor events. It's about identifying potential risks and ensuring your wishes are accurately documented. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none whatsoever. I've always been able to eat and take whatever is offered without any ill effects. I have a rather robust constitution, as I’ve mentioned. My mother always said I had a “cast iron stomach.” I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even shellfish, which I understand can be quite problematic for some people. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… tedious. Are we getting anywhere with these “forms” yet, or are we simply going to continue dissecting my entire life history? I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, this is a necessary process. We need to establish a clear medical baseline before discussing advance directives. It's not about tedious dissection; it's about responsible care. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly! As if I would need any! No. Absolutely none. I get all the vitamins and nutrients I require from a balanced diet. I don’t believe in relying on artificial substances to maintain my health. My mother always said a good, wholesome meal is the best medicine. And I wholeheartedly agree. I don’t take anything. Not a single pill, potion, or powder. I maintain a perfectly healthy lifestyle, as I’ve repeatedly stated. Are we finished yet? This is all rather… unsettling, frankly. It feels as though you’re looking for something to be wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I assure you, I am not looking for something to be wrong with you. I am attempting to gather a complete medical history, as is standard practice. However, if you are unwilling to provide this information, it will be difficult to proceed with any meaningful discussion about advance directives. Perhaps we should postpone this appointment and allow you time to consider whether you wish to participate in this process. It's important that you feel comfortable and informed.
PATIENT: Postpone it? Are you suggesting I’m being difficult? I simply find this entire process… unnecessary. My husband is the one who’s obsessed with worst-case scenarios and paperwork. I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. And I refuse to spend my afternoon dissecting my past for the benefit of… alarmist doctors. If you cannot simply provide the forms and explain them to me, then perhaps I will postpone this appointment. But I assure you, it will be the last time I waste my time on such… frivolous matters. Honestly, the very idea!
