DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s good to meet you as well. Though I must say, this practice is…rather quaint. But never mind that. I’m here about getting one of those medical marijuana cards, I believe they’re called. My daughter suggested it. She's always reading things online. I haven’t a clue where to even begin, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medical marijuana card. Absolutely. We can definitely explore that. It’s becoming more and more common, and it can be helpful for certain conditions. To see if you qualify, I need to get a good understanding of what’s going on with you – basically, a full medical history and what symptoms you’re hoping to treat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I’m seventy-four years old, Doctor. What isn’t aching? But I suppose…yes, alright. Though I don’t see the need to rehash my entire life story. I’m a generally healthy woman, all things considered. I was a bailiff for forty years, you know. A very physical job. Still am, actually, though I’ve scaled back a bit. But do go on. What precisely do you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It doesn’t need to be everything, just the things that are bothering you now, and anything that might be relevant to why you’re considering medical marijuana. We need to make sure it’s safe and appropriate for you. Let’s start with your aches and pains. Where are you feeling them most, and how long have they been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s everywhere, really. My knees, of course. Bad knees run in the family. And my back…lower back, mostly. It flares up when the weather changes. Honestly, it’s been going on for…well, decades. I've had it seen to, years ago. They said arthritis, gave me some pills. Didn't do much good, and frankly, I don’t like taking a lot of medication. That's why my daughter suggested this…marijuana. Is that even the right word to use in here? It sounds so…common.
DOCTOR: "Cannabis" is perfectly fine too, Ellan. And you’re right to be cautious about medication. We always want to weigh the benefits and risks. So, arthritis in your knees and lower back…and it’s been ongoing for decades. Do the pills you were prescribed help at all with the pain, even a little?
PATIENT: Oh, they took the edge off, perhaps. For an hour or so. Then the pain would return, and I’d be left feeling…sluggish. And the side effects weren’t pleasant, either. Constipation, mostly. I simply stopped taking them. I much prefer to manage it on my own, with a bit of heat and rest. Though, admittedly, it’s becoming harder to do. That's why I'm here, isn't it? I'm not looking for a miracle, Doctor, just…something to make things a little more bearable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pills didn’t provide lasting relief and had unpleasant side effects. Heat and rest help, but aren’t enough anymore. That’s very helpful to know. Now, besides the pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, my sleep isn’t what it used to be. I wake up several times during the night. And I’ve been…a bit more anxious lately. Nothing major, just…on edge. My daughter says it's the news. Always something terrible happening, isn't there? But I’ve always been a worrier, to be honest. It's just…worse now, perhaps. Does that count? I don't go around complaining to everyone, if that's what you mean. I'm a practical woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts, Ellan. Sleep problems and anxiety are very common, and they can often be connected to pain. So, to recap: you’re experiencing chronic pain in your knees and lower back, difficulty sleeping, and some increased anxiety. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, not really. I eat what I always eat. Nothing fancy, mind you. I like a good stew, and plenty of fruit. My husband does the cooking, thankfully. He’s a very good cook. But I haven’t noticed any…change. If anything, I’ve been eating less. Not because I don’t want to, just…not as hungry. Though, now that I think about it, I haven’t been enjoying my meals as much. Everything just tastes…bland, lately. Is that…a symptom, too? Really, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: No, Ellan, you’re not a hypochondriac at all. Changes in appetite and enjoyment of food can definitely be connected to pain, stress, and anxiety. It sounds like you're experiencing a cluster of symptoms, and it's good you're addressing them. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis is the only thing, really. High blood pressure, perhaps, years ago. But it was managed with diet and exercise. I don’t take any medication for it now. I've always been very careful about my health. My mother always said, "Prevention is better than cure." A very sensible woman, my mother. And no surgeries, no serious illnesses, thank goodness. I've been quite lucky, all things considered. Though, perhaps my luck is running out. That's why I'm here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with diet and exercise, no surgeries, and generally good health. That’s very good to know. What about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Dust bothers me a bit, perhaps, but who doesn’t sneeze when they’re cleaning? Nothing serious, Doctor. Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything dramatic like that. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies these days. Everything is an allergy. Is this all necessary, Doctor? I'm starting to feel quite exhausted just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. It's good to rule things out, and knowing you don’t have any allergies is helpful. We just want to be thorough. Last question about your history: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. As I said, I avoid medication whenever possible. I take a bit of vitamin D in the winter, perhaps, but that's it. My husband tried to get me to take some glucosamine for my knees, but I refused. I don't like putting all those chemicals into my body. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Heat, rest, a good cup of tea…those are my medicines. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very simple woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, that gives me a very good picture of your health. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if I can identify any specific areas of discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be gentle, Doctor. I’m not as young as I used to be, and my bones aren’t what they once were. And don't expect me to be doing any gymnastics. I'm here for a certification, not a medical examination. Though, I suppose a quick look can't hurt. Just…be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I'll be very gentle. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your knees and back. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. It's likely just from being in the office. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me, as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s…not very comfortable, Doctor. You see? This is what I mean. They're quite stiff. And they make a terrible cracking noise. It's very unsettling. There. Feel that? It's like gravel grinding together. I've had these knees for seventy-four years, you know. They've seen better days. Honestly, I don’t know what you expect to find. It's arthritis, plain and simple. A lifetime of wear and tear. Are you going to poke at them now? I really don't like being poked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I’m just checking for tenderness. There is a little soreness on the inside of both knees, which is common with arthritis. No significant swelling or warmth, which is good. Now, your lower back… a little tenderness here as well, and some muscle tightness. Can you tell me where exactly it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right there. It's a dull ache, mostly. But it flares up when I bend over, or lift something heavy. And when the weather changes, of course. It feels like…a knot. A very stubborn knot. It's always worse in the morning, when I get out of bed. I have to be very careful when I dress. And sometimes, it radiates down my leg. Not all the way, just…a bit. Does that make sense, Doctor? I'm not a medical professional, you know. I'm just an old woman with a bad back. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite tired. All this poking and prodding… it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. You’ve been very patient. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re dealing with chronic pain related to osteoarthritis in your knees and lower back, with some muscle spasm. The pain is impacting your sleep and your overall quality of life. Now, to determine if you might be a candidate for medical marijuana, there are a few more things we need to consider. Do you have any history of mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: Mental health conditions? Goodness, no. I’ve always been a very stable person. A bit of worry, perhaps, as I mentioned, but who doesn’t worry these days? But no, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like that. I’ve always been perfectly rational, perfectly sensible. My husband says I’m a bit of a fussbudget, but that’s not a mental health condition, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning a bit…invasive. Are you implying that I’m somehow unstable? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions. I simply want something to help me manage my pain, that’s all. And perhaps get a good night’s sleep. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ellan. I apologize if I came across that way. It’s simply standard procedure. We need to rule out any conditions that might make medical marijuana unsafe for you. It's not about questioning your stability, it's about ensuring your safety. And I understand your frustration. We're just trying to gather all the information needed to make the best decision for you. Now, one last question: have you tried any other treatments for your pain besides heat and rest?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Years and years of treatments. Physical therapy, of course. Didn't do much good. Painkillers, as I mentioned, with all those unpleasant side effects. Injections, a few times. They helped for a little while, then the pain came back. I even tried acupuncture, once. That was…interesting. But it didn't last. Honestly, I’ve tried everything. Everything! That's why I'm here, Doctor. I've exhausted all other options. I'm desperate for something that actually works. And I've heard…well, I've heard good things about this marijuana. Perhaps it's time to try something different. Perhaps it's time to give up and simply accept that I'm going to be in pain for the rest of my life. But I'd rather not, if possible. So, what do you think, Doctor? Am I a candidate?
DOCTOR: Based on your medical history, the physical exam, and the treatments you’ve already tried, it appears you may be a good candidate for medical marijuana. You’ve exhausted conventional treatments, and your pain is significantly impacting your quality of life. However, to proceed, I need to discuss the potential risks and benefits, and ensure you understand how it works. Are you familiar with the different forms of cannabis, such as oils, edibles, and flower?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I know absolutely nothing about it. My daughter mentioned something about oils, and…vaping, I think. But honestly, it all sounds very complicated. And a bit…illegal, if I’m being honest. I’m a law-abiding citizen, Doctor. I don’t want to get into any trouble. Flower? Edibles? What on earth are those? And what does it even feel like? I don't want to be…out of my mind, if you know what I mean. I need to be able to function, to take care of my husband, to go grocery shopping. I can’t be…incapacitated. Perhaps this isn’t such a good idea after all. Perhaps I should just accept my fate and continue suffering in silence. But…I'm willing to listen, if you think it's worth it. But please, explain it to me in simple terms. I’m an old woman, Doctor, not a scientist.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ellan. It can be confusing, and it's perfectly normal to be hesitant. Let's break it down. The goal isn't to get you "high," it's to manage your pain and improve your quality of life. There are different ways to consume cannabis, each with different effects. "Flower" is the dried plant material that you can smoke or vaporize. Vaporizing is generally considered safer than smoking. "Oils" are concentrated extracts that can be taken under the tongue or added to food. "Edibles" are food products that have been infused with cannabis. The key is to start with a very low dose and gradually increase it until you find the right amount for you. We'll be closely monitoring your response to ensure you experience the benefits without any unwanted side effects. The effects vary depending on the method of consumption and the dosage. Oils and edibles tend to have a longer and more sustained effect, while flower has a more immediate but shorter duration. As for legality, medical marijuana is legal in this state with a valid certification. I can help you with the application process. Do you have any specific concerns about any of these methods of consumption?
PATIENT: Well…the smoking, definitely not. I’ve never smoked in my life, and I don’t intend to start now. And the edibles…that sounds a bit…risky. I can barely manage my medication as it is, I don’t need to be accidentally eating something that will send me off to la-la land. That leaves the oils, I suppose. But what exactly does it feel like? Will I be dizzy? Will I forget things? Will I be able to drive? I need to be able to drive, Doctor. My husband needs me to run errands. And what about interactions with other medications? I don’t take much, just a bit of vitamin D in the winter. But I don’t want to risk any…complications. Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds very daunting. Perhaps I should just forget the whole thing. But…I’m willing to listen, if you think it’s safe. And if you can assure me that I won’t be…incapacitated.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ellan, and it’s good you’re thinking so carefully. You’re right to be cautious. Let’s focus on the oils, as that seems like the most comfortable option for you. With oils, the goal is to find a very low dose – we’re talking fractions of a milliliter – that provides relief without any psychoactive effects. Many patients experience only a calming effect, with reduced pain and anxiety. Dizziness is a possible side effect, but it’s usually mild and temporary, and it’s more common with higher doses. Forgetting things is not a typical side effect, but it’s important to be aware of any changes in your cognitive function and let me know immediately. As for driving, you should not drive if you feel any impairment. We'll start with a very low dose and carefully monitor your response to ensure you're safe to drive. Regarding interactions with vitamin D, there are no known significant interactions. However, it's always best to inform me of any new medications or supplements you're taking. To proceed, I'll need to fill out an application on your behalf. We'll also need to get your consent for medical cannabis. It's a relatively straightforward process. If approved, you'll receive a certification that allows you to purchase medical cannabis from a licensed dispensary. I'll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to use the oils safely and effectively, and I'll schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Well…it sounds complicated, but…less daunting than I initially thought. The low dose is reassuring, and I appreciate you emphasizing the safety aspect. And the follow-up appointments are good. I need someone to guide me through this process. I'm not a young woman anymore, Doctor. I need hand-holding. Very well. Let's proceed with the application. But I want everything in writing. Detailed instructions, potential side effects, your contact information…everything. And I want to be able to reach you if I have any questions or concerns. I don't want to be left to fend for myself. And…what about the cost? Is this going to break the bank? My husband is retired, and we're on a fixed income. I don't want to put him through any unnecessary financial strain. Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds very expensive. But…I’m willing to try, if you think it’s safe. And if you can assure me that I won’t be…incapacitated. So, what do we do now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I completely understand your concerns, and I’m happy to provide you with all the information you need. I have detailed instructions on everything, including potential side effects and my contact information. We’ll also discuss the cost, and I’ll provide you with a list of licensed dispensaries in your area. Here’s the application form. It’s fairly straightforward, but I’ll be happy to assist you with any questions you have. It asks for your medical history, your current medications, and your consent for medical cannabis. The cost of medical cannabis varies depending on the dispensary and the product. However, it’s generally comparable to the cost of other prescription medications. Many dispensaries offer discounts for seniors and veterans. I can also provide you with information on financial assistance programs. As for being “incapacitated,” that’s extremely unlikely with the low dose we’ll be starting with. We’ll closely monitor your response and adjust the dosage accordingly. If you experience any unwanted side effects, we’ll stop immediately. Does that address all your concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm. It does seem…less daunting than I initially thought. And the assistance with the form is appreciated. I'm not very good with computers, you know. And the discounts for seniors are good. My husband will be pleased. But what about the smell? I don't want my house to smell like…a marijuana den. My neighbors would talk. And what about legal issues? Can I travel with it? Can I take it on an airplane? I don't want to get arrested. Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds very complicated. But…I'm willing to try, if you think it's safe. And if you can assure me that I won't be…incapacitated. And if you can help me navigate all the legal issues. And if you can assure me that my neighbors won't talk. And if you can assure me that my husband won't be disappointed. So, what do we do now? Are you sure this is a good idea? Perhaps I should just stick to heat and rest. It's safer, at least. But…I'm willing to listen, if you think it's worth it. Just…please be patient with me. I'm an old woman, Doctor, and I'm easily confused. And I don't want to get arrested.
DOCTOR: Ellan, you’re asking all the right questions, and it’s good you’re thinking so carefully. Let’s address each concern one by one. Regarding the smell, there are ways to minimize it. You can use airtight containers, and many dispensaries offer odorless products. You can also use air fresheners or ventilation to keep your house smelling fresh. As for legal issues, traveling with medical cannabis is complicated. It’s generally illegal to transport it across state lines, even if you have a valid certification. Taking it on an airplane is also prohibited. We’ll discuss your travel plans before proceeding to ensure you’re not violating any laws. Regarding your neighbors, I can’t guarantee they won’t talk, but I can assure you that possessing medical cannabis with a valid certification is legal in this state. As for your husband, I understand your concerns. I encourage you to discuss it with him openly and honestly. Many spouses are supportive of medical cannabis, especially when it helps alleviate pain and improve quality of life. I understand your hesitation, and I assure you that I wouldn’t recommend this if I didn’t believe it could help you. We’ll proceed slowly and carefully, and we’ll closely monitor your response every step of the way. We can start with a very low dose and see how you feel. If you experience any unwanted side effects, we’ll stop immediately. I’m here to guide you through this process, and I’ll answer any questions you have. So, what do you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It all sounds very complicated. But…you seem very knowledgeable, Doctor. And you've answered all my questions, as best you can. And I am tired of being in pain. And I want to be able to drive. And I don't want to disappoint my husband. Very well. Let's proceed with the application. But I want everything in writing. And I want to be able to reach you if I have any questions or concerns. And I want to be able to stop at any time. And I want to be able to drive. And I don't want to get arrested. But…please be patient with me. I'm an old woman, Doctor, and I'm easily confused. And I don't want to get arrested. And I don't want to disappoint my husband. And I don't want my neighbors to talk. And I don't want to be incapacitated. And I don't want to be in pain. So, what do we do now? And please, be gentle with me. I'm an old woman, Doctor. And I'm easily confused. And I don't want to get arrested.
DOCTOR: Ellan, you’ve got it. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll be here every step of the way. I completely understand your concerns, and I’ll address each one. Here, let's start with your name and address. Don't worry, we'll take our time. And remember, you can stop at any time. And I’ll provide you with a list of licensed dispensaries in your area, as well as detailed instructions on how to use the oils safely and effectively. And remember, I’m always here to answer any questions you have. We're making progress, Ellan. And you're doing great.
