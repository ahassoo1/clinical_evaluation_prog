DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. Well, it’s rather embarrassing to admit, but it concerns a… dietary experiment, shall we say? A rather foolish one, in hindsight. I was hoping you might have a look at it and tell me if I’ve done myself any lasting harm. It involved… well, a great deal of cabbage. And very little else.
DOCTOR: Ah, a dietary experiment! No need to be embarrassed, Mr. Vantine, these things happen. We all try new things. And you’re very wise to come in and get it checked out. To start, could you tell me a bit more about this experiment?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It began, as these things often do, with a television program. A documentary, actually, extolling the virtues of… well, essentially a liquid diet comprised almost entirely of cabbage juice. Supposedly it detoxifies the system, aids weight loss, prevents… a great many things, if one is to believe the presenters. I, perhaps foolishly, decided to put it to the test. I started on July 1st. Just cabbage juice – freshly squeezed, mind you, I'm not a barbarian – three times a day. No solid food whatsoever. I continued for the entire month. It was… challenging. And increasingly gaseous.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you were on a solely cabbage juice diet from July 1st to July 31st. And you mentioned it was…challenging and gaseous?
PATIENT: Precisely, Doctor. “Challenging” is a rather diplomatic way of putting it, actually. It was extraordinarily… restrictive. And the, ahem, byproducts were… noticeable. My housekeeper threatened mutiny. And, frankly, so did my digestive system. Beyond that, I felt… rather weak by the end of it. A bit lightheaded. And, though I haven’t been formally diagnosed, my joints have been aching a bit since resuming a normal diet. I’m afraid I hadn't considered the potential for nutritional deficiencies. I was rather swept up in the enthusiasm of the program, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you experienced quite a few side effects. That documentary certainly didn't mention the potential drawbacks, did it?
PATIENT: Indeed not, Doctor. It was all glowing testimonials and before-and-after photographs. They failed to mention the distinct possibility of alienating one's domestic staff, or the sheer volume of… refuse one produces. Or, for that matter, the feeling of perpetual emptiness. A rather significant omission, I’d say. I now suspect that the presenters were rather generously padding their waistlines with something other than cabbage juice.
DOCTOR: It certainly sounds like a rather unbalanced approach, Mr. Vantine. Before we go further, let's do a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia in 1978, but recovered fully. And I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about ten years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, I’ve been remarkably fortunate. A good constitution, I suppose. And I’ve always been rather careful about my diet – before this recent… folly. I do have a slight allergy to penicillin, if that’s relevant. And… oh, yes. I had my appendix removed in 1962. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That's very helpful. Are you currently taking any medications for your hypertension, or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once daily, for the hypertension. That’s all. And, I assure you, I’ve been diligent about adhering to the prescription, even during this… experimental period. I wouldn't risk my health, even for the sake of a television program. I also take a daily multivitamin, just as a precaution. Though, given the circumstances, it seems to have been a rather ineffective one.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And before we proceed, do you have any family history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… my father suffered from heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away at the age of 72 from a myocardial infarction. My mother, on the other hand, lived to be 93, but developed Type 2 diabetes in her late eighties. And my younger sister has a history of breast cancer, though she is now in remission, thankfully. Beyond that, nothing particularly noteworthy, as far as I am aware. A relatively healthy lineage, all things considered. Except, perhaps, for a predilection for watching dubious television programs.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That's very helpful information. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve never been a smoker, not even a puff. The thought has always seemed rather barbaric. I do enjoy a glass of sherry with my dinner occasionally – perhaps two, if it’s been a particularly trying day. And absolutely no recreational drugs. I have always prided myself on my self-discipline, even if it occasionally leads to ill-advised dietary experiments. Though, I assure you, the only “high” I experienced during this ordeal was the one induced by sheer relief when I finally consumed a properly cooked steak.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Vantine. Now, to get a better understanding of your current condition, could you describe your symptoms in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as I mentioned, the most immediate consequence was the… digestive unrest. An abundance of, shall we say, gaseous expulsion, accompanied by a rather unsettling rumbling. Beyond that, I felt… progressively weaker. A general lethargy, a lack of energy. And by the end of the month, I was experiencing a rather persistent lightheadedness. Standing up would often require a moment of careful equilibrium. And, more recently, my joints have been aching. A dull, throbbing pain in my knees and hips. I hadn’t considered myself particularly prone to joint pain before, but it’s become increasingly noticeable over the past week. It’s… rather discouraging, actually. I enjoy a brisk walk in the garden, and I fear I may have to curtail those activities.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like you’ve experienced quite a few symptoms. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. I anticipated as much, of course. I’m quite used to medical examinations, sadly. Though, I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of the stethoscope. It always feels… invasive. But please, proceed. I trust your judgement implicitly. And, if you happen to detect any lingering cabbage aroma, please refrain from mentioning it. It’s rather… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I’d like to examine your joints, and check your reflexes. Shall we begin with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, let’s proceed. Blood pressure first sounds perfectly sensible. I do hope it’s not excessively elevated. I’ve been trying to remain calm, but the memory of that documentary is rather… agitating. And the thought of discussing the cabbage again… But, yes, proceed. I shall endeavor to remain composed. And, if you require a small cushion for my arm, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm not as robust as I once was, you see.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140 over 85, Mr. Vantine. It’s a bit elevated, but not alarming, especially given your description of feeling agitated. Your heart rate is 72, which is normal, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in, and exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Deep breath in… inhales deeply… and exhale slowly… exhales slowly… I always feel rather theatrical during this part of the examination. As if I'm performing a one-man play entitled "The Anxious Patient." Takes another deep breath… and exhale. Is everything sounding as it should? I do hope I haven’t developed a cabbage-related wheeze. Chuckles nervously
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Mr. Vantine, no murmurs detected. Your lung sounds are clear, bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. I detect a slightly diminished breath sound in the bases, but that’s not particularly concerning given your age. Now, let’s take a look at your joints. Could you please bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Bends knees, wincing slightly Oh dear. That’s… less comfortable than it used to be. A distinct… creaking sound, I’m afraid. It’s rather reminiscent of an old door hinge. I do hope I haven't sustained any lasting damage. Are you detecting any… inflammation? Or merely the lamentable evidence of advancing years? And please, be gentle. I fear I may be a fragile specimen.
DOCTOR: I detect mild tenderness on palpation of the medial joint line of both knees, Mr. Vantine, and mild swelling. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but I don’t detect any significant crepitus, or warmth, or redness. Now, let’s examine your hips. Could you please rotate your hips inward and outward for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Rotates hips inward and outward, grimacing slightly Oh, good heavens. That’s… not entirely pleasant. A distinct twinge of discomfort, I’m afraid. It feels rather… restricted. As if I've been encased in a rather unforgiving exoskeleton. Are you detecting any… grinding sensations? Or merely the inevitable consequences of gravity and the passage of time? And, if you wouldn't mind, perhaps a small cushion for my bottom? It's rather a hard chair, you see.
DOCTOR: I detect mild tenderness to palpation of the greater trochanter bilaterally, Mr. Vantine, and reduced range of motion, particularly with internal rotation. I don't detect any audible grinding sensations. I’ll get you a cushion right away. I retrieve a cushion from a nearby chair and place it under Mr. Vantine. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap lightly on your knees with this small hammer. I gently tap Mr. Vantine’s knees with a reflex hammer.
PATIENT: Ah, the reflex hammer. A tool of both science and mild apprehension. Very well, proceed, Doctor. I brace myself slightly as the hammer taps my knees. Oh dear. That’s… a bit startling. Do tell me if my reflexes are… adequate. I wouldn't want to be accused of being… unresponsive. And please, be gentle. I do have sensitive knees, you see. Is everything sounding as it should? I always feel rather like a laboratory specimen during these examinations.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are 2+, bilaterally, Mr. Vantine, and symmetric, which is within normal limits. Alright, that concludes the physical examination. Thank you for your patience. Based on my examination and your history, it seems you are experiencing some joint pain and weakness likely secondary to the restrictive diet and possible nutritional deficiencies. Do you have any lab work done recently?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. A rather thorough examination, I must say. And, thankfully, my reflexes haven’t completely deserted me. Chuckles wryly No, I haven’t had any lab work done recently. Not since my annual check-up last year, which revealed nothing particularly alarming, except for a slightly elevated cholesterol level. I suspect that's due to my fondness for sherry, rather than the cabbage. But I'm happy to have some blood work done, if you think it would be helpful. I trust your judgement implicitly. Do you suspect I’m deficient in any particular vitamins or minerals? Perhaps I need to increase my intake of… kale? Though the thought fills me with dread.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do think some blood work would be very helpful, Mr. Vantine. It will give us a better understanding of your nutritional status and help rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. Specifically, I'd like to check your vitamin D levels, B12, folate, iron, and calcium. We can also assess your liver and kidney function, as those can be affected by restrictive diets. And while kale is a good source of nutrients, you may have experienced deficiencies in other areas as well. Based on your symptoms, I suspect deficiencies in Vitamin C and potentially some essential fatty acids. I'll write an order for the blood work now. We can discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, I recommend starting a multivitamin and increasing your protein intake. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of before ordering the bloodwork?
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. A comprehensive approach, as always. Blood work it is. And I commend your suggestion of a multivitamin. Perhaps it will counteract some of the damage inflicted by my dietary folly. As for allergies… yes, I have a slight allergy to penicillin, as I mentioned earlier. And I'm rather sensitive to shellfish, but that shouldn't affect the blood work, should it? Beyond that, nothing particularly alarming. I can tolerate kale, though I find its taste… somewhat objectionable. And I have no objection to protein, as long as it’s properly cooked. I do enjoy a good steak, you see. Though, perhaps not as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. I’ve noted the penicillin allergy. The blood work shouldn't cause any issues, and it should give us a better understanding of what’s going on. While we’re waiting for the results, I also recommend increasing your fluid intake and getting some gentle exercise, as tolerated. I’ll write you a prescription for a multivitamin with Vitamin D and B12. Based on what you’ve described, I suspect your symptoms will improve with improved nutrition and hydration. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. A prescription for a multivitamin sounds excellent, and I shall endeavor to increase my fluid intake. Gentle exercise… perhaps a short stroll in the garden, rather than a rigorous hike. Actually, yes, I do have one question. I’ve been reading about… rebound weight gain, after restrictive diets. Is that a significant concern? I wouldn't want to undo any progress I’ve made, by… indulging excessively. Though, I assure you, my appetite is considerably diminished at this point. But I thought it prudent to ask. And, if you'll forgive my impertinence, do you think I’ve done any lasting damage to my digestive system?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Vantine. Rebound weight gain is a concern after restrictive diets, but it’s largely preventable with a slow and gradual reintroduction of calories. It’s important to focus on a balanced diet, rich in nutrients, rather than simply going back to your previous eating habits. As for lasting damage to your digestive system… it’s unlikely that you’ve done any permanent damage, but your gut microbiome has likely been disrupted. That’s why it’s important to focus on consuming foods rich in probiotics and prebiotics, such as yogurt, kefir, and fermented vegetables. These will help restore the balance of bacteria in your gut. I’ll provide you with a handout with some dietary recommendations. Overall, I'm optimistic that you’ll make a full recovery. It's important to listen to your body, focus on nutrition, and be patient with yourself. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring, Doctor. The handout with dietary recommendations would be most welcome. I must confess, I'm rather overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information available on probiotics and prebiotics. Yogurt and kefir… yes, I believe I can manage those. No, I don't think I have any other questions at this point. You’ve addressed all of my concerns with commendable clarity and compassion. Thank you for your time and expertise. And, if you don't mind, I’d be most grateful if you could provide me with the contact information for a reputable nutritionist, just in case I require further guidance. Though, I'm hopeful that your recommendations will suffice.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I'm glad I could help. Here is the handout with dietary recommendations. I hand him a printed sheet. And here is the contact information for a reputable nutritionist in the area. I hand him a business card. I'm confident that you'll be feeling much better soon. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll follow up with you in a week once your lab results are back. In the meantime, focus on getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and listening to your body. Do you have any work restrictions that I should document?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is most helpful. I shall endeavor to follow your instructions to the letter. And I assure you, I shall resist the temptation of any further dietary experiments. As for work restrictions… no, I have no formal work restrictions. I’m retired, thankfully. My days are spent tending to my garden and occasionally dabbling in special effects for local theatre productions. Nothing strenuous, I assure you. Though, lifting a bag of cement for a prop construction can be rather taxing. But I can certainly manage that with caution. Beyond that, no restrictions whatsoever. I believe that concludes everything. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I shall see you next week.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Vantine. Glad to hear you’re retired and enjoying your hobbies! Just be mindful of that cement bag. Alright. We’ll see you next week to discuss the lab results. Until then, take care of yourself and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and enjoy your gardening. I offer a warm smile and a friendly nod.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I return the smile and nod, and make my way towards the door. .
