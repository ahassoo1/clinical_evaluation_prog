DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is... a pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm... what brings me in... yes. It is the words. They... they do not come so easy now. It is difficult to find them, you understand? Like they are hiding. It is... frustrating, at times.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty finding the right words – a frustrating feeling, definitely. It sounds like you're noticing a change in your speech. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: When it started... that is... a good question. It was... some time ago, I think. Not suddenly, not a crash, but... slowly. Like a fog coming in. Perhaps... six months? Or was it eight? It is hard to say, truly. My wife... she would have remembered. She was very good with dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually over the past six to eight months. And it's your wife who noticed it first, or she has a better recollection of when it began?
PATIENT: Yes, she... she would point it out. Gently, of course. "Sherrell, dear, are you looking for the word...?" or "What were you trying to say?" She was very patient. I... I miss her very much. It is... harder now, without her to help me find the right things to say.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Sherrell. That must be incredibly difficult. And it’s good she noticed and was patient with you. So, focusing on the words, has this difficulty been consistent over these past months, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days… better. I can speak, mostly, without too much trouble. Other days… it is like trying to pull something heavy from deep water. Slow, and… exhausting. It is worse when I am tired, I think. Or… stressed. Though, truthfully, it has been hard to not be stressed lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates, worse with fatigue and stress. That's helpful to know. And when you are having trouble, is it more difficulty thinking of the word, or more difficulty saying the word once you know what you want to say?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question, Doctor. I think… mostly thinking of it. The thinking. Like the word is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot quite grasp it. Sometimes, once I have it, the saying is alright. But more often… it is the finding. The search is the hard part. Like looking for something in a very dark room.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the primary difficulty is with word retrieval – finding the word you want. That’s good information. Now, does this difficulty affect everything you say, or are there certain types of words that are harder to find than others?
PATIENT: Certain words, yes. Names… oh, the names! I forget names all the time. And… smaller words, sometimes. Not the big, important words, but the… the little ones. Like… "thingamajig." Or… what is that one… the one you use to open bottles! It is on my mind, but… it is gone. It is not a name name, but a… a tool name.
DOCTOR: Okay, names and smaller, more common words seem to be the most challenging. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your memory other than the difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Hmm... memory... yes. It is... not as sharp as it once was, I suppose. I forget things, small things. Where I put my glasses, for example. Or what I had for breakfast. But nothing… major. Nothing that frightens me, not yet. It is just... normal aging, perhaps? My wife… she always said I was a bit forgetful, even when we were young.
DOCTOR: Okay, some general forgetfulness, which you’ve noticed for a while. And you’re wondering if it’s just normal aging. That’s a fair question. Now, have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches. Not really. Sometimes a little tired feeling, but not a headache. And no dizziness. My vision is… alright, I think. I wear glasses, as I said, but that is just for seeing far away. And no weakness. Everything feels… normal, on that front. I can move everything, and I do not feel any… dropping or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see... High blood pressure... yes, the doctor told me some years ago. I take a pill for it, every morning. And… hmm… diabetes, no, not that I know of. My heart… the doctor said it was a little big, once, but nothing to worry about too much. Just… watch the salt, he said. I try to, but… sometimes it is difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is managed with medication, and a slightly enlarged heart. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question, Doctor. I… I believe it is a small, white pill. I take it with my breakfast. I do not remember the name, truly. My wife… she always handled the pills for me. She knew everything. I just… took them as she told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, we can look it up. Ah, here we are. You’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. And it looks like you’ve been on that for about five years. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Yes. I had my appendix out… a very long time ago, when I was a young man. And… hmm… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my leg. Skiing accident. Very foolish of me. Other than that… no, not that I recall. Just the small things. A cut here, a cold there… nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken leg. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. As far as I know. My wife… she always asked me that question, every time I went to the doctor. And I always said no. I can eat anything, take anything… well, mostly. I do not like shellfish, but that is just a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had problems with memory loss, dementia, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm... family history... yes. My mother… she had some trouble remembering things towards the end of her life. The doctor said it was… old age, I think. And my uncle… on my father’s side… he had a stroke, many years ago. He never quite recovered. He couldn't speak very well after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some memory loss in her later years and your uncle had a stroke. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. Never have. My wife… she did not approve. And I… I do not drink alcohol, not really. A small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not every day. And no… no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I am a simple man, Doctor. I prefer a quiet evening at home.
DOCTOR: Okay. So no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Alright, Sherrell, that gives me a good overview. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with word retrieval, which has been gradually worsening over the past six to eight months. It’s fluctuating, worse with fatigue and stress, and it seems to affect names and smaller, more common words more than others. You have a history of high blood pressure, a slightly enlarged heart, and a family history of memory loss and stroke. Now, I want to do a brief neurological exam to get a better sense of how things are functioning. It's just a few simple tests – checking your reflexes, balance, coordination, and some cognitive function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. I am not as young as I used to be. And… I do get nervous easily. But… yes. Let us proceed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. We’ll take things slowly. First, let’s just check your reflexes. Okay, good reflexes there. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. It is… a little difficult, but I am trying. My eyes… they are not as sharp as they once were, you know. But I can follow it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and tell me if you can feel me touching your hands. Can you tell me when I touch each hand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can feel it. Left hand… now right hand… yes, I can feel both. It is… faint, perhaps, but I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I want to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that… alright? I do not want to hurt you.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Sherrell. No, you’re not hurting me. Now, can you lift both of your arms in front of you, like you’re trying to hug a tree?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… a little tiring, Doctor. I do not have the strength I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, bring them down slowly. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm... today's date... Yes. That is... August… the second. August 2nd. 2025, is it? I believe so. I try to keep track, but... it slips my mind sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we... Yes. We are... at the doctor's office. The clinic. It is… a small office, in the country, I think. It is very quiet here. Not like the city.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Please… go ahead. I will try my best. My memory… it is not what it used to be, but I will try.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: "apple," "table," and "penny." Please repeat them after me.
PATIENT: Hmm… apple… table… penny. Apple… table… penny. Did I… did I say them correctly?
DOCTOR: Yes, you did perfectly. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as 10:10. Don’t worry about making it perfect, just do your best. It is just a quick check.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I hope it is… sufficient.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherrell. Alright, that gives me a good starting point. Based on the neurological exam, you have some mild difficulties with executive function, as evidenced by the clock drawing, and some minor challenges with short-term recall. The slight asymmetry in your hand movements is something we will keep an eye on. Now, it's important to discuss the possible causes of your symptoms. Given your age, family history, and the gradual onset of these difficulties, the most likely possibility is mild cognitive impairment, possibly due to early Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. However, other possibilities need to be ruled out, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or small strokes. To help us determine the best course of action, I’m going to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other important markers. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to look for any signs of stroke or other structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. If it will help us understand… yes, please. I… I want to know what is happening. Even if it is… not good news. My wife… she would want me to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. I understand this is unsettling, and I appreciate your willingness to proceed. We will take things one step at a time. In the meantime, I want to recommend some strategies to help you manage your symptoms. Continuing to stay mentally active, engaging in social activities, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are all important. There are also some memory aids that can be helpful, such as writing things down, using a calendar, and establishing routines. I also want to discuss the possibility of a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. A neurologist can perform additional tests and provide a more definitive diagnosis. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A neurologist… yes, that sounds… wise. If you think it is necessary. I trust your judgment. And… the memory aids… yes, please. I… I forget things so easily now. It is… embarrassing, sometimes. My wife… she always helped me remember. But now…
DOCTOR: Okay. I will go ahead and submit a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here's a list of resources that might be helpful. They offer support groups, educational programs, and other services for individuals with memory loss and their families. I’ll also prescribe a Vitamin B12 supplement, as a deficiency can sometimes contribute to cognitive problems. It’s a relatively harmless intervention, and it’s worth ruling out. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I do not think so. Not at this moment. You have… explained everything very clearly. Perhaps… I will have questions later, after I have had time to think. And… after I have had the tests. But for now… thank you. Thank you for listening. And… for being so kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’re in this together, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I'll have the lab order and MRI requisition ready for you before you leave. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. I’m optimistic that we can get to the bottom of this and develop a plan to help you manage your symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Now, let's get you those orders, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes. Let us proceed. I… I trust you.
