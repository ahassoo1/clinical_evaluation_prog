DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my head gets a bit… spinny sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It comes and goes, you know? My daughter, bless her, she said I should come in. She worries.
DOCTOR: “Acting up” is rather vague, Ms. Mayhugh. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… right. Well, sometimes I just… can’t hear so good. Like things are muffled, you know? And then it’ll be okay again. It doesn’t last long, usually. And that spinny feeling… it’s like the room is moving when it’s not. It’s happened a few times now, and it scares me a bit. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s… unfortunate that you can't pinpoint the onset. These things are much easier to diagnose with a clear timeline. Has this been accompanied by any pain, discharge, or ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Oh, no pain, no. And nothing… coming out of my ears, thankfully. Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it, sometimes… yes. A little bit of a ringing. Not all the time, though. It’s faint. Like… a high-pitched whine, maybe? It goes away pretty quickly. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. My husband, he used to say I was always a bit… distracted. Not that it helps now, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any dizziness along with this… “spinny feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dizziness. Definitely dizziness. It’s not… a constant thing, thankfully. It comes with the spinny feeling, usually. Like I’m going to fall over. It makes me nervous to walk sometimes. I just have to sit down until it passes. It’s… unsettling. My sister had something like this once, I think. Something with her balance. But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhugh, you’re providing a rather fragmented history. It's making it difficult to ascertain the root cause of your complaints. Do you have any history of head trauma, recent illnesses, or changes in medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Head trauma… no, not that I recall. I was a bit clumsy as a child, maybe bumped my head a few times, but nothing serious! Recent illnesses… well, I had a bit of a cold last winter, but nothing major. And medication… let me think. Just something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. My daughter handles most of that now, to be honest. I get so confused trying to keep track of everything. It's all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. We’ll start with your ears, and then I’ll assess your balance and neurological function. Please sit up straight and let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds… sensible. Yes, I can sit up straight. Just… try not to poke anything too far in my ears, please? They're rather sensitive. And if I start to feel… spinny… just let me know, okay? I don't want to fall over.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, let's take a look at your right ear… Hmm… slight cerumen impaction. The tympanic membrane appears normal, but there is some mild redness. Now, the left ear… Similar findings. Mild cerumen impaction, some redness of the tympanic membrane. Now, please follow my finger with your eyes, but do not move your head. Good. Now, I’d like you to stand up slowly…
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I’m trying to follow your finger. It’s a bit blurry, Doctor. And standing up… that’s always a bit tricky. Whoa… okay. I’m a little… wobbly. Is that normal? Everything feels a bit… off balance. Like I’m on a boat, maybe?
DOCTOR: You do appear somewhat unsteady, Ms. Mayhugh. And you exhibit a mild nystagmus, an involuntary eye movement, which could indicate a vestibular issue. Now, please stand with your feet together, close your eyes, and keep your arms at your sides. Tell me if you feel any swaying.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Feet together… eyes closed… Whoa… oh dear. I… I think I'm going to fall. It’s… very wobbly, Doctor. I can't… I can't stand still. Everything is spinning. I need to sit down!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh, please remain seated. Your symptoms are consistent with a potential vestibular issue, possibly labyrinthitis or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo . However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to check for infection and anemia, and I'd like you to schedule a hearing test and a CT scan of your head.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A CT scan? That sounds… serious. Is it… is it bad? And blood work… I hate needles. What does all this mean, Doctor? Is something really wrong? My daughter will be so worried.
DOCTOR: Ms. Mayhugh, it's far too early to jump to conclusions. A CT scan is simply a precautionary measure to rule out any structural abnormalities. And the blood work will help us identify if there's an underlying infection contributing to your symptoms. While your symptoms are concerning, they are not necessarily indicative of a serious condition. However, given your age and the nature of your complaints, it’s prudent to investigate thoroughly. I’m also going to prescribe you some Meclizine to help manage the dizziness while we await the test results. I will also provide a referral to an audiologist for the hearing test, and the CT scan order will be sent to the radiology department. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… Meclizine… is that a strong pill? And a… audio-what? I'm sorry, Doctor, it's all a bit much to take in. I just want to feel normal again. Will this pill make me sleepy? Because I need to be able to… well, I need to be able to function. My daughter helps me with everything, but she has a life too. I think… I think I just want to go home now.
DOCTOR: Meclizine is an antihistamine commonly used to treat dizziness and vertigo. It may cause some drowsiness, but it's generally well-tolerated. We can start with a low dose and see how you respond. An audiologist is a specialist who evaluates hearing and balance. They'll perform some tests to determine the cause of your hearing loss and dizziness. Here is the prescription for the Meclizine and the referral to the audiologist. I’ve also included a list of potential side effects and instructions on how to schedule your appointment. As for your request to go home, Ms. Mayhugh, that is perfectly reasonable. However, I strongly advise you to refrain from driving or operating heavy machinery until we have a better understanding of your condition. And if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, headache, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. I just… I just want to go home. And maybe take a nap. Thank you for… trying to help me. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Mayhugh. Get some rest. And please follow up with the audiologist as soon as possible. Another vague presentation. Hopefully, the testing will yield some concrete results. .
