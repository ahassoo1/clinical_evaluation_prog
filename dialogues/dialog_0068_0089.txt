DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… my stomach, really. It’s been bothering me. A rather sharp pain, low down. It comes and goes, you see, but when it is there… it’s quite unpleasant. Honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain exactly when it started. Things do seem to blur these days. I do know it's been a few weeks, at least.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a few weeks, you said. And you describe it as a sharp pain… low down in the abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Low down… around here, if you don’t mind me pointing. It’s not constant, thankfully. More like… waves. And sometimes it radiates, I suppose you’d say. It feels like it goes… around to my back a bit. It’s hard to pinpoint. I apologize for being vague; my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's alright to be vague; we'll sort through it. Radiating to the back… okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Let me think… that is a good question. Nothing immediately springs to mind, I’m afraid. Eating doesn’t seem to affect it, nor does resting… or, well, any particular activity, really. It just… happens. Though, I do seem to notice it more when I’m… stressed, perhaps? But that could be simply because I’m more aware of my body when I'm anxious. It’s all rather confusing. I truly wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stress can certainly exacerbate things. And it’s helpful to know it isn’t reliably triggered by eating or activity. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh dear. That’s… rather a personal question, isn’t it? Well, let me see… I suppose they have been a little… irregular. Not dramatically so, but… not my usual routine, if you understand. Perhaps a bit more… frequent, and… less solid, shall we say? But it could simply be the weather, honestly. It’s been so humid lately. I wouldn't know where to begin to sort it all out.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent and less solid. We'll note that. And you are correct, weather can be a factor. Now, have you noticed any fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t believe so. I haven’t taken my temperature, but I haven’t felt feverish. Nausea, sometimes a little, but I wouldn’t say… proper vomiting, no. Just a bit queasy at times. And… blood? Oh dear. I… I haven't specifically seen blood, but… there has been a dark tinge to things, on occasion. A very dark tinge. It didn’t happen every time, mind you, and it wasn’t much, but… yes. I suppose that's blood, isn’t it? It worried me a bit, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay. A dark tinge to the stool, on occasion. That's important information, Ms. Glymph. Now, let's go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, my… the medical history. It’s a bit… lengthy, I’m afraid. Well, I was diagnosed with lupus, many years ago. Systemic lupus erythematosus, the doctor said. SLE, for short. It’s been… managed, for the most part, with medication. And… I had a bout of diverticulitis a few years back, though it cleared up with antibiotics. I’m sure there were other things, smaller ailments, but those are the significant ones that come to mind. I apologize if I’m forgetting anything; it's a struggle to recall these things accurately.
DOCTOR: Alright, lupus and a history of diverticulitis. And you’re currently on medication for the lupus, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. I’m taking… let me see… Plaquenil, I believe, and a low dose of prednisone. Though, I've been trying to wean off the prednisone, as the doctor suggested. It has… unfortunate side effects, you see. I can't quite recall the dosage at this moment, but I can provide a list from my pharmacy if that would be helpful. Honestly, keeping track of all the medications is a bit of a challenge these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. A list would be very helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Well, I recall being quite itchy after taking penicillin, many years ago. A full-body rash, it was. So, definitely no penicillin for me. And I’m a bit sensitive to… certain dyes in clothing, but that’s hardly a medical allergy, is it? Nothing else springs to mind, thankfully. I’ve always considered myself quite fortunate in that regard. Most people seem to have so many sensitivities!
DOCTOR: Okay, a penicillin allergy and sensitivity to dyes. Good to know. Now, a final question for the history, Ms. Glymph. Any family history of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or other gastrointestinal problems?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. My family… well, they weren’t always forthcoming with medical information. My mother passed away rather young from… complications, as I understand it. I don't recall anything about colon cancer specifically. My brother had some stomach trouble, I believe, but it was never properly diagnosed. He just… wasn't feeling well. It was a very long time ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to him, so I don't have much information to offer, I'm afraid. It’s a rather unfortunate topic, and I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. We'll proceed as best we can. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and then gently palpate it to see if we can identify any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Though, I must warn you… my abdomen is rather sensitive, generally. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable. And please, do be gentle. It’s a rather delicate area, you see. I do trust your judgment, of course.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though slightly… diminished. And now, palpation. Ouch. That elicited some tenderness here, on the left side. And… there's a slight guarding. Not significant, but present. No rebound tenderness. No masses palpable. Overall, mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with some guarding. I’m going to order some lab work and imaging to help us determine the cause of your pain.
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That is tender. I’m glad you found it. It's been bothering me for some time, as I said. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. What sort of lab work and imaging are you thinking of? I confess, I don't understand all the medical terminology. I hope it won't be too… invasive.
DOCTOR: No, nothing too invasive, Ms. Glymph. I’m going to order a complete blood count—that will check for signs of infection or inflammation—a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test to check for blood and infection. The imaging will be a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. That will give us a more detailed look at your organs and help us identify any abnormalities. It requires an IV contrast dye, so we will need to check your kidney function first to ensure it’s safe for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and an IV dye. Oh dear. That sounds… rather extensive, doesn't it? But if it will help determine the cause of the pain, then… yes, alright. You are quite right to check my kidney function first. I wouldn't want to cause any further complications. I do trust your judgment, Doctor. Will I need to do anything to prepare for the scan? And how long will it take? I have a… rather full schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: You will need to fast for at least four hours before the scan, and you will also need to drink plenty of fluids to help your kidneys flush out the dye. The scan itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. We’ll have you lie on a table, and the scanner will move around you. It’s painless, but you'll need to remain very still. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, in case you experience any discomfort after the exam. We’ll get the results back within 24-48 hours, and I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Are there any questions I can answer for you before we proceed?
PATIENT: Fast for four hours… and drink plenty of fluids. I can manage that. Pain reliever, that’s good to know. No, I believe that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough and patient with my questions, Doctor. I truly appreciate it. It’s comforting to know someone is taking my concerns seriously. Perhaps… perhaps we should schedule that follow-up appointment now, just to have it on the calendar? It helps me keep track of things, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. Let me see… how does next Tuesday at 2:00 PM sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM would be perfect, Doctor. Thank you very much. I suppose… I suppose that concludes our visit for today? I do hope we can get to the bottom of this pain soon. It's rather disruptive, you see. And… thank you again for your kindness. It truly makes a difference.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. We’ll do our best. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. She will explain everything. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to rest. .
