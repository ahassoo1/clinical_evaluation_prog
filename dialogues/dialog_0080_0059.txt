DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it's my speech, I think. It hasn't been quite right lately. It's hard to explain, exactly how it hasn't been right, but... it feels slurred, sometimes. I noticed it a few days ago, and my husband pointed it out too.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech that’s developed over a few days... that's definitely something we need to look into. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Honestly, it's a bit fuzzy. I think it was maybe last week? Or the week before? It wasn't sudden, not like I woke up one morning and it was just… there. It sort of crept up on me, you know? I didn't really pay attention at first, just thought I was tired maybe. It’s really hard to pinpoint a specific day.
DOCTOR: Right, creeping up on you is useful to know. And does it happen all the time, or are there specific times of day or situations when it's worse?
PATIENT: That's... a good question again. I don't think it’s constant. I feel like it's more noticeable when I'm tired, definitely. And maybe when I'm talking quickly? If I try to rush through things, it seems to get worse. It’s hard to say for sure, though. I haven't really been keeping track. My husband mentioned something about it being harder to understand me at dinner the other night, but I didn't really notice it myself at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with fatigue and perhaps when speaking quickly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the slurred speech?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... let me think. I haven't really felt sick, if that makes sense. No fever, no headache, nothing like that. I have been a little more clumsy than usual, maybe? I dropped a plate the other day, which isn't like me. And… this is going to sound strange, but my face feels a little… weak on one side? Like, it's hard to smile properly sometimes. But it could just be my imagination, honestly. I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and facial weakness... okay, that’s good information. When you say facial weakness, is it on one side specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It’s… hard to describe. It feels like the left side of my face doesn't lift as much when I smile. Like, it's a little… droopy? It’s not dramatic, not like I can’t smile at all, just… uneven. I didn’t really think much of it until now, but thinking about it, it has been happening for a few days too. It’s… subtle. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Adyn, you’re doing great. Subtle changes are still important. Let’s do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination, and look at your eye movements. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that’s alright. I don’t like feeling… off, like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to have you close your eyes tightly and I'll try to open them. Just resist me gently. Then, I'll ask you to smile, frown, and puff out your cheeks. Okay, good. Now, let's check your tongue. Can you stick it out for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. And… Here you go. Is that alright? It feels a little strange, but I'm trying to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Everything looks okay so far, but there is some mild weakness on the left side of your face, as I noticed earlier. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your arms. Just relax your arm and let it fall. This might feel a little tapping sensation.
PATIENT: Alright. Is that how it’s supposed to feel? It’s a little… odd. I hope I’m doing it right. I don't want to mess things up.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Adyn. It's perfectly normal to feel a little odd. Now I'm going to check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that alright? It feels a little wobbly, to be honest. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's a little off, but not significantly. Based on what I'm seeing, and the fact that this came on gradually, I'm concerned about a possible facial nerve issue, perhaps Bell's palsy. It's important to rule out other causes, though. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture, and I'll also want to order some blood work to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An MRI and blood work... Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best to figure out what's going on. Bell's palsy... is that serious? I've never heard of it before. I'm a little worried now, if I'm honest. But I trust your judgement. If you think that's what it could be, then I want to get it checked out properly.
DOCTOR: It's good you want to get it checked out properly. Bell's palsy itself isn't usually life-threatening, but it can cause temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It's often caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. The good news is, many people recover fully, especially if they start treatment promptly. The MRI will help us rule out other, more serious conditions that can cause similar symptoms. I’m going to write you a referral for the MRI, and the lab order for the blood work. I’ll also prescribe a short course of corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation. Let’s get those orders sent, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Corticosteroids, alright. I just want to get better, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little less worried, knowing what we’re looking for. Thank you. And thank you for writing the referrals and the prescription. I’ll get those sorted as soon as I can. When should I expect to hear back about the appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help ease some of your worries. The MRI scheduling department should contact you within 24-48 hours to set up an appointment. They'll likely need your insurance information. The lab should also contact you directly, but if you don't hear from them within a couple of days, just give them a call. I’ll also have my nurse give you some written information about Bell’s palsy and the medications I’m prescribing, just so you have something to refer to. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and avoid any strenuous activity. If you notice any worsening of your symptoms – like increased weakness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or severe pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I really appreciate your time and your patience with me. I’ll get the referrals sorted and keep an eye out for the scheduling calls. Thank you again for everything. I think I'll just… head home now and try to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. You're very welcome. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. Get some rest, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care.
