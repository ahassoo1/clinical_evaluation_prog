DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Right. Well, it's… my head. It’s been giving me trouble again. It’s not… constant, you know? Comes and goes. Feels really bad when it does come though. And I get really sweaty, and my heart races. I think that's it, mostly. It's just... unpleasant.
DOCTOR: “Unpleasant” is… descriptive. Alright. When you say “again,” has this happened before?
PATIENT: Yeah, it has. A few times now, I think. It’s hard to say how many, honestly. It feels like it’s been going on for… a while. Maybe a couple of months, off and on? I don't really keep track of that sort of thing. It just... happens. I usually just lie down until it passes. But it happened a couple of times recently, and it felt… worse. That's why I thought I should come in.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, off and on… and you say it's been worse recently. Can you describe what “worse” feels like, specifically?
PATIENT: Um… well, normally it's just a really bad headache, like a pounding. And the sweating, like I said. But lately, it feels… tighter, I guess? Like a band around my head, really squeezing. And the heart racing feels faster, and… longer. It takes longer to calm down, if that makes sense? And… I get a bit shaky, sometimes. Not a full tremble, just… wobbly. I’m not sure if that's from the headache, or… something else. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “Wobbly,” right. And this tightness… is it on both sides of your head, or more focused in one area?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Um… I think it’s mostly on both sides, yeah. Like, all over. Not just one spot. It’s not like a normal headache where it’s, you know, right behind your eye or something. It feels… spread out. Hard to pinpoint, really. I don't pay much attention to it, to be honest, I just try to get it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when these episodes happen, is there anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. I don’t think so, not really. It doesn't seem to be related to anything specific. I mean, I've had them when I've been relaxing at home, and when I’ve been, you know, busy at work. I haven't noticed any connection. Stress maybe? But I’m always a little stressed, so… that doesn’t really narrow it down. I wish I knew. It’s just random, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: “Random.” Alright. Let’s go through some other things, just to be thorough. Do you have any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, not really. No vomiting. Sometimes I feel a bit… queasy, like I might be sick, but it never actually happens. Just a bit of a stomach flutter, I guess. And definitely no… well, you know. Not throwing up.
DOCTOR: No vomiting. Any sensitivity to light or sound during these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah! Now that you mention it… yeah, definitely. Bright lights bother me. And loud noises too. I usually just want to lie down in a dark, quiet room. That helps a bit. Everything just feels… too much. It’s kind of overwhelming when it's happening.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity to light and sound. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision…? Uh… not that I’m aware of. I mean, I don’t exactly have perfect eyesight, I wear glasses, as you can see. But I haven’t noticed anything different with my vision during these headaches, or… at all, really. Everything looks pretty much the same, as far as I know. I haven’t been noticing spots or blurry vision or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mean, I had the flu a couple of times, and a broken arm when I was a kid, but nothing… serious. No major illnesses or anything. I don’t think so, anyway. I’ve never really been a big fan of doctors, so I don’t go unless I absolutely have to. So, I probably would know if I had something serious, right? I’m drawing a blank. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nope. Not a fan of hospitals, as I said. I avoid them when I can. Never needed anything… cut open or anything like that. Just the broken arm, and that didn’t need surgery. Just a cast. A really annoying cast, but still. No surgeries.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of migraines or similar headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother, she used to get headaches sometimes. Not like these, I don't think. More like… tension headaches, you know? Just a bit of pressure, not the whole sweating and heart racing thing. And my grandmother… I think she had something, but I’m not really sure what. Everyone always talked about her being a bit… delicate. But I don’t know if that was headaches, or something else. Sorry, I don’t really know much about my family's medical history. We weren’t really a talking family, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't take anything on a regular basis. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, when the headache gets really bad. Like ibuprofen or something. But not every time. Only when it's unbearable. And even then, they don’t always help. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? They always make me feel a bit… strange.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I’ve taken ibuprofen and things like that, as I said. And I eat all sorts of food. I’m pretty open to everything, really. Never had a rash or anything like that. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. I wish I could remember anything useful, sorry. I feel like I’m not helping much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs, then a brief neurological exam. Just so we can get a baseline. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. And... hopefully this doesn't take too long. I’m not a big fan of… well, you know. Examination tables. But I'll cooperate.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, relax. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 88 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Cranial nerves are intact. Now, I’m going to check your pupillary response to light. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. No obvious focal neurological deficits.
PATIENT: Okay… that didn't seem too bad. Everything feels… normal, I guess. Is that good? I mean, are those all good things you just said? I really don't understand any of that medical stuff. Just… tell me if something is wrong. Please. I’m just getting a bit anxious lying here, to be honest. Everything is starting to feel a bit tight, now. Not… the headache yet, just… tense.
DOCTOR: The exam was unremarkable, meaning I didn't find anything overtly concerning. However, given your history of recurrent headaches with associated symptoms – sweating, racing heart, sensitivity to light and sound – and the lack of focal neurological findings, my initial suspicion is tension headaches. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check for any underlying infection or electrolyte imbalances. Also, given the possibility of underlying stress, I recommend we keep a headache diary to identify potential triggers.
PATIENT: Okay… a diary, right. And… blood tests. That sounds… alright, I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. And… what if it is something serious? Is there… something I should be worried about? I know you said not to worry, but… it's just… I've had these headaches for a while, and I’m just… anxious. And what about the racing heart thing? Is that connected to the headaches? It feels really scary when that happens. I just… need to know what's going on, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, while I understand your anxiety, catastrophizing will not help. The blood tests are routine and will help us exclude more serious possibilities, such as infection or electrolyte abnormalities. The racing heart could be related to the headaches, particularly if they are migraines, but we need to rule out other causes first. I am not going to speculate about unlikely scenarios. We will address the results as they become available. I will also prescribe you a low-dose medication for occasional headache relief. Use it sparingly. I’m going to order a referral to a cardiologist to evaluate your heart rate. It's better to be cautious. Do you have any questions before I proceed?
PATIENT: A cardiologist…? Oh. That sounds… serious. Is it something really wrong with my heart? I mean, I haven’t been feeling… pain or anything. Just the racing. And you think it might be migraines? I thought migraines were… with auras or something? I don’t see any auras. Just… the headache and the sweating and everything. And… what if it isn't just stress? What if it's something else? I just… I don't understand any of this, and it's all getting a bit overwhelming. I wish I hadn’t come in, to be honest. It's just making me more anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, the referral to the cardiologist is a precautionary measure. We are covering all bases. Not all migraines present with auras. Many present with only headache, sensitivity to light and sound, and sometimes other symptoms like nausea or sweating. The racing heart is something we need to investigate further, even if you haven’t experienced pain. I understand you’re anxious, and I am attempting to provide thorough care. I will repeat: I am not saying you have a serious heart condition. We are ruling things out. I’ve ordered the blood tests, prescribed a medication for occasional use, and scheduled a cardiology consultation. We will discuss the results as they become available. Further speculation at this stage is unproductive. Do you have any specific questions about the medication or the cardiology appointment?
PATIENT: Um… the medication… is it… strong? Will it make me feel… sleepy? And the cardiologist… what will they… do? Will they poke around a lot? I don’t like being poked around. And… how long will it take to get the blood test results? I just… I really hate waiting. It makes me more anxious. And… is it possible it’s just… anxiety causing everything? Maybe I just need to relax more?
DOCTOR: The medication is a low dose, and drowsiness is a possible side effect, but it’s not common. If you experience significant drowsiness, stop taking it and contact the office. The cardiologist will likely listen to your heart, check your blood pressure, and may order an EKG, which is a non-invasive test that records your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn't involve “poking around,” as you put it. It simply involves placing electrodes on your chest. The blood test results typically take 24-48 hours. Yes, it is possible that anxiety is contributing to your symptoms. However, we need to rule out other potential causes first. Here is the prescription for the medication. Here is the referral information for the cardiologist. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I believe that’s all for today. If your symptoms worsen significantly before your appointments, go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any further questions?
