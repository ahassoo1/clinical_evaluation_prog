DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs. They bother me something awful at night. Cramps, mostly. Just… ache and tighten up. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon. I don’t rightly remember when it started, but it’s not new, that’s for certain.
DOCTOR: Right. Cramps. And how long is “a little while,” exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky question. Let me think… it feels like… several months, maybe? Possibly longer. Time does seem to slip away, you know. I used to keep better track, but… well, things aren’t as easy as they once were. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… pulling and tightening. Especially in my calves, I think. Yes, calves.
DOCTOR: Several months… vague, as usual. Do these cramps happen every night?
PATIENT: Oh, not every night, no. Some nights they’re worse than others. And sometimes I don't notice them at all. It’s hard to say. I sleep pretty soundly, when I can sleep. But when they come, they really wake me up. It’s quite unsettling. I used to try stretching, but that doesn’t seem to help much anymore.
DOCTOR: Stretching, of course. And are you experiencing any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. I suppose I haven’t noticed any swelling. My feet… they feel a little wider sometimes, perhaps? But I always thought that was just… old age. Is that something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: It is something you should be looking for. Alright. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a big question. I had a touch of the flu a few winters back, I believe. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, as you can see. And my knees… well, they ache sometimes too, but that’s just… wear and tear, I always thought. Nothing the doctor ever needed to look at before. I don’t take any regular medicines, if that’s what you’re asking. Not unless you count a little something for my blood pressure, years ago, but that doctor retired and I stopped going for a while.
DOCTOR: Years ago… of course. Any family history of blood clots or leg problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a tricky one. My family… we didn’t talk much about ailments, if you understand. My mother… she had weak ankles, I think. She walked funny, sort of. And my brother… he had some trouble with his circulation, later in life. But I don’t know what exactly. It was all a long time ago, and I wasn’t the one keeping track of things. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s just… the memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to check your legs and feet. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An examination. Yes, that sounds sensible. I hope I’m not too much trouble. It does take me a bit to get settled. And please, do let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. I’m not as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No significant swelling noted. Calves feel firm, but no tenderness to palpation. Pulses are present, though somewhat diminished bilaterally. Capillary refill is… acceptable. Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Listening to my heart and lungs, you say? I always did have a strong heartbeat, my mother used to say. Though, I suppose that was a long time ago. Please, do tell me if anything sounds… amiss. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam… it sounds like nocturnal leg cramps. It’s common, especially as you get older. We can try some simple things. Make sure you're well-hydrated throughout the day. And try gentle stretching before bed.
PATIENT: Oh, well. That doesn’t sound too dreadful. Nocturnal leg cramps, you say? Is that… serious? And hydration, yes, I suppose that makes sense. I do enjoy a cup of tea in the evenings. And stretching… I suppose I can try that again. But if it doesn't improve… what then? Is there anything else I should be doing? Something to… help them go away completely?
DOCTOR: If it doesn't improve, or if the cramps become more frequent or severe, you should see a neurologist. There are medications that can help, but they have side effects. For now, focus on hydration and stretching. And I'm going to recommend a potassium supplement, just to be safe. Here. This is a prescription for potassium. Take one tablet daily with food. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, a neurologist… that sounds… quite serious. Potassium, you say? Is that… safe? I don’t want to take anything that will… interfere with my other… well, I don’t have anything else, but… Will that interact with anything? And… how long should I try the stretching and hydration before I see a neurologist? I don't want to bother them needlessly, you see. And… …is this something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Potassium is generally safe, but you should have your kidney function checked periodically. It’s a routine precaution. As for the stretching and hydration… try it for a month. If you’re not seeing any improvement after a month, then schedule an appointment with a neurologist. And frankly, Ms. Bilstein, worrying won't help. It's likely just a benign age-related issue. Do you have any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: Oh. A month, then. And… kidney function. Yes, alright. I understand. I suppose I just… I get anxious easily. And I don’t want to be a bother. No, I don’t think that’s all, Doctor. I… I’ve been feeling a bit… forgetful lately. More than usual, I mean. It’s… unsettling. And sometimes I feel a little… confused. Is that something I should be concerned about? Perhaps that’s related to the… everything?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bilstein, forgetfulness is common with age. It’s likely nothing serious. However, if it’s significantly impacting your daily life, you should consult with your primary care physician for a cognitive assessment. But frankly, based on what you’ve told me today, it sounds like stress and anxiety. Do you have any other immediate concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. Stress and anxiety… I… I don’t have much stress, Doctor. I’m a widow, you see. I live quietly. I suppose… I just want to feel… normal again. Very well. No, I don’t think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Bilstein. .
