DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's rather obvious, isn't it? I woke up this morning and can't hear out of my left ear. And half my face feels…droopy. It’s quite alarming, really. I expect you to know what that means.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, alarming is a good way to put it. It does sound concerning. And you're right to come in immediately. Just need to gather a little more information to be sure. When did you first notice this…droopiness and hearing loss?
PATIENT: This morning. I woke up, and it was just…there. I didn't hit my head or anything, if that's what you're thinking. I went to brush my teeth and noticed my mouth wasn't moving quite right. Then I realised I couldn't hear a thing on that side. It wasn’t gradual, it just happened. Honestly, I haven’t got time for a lot of questions, doctor. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden onset. That is important. And I understand you’re busy, I’ll try to be quick. Just a few more clarifying questions, if you don't mind. Any dizziness or trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? No, nothing like that. I walked perfectly fine. Though, admittedly, I haven’t been doing much walking lately. It’s rather difficult to get motivated these days, you understand. Losing a husband does things to a person. But no, my balance is fine. Just this…this failure of my face and ear. It's terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. And I'm very sorry for your loss. Okay, no dizziness. Any pain anywhere – face, ear, head?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. It’s not painful, it's… unsettling. Like half of me doesn’t work anymore. Honestly, I find the whole situation rather distressing, not physically uncomfortable. Are we getting anywhere with this, doctor? I’d rather not spend the entire day here.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain. We are, I think. It sounds like a possible issue with a nerve…possibly facial nerve. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick examination. Just want to check your reflexes, and I’ll take a look in your ears and eyes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A nerve? Well, that sounds dreadful. Look, I’m not keen on being poked and prodded. I understand you need to do something, but please be quick about it. And explain what you’re doing, I don’t want any surprises. I have a very low tolerance for the unexpected.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No surprises. I’ll explain everything as I go. I’ll start by just looking at your face – checking for symmetry when you smile, frown, and raise your eyebrows. Then I’ll quickly look in your ears with an otoscope, just to rule out any obvious issues there. And I’ll do a simple test of your reflexes. It won't take long at all. Okay, let's start with a smile. Show me your teeth.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? As you can see, it's not exactly a picture of health. I suppose you’ve seen worse. It feels…strange. All tight on one side. Honestly, it's quite upsetting to look at.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And you're right, it is quite asymmetrical. Alright, now try to frown. Squeeze your eyes shut tightly. And then raise your eyebrows as high as you can. We're just checking how well those muscles are working.
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It’s quite exhausting, you know. I haven’t used my face this much in months. And it’s still…uneven. Are you going to tell me what this means eventually, or are you just going to make me perform for you all day?
DOCTOR: Alright, one moment. I’m just finishing up the exam. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears. This might be a little uncomfortable, just for a second. Hmm. The ear canal looks clear. No obvious signs of infection or blockage. Based on what I've seen so far, and the sudden onset, it’s strongly suggestive of Bell's palsy. It's a condition where the facial nerve gets inflamed, causing weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It's not usually caused by anything serious, but we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Bell’s…palsy? Is that contagious? And what does "not usually caused by anything serious" even mean? Does that mean it could be serious? Honestly, I dislike vague pronouncements. It sounds very alarming, even if you're trying to downplay it. What’s the treatment? And will my face…return to normal? I expect a straight answer, doctor. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your concern. No, Bell’s palsy is not contagious. It’s caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, and we don't always know the exact cause – sometimes it’s linked to a viral infection, sometimes it just happens. The good news is, most people do recover fully, often within a few weeks to a few months. However, in some cases, there can be some residual weakness. The treatment typically involves a course of corticosteroids – usually prednisone – to reduce the inflammation. We may also recommend antiviral medications. And we’ll do some exercises to help keep the muscles from getting too stiff. I'm going to write you a prescription for prednisone. It's important to start it as soon as possible. And I'll give you some information on facial exercises. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to see how you're progressing. Given your age and medical history, I also want to get an MRI to rule out any other potential causes. It's just a precaution, but it's important to be thorough. I'll need to send a referral to the radiology department. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think…no, I don’t believe so. Though, I haven’t taken anything substantial in years. Honestly, the whole thing sounds rather…involved. Corticosteroids, exercises, an MRI…it's all quite overwhelming. And expensive, I presume? I don’t have insurance, you see. This is a rather inconvenient development, on top of everything else. Is the MRI absolutely necessary? And will this prednisone have unpleasant side effects? I haven't got the energy for complications. I just want my face to go back to normal, is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and you're right, it is a lot. The MRI is a precaution, and we can discuss alternatives if the cost is a major concern. It's important to rule out other, rarer causes of facial weakness, but if it’s financially prohibitive, we can proceed with the prednisone and close monitoring for now. Prednisone can have side effects, but they’re usually manageable. Common ones include increased appetite, fluid retention, and mood changes. We’ll discuss these in detail, and I’ll write you a prescription with the lowest effective dose. Here's some information on Bell's Palsy, the potential side effects of prednisone, and some facial exercises you can start. I’m also going to write a referral for the MRI, and I’ll see if we can get a reduced rate for you since you are uninsured. I will schedule a follow up appointment for next week. In the meantime, start the prednisone as directed, and try to do the exercises a few times a day. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe pain, fever, or difficulty breathing – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Emergency room? That sounds ominous. No, I think I’ve absorbed enough information for one day. Exercises, prednisone, potential complications… honestly, it’s all rather…stressful. Very well. Schedule the appointment for next week. I suppose I have no choice. And see what you can do about the cost of that MRI, if you wouldn't mind. I trust this won't take up too much of my time next week? I have a very busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll have the receptionist schedule you for a follow-up next week, and I'll speak with the radiology department about the cost. I’ll do my best to make it as efficient as possible. It was good to meet you, Stephane. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care of yourself.
