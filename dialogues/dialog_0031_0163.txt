DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. I see you're 85 years young. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Quite right, eighty-five and still kicking, though perhaps not as vigorously as I once did. I’ve come about… well, a rather foolish experiment, I’m afraid. A diet, you see. A rather extreme one, and I’m hoping you can tell me if I’ve done myself any lasting harm. Or, if I’m simply being a silly old man.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Many people try different diets, and it’s always best to err on the side of caution. Could you tell me a bit more about this diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. It was… the “Sunlight Diet,” they called it. Utter nonsense, really, when one thinks about it logically. The premise was consuming only things that could be grown in direct sunlight. Fruits, vegetables… a few nuts, if I recall correctly. And absolutely no cooked food. Raw only. I lasted… oh, a fortnight, perhaps a little longer. I felt rather weak towards the end, and my digestion was… unsettled, shall we say. It was a friend’s daughter who suggested it. She reads a great deal of online… information.
DOCTOR: I see. A fortnight of a very restrictive diet… and you experienced weakness and digestive issues. Could you describe the digestive issues in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it wasn’t a gentle experience. A great deal of… urgency, if you follow my meaning. And discomfort. Rather cramping, lower abdominal pain. Not debilitating, but… persistently unpleasant. And, forgive me for being graphic, but my stool was… rather loose. For several days after I stopped the diet, even. It’s settled down now, mostly, but I was concerned it might indicate something more serious. One doesn’t recover as quickly at my age, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Vantine. Digestive changes are certainly concerning, and it’s wise to investigate, especially with your age in mind. You mentioned abdominal cramping and loose stools persisting after stopping the diet. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever or nausea accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor, thankfully. And no blood, at least none that I’ve observed. As for nausea… a slight queasiness on occasion, but I attributed that to the sheer monotony of the diet, rather than anything more alarming. A constant stream of peaches and tomatoes does rather lose its appeal after a few days, you see. I did feel rather… dehydrated, as well. A lot of fruit, not much substance. I’ve been drinking more water since, and that seems to have helped.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness, digestive upset with cramping and loose stools, some dehydration, and a history of a restrictive diet. And no fever or blood in the stool, which is good. I’d like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Not that I've noticed, Doctor. I maintain a fairly consistent weight, though I suspect it's trending downwards, as one would expect. I weigh myself weekly, out of habit, and it’s been remarkably stable, despite my rather limited culinary adventures of late. Perhaps a pound or two, but nothing drastic. I’m rather proud of my appetite, actually. Always have been.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Vantine. Stable weight is reassuring. Now, thinking about your medical history – do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix removed in my youth, a rather unpleasant affair, but that was… oh, seventy years ago now. And I’ve been diagnosed with mild hypertension, for which I take a small dose of medication daily. Other than that, I’m remarkably… intact, considering my age. I’ve always been fortunate with my health, to be honest. A bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing that stops me from pursuing my… hobbies.
DOCTOR: Alright, so appendectomy many years ago, mild hypertension managed with medication. And some arthritis. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s Lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily. I’ve been on it for… oh, fifteen years, perhaps a little longer. My general practitioner monitors it regularly, and it seems to be keeping things under control. No adverse effects, thankfully. I’ve always been careful to follow instructions, you see. A firm believer in the wisdom of medical professionals.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily. And you said you have some arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly in my hands, and a bit in my knees. It flares up occasionally, particularly in damp weather. I take over-the-counter ibuprofen when it’s particularly troublesome, and it usually suffices. It doesn’t interfere with my… work, thankfully. I still manage to sculpt and animate, though it takes a little longer these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I’ve always been rather… robust, so you shouldn't encounter any difficulties. Though I must warn you, my skin isn’t quite as elastic as it once was. And I do have a rather prominent scar on my left forearm, a souvenir from a youthful misadventure with a particularly temperamental piece of machinery. But other than that, proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. …There's some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, on the left side, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is otherwise soft. Finally, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems relatively unremarkable, physically. It sounds like the restrictive diet likely irritated your digestive system, leading to the symptoms you experienced. Given your age and history of hypertension, however, it's best to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: That’s reassuring to hear, Doctor. Though I do appreciate your caution. I’ve always believed in erring on the side of safety. So, what do you recommend? Do you think a stool sample is in order, perhaps? And are there any specific foods I should avoid in the meantime? Or, more accurately, embrace? I’m rather fond of a good roast dinner, you see.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Vantine. A stool sample is a good idea, to rule out any infection or inflammation. I’ll write you a requisition form for that. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet – things like rice, toast, bananas, and applesauce. Avoid anything spicy, fatty, or overly processed. And yes, you can embrace a good roast dinner – in moderation, of course. Focus on lean protein, vegetables, and whole grains. I'm also going to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, just to get a baseline assessment of your kidney function, electrolytes and to check for any signs of anemia. And, given your age and history, I think it’s wise to schedule a colonoscopy within the next six months, just as a preventative measure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A colonoscopy… preventative, you say? Well, one can’t argue with prudence. And bland food… I suppose I can manage that for a while. Rice and toast… not the most exciting culinary landscape, but needs must, as they say. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… gentle approach. Some doctors are rather… dismissive, you see. Here’s the requisition form, yes? And will you explain the process for the stool sample? I haven’t… engaged in that particular activity for some time, and I wouldn’t want to inadvertently compromise the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to explain everything thoroughly. As for the stool sample, the lab will provide you with a collection kit. It’s a fairly straightforward process. You’ll collect a small sample – about the size of a walnut – in the provided container, avoiding any contamination with toilet water. The instructions will be included in the kit, but essentially, you’ll collect the sample after a bowel movement, and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. They’ll want it within a few days, so it’s best not to delay. We'll schedule the colonoscopy for you, and I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to prepare. It’s a very common procedure, and we’ll ensure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything rather comprehensively. The stool sample… a walnut, you say? I can manage that. And the colonoscopy… well, I trust your judgment implicitly. I suppose it’s a small price to pay for peace of mind. I daresay my friend’s daughter will be rather chastened to learn that her “Sunlight Diet” required such… extensive follow-up. Though, in fairness, I should have known better. At my age, one should stick to sensible fare. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most… reassuring.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It’s always best to err on the side of caution, and I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. We'll get these tests scheduled for you as soon as possible, and we’ll follow up with the results. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you for a follow-up appointment in a week or two to discuss the results. Have a good day, Mr. Vantine.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I shall certainly do that. And I will heed your advice regarding the symptoms.
