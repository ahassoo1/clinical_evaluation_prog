DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My Harold – bless his soul – always made sure I had check-ups, but it's been a while since I decided to come. Thought I'd see what all the fuss is about. It's not like anything's wrong, you know? Just… being thorough.
DOCTOR: Thoroughness is… commendable, I suppose. Though usually people come when something is wrong. Still. Alright. Let's start with a little history. You said Harold handled your appointments?
PATIENT: Oh, he did. Everything. Bills, appointments, making sure I ate my vegetables... a real fussbudget, that one. I mostly just… showed up. I don't really remember much about what they did at these appointments, to be honest. Just poking and prodding, I think? It was all very… clinical. And I wasn't much for asking questions, never was. Harold said they knew what they were doing.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Harold's not here now, is he?
PATIENT: No, dear. He passed, oh, it must be… five years now? Six? Time just slips away, doesn't it? A good man, Harold. Very… practical. Not that I ever needed to worry about the details. He took care of everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Practical is… helpful. But you need to be aware of your own health, Ms. Calvery. Now, let's try to piece things together. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Well, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And my knees ache when it rains, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? I mean, I'm not a spring chicken anymore. Nothing serious, I’m sure. I feel… fine, mostly. A little lonely, perhaps, but that's not a medical problem, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. "Tired" and "aches." Vague, but we’ll start there. And loneliness is… a separate issue. Let's try this: any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Not really, I don't think. I eat. Soup mostly. And toast. Sometimes a little bit of fish if it's on sale. I don’t really crave anything, you know? Harold used to make me eat all sorts of things… healthy things. Broccoli, Brussels sprouts… awful. Now I just eat what I feel like. Which isn't much, admittedly.
DOCTOR: Reduced appetite, preference for soft foods. Alright. Have you noticed any weight changes recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, probably a little. I haven't stepped on a scale in ages. Clothes still fit, mostly. I'm not getting smaller, if that's what you mean. Just… comfortably shaped, I suppose. It’s not like I'm wasting away, dear.
DOCTOR: “Comfortably shaped” is… not a medical measurement, Ms. Calvery. We need to get an accurate weight. I'm going to have you step on the scale, if you don't mind. It’s important for a full assessment. And then we’ll do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose. All this fuss over a little weight. Harold would have had a fit if I went to all this trouble. He always said doctors just wanted to worry you. But… alright. Fine. Let’s get it over with. Just don’t expect me to enjoy it. It's probably broken anyway.
DOCTOR: It was calibrated this morning. Please, step on. We need to be accurate, regardless of your… preferences. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: All this bother... and for what? Probably just tell me to eat more broccoli. There. Done. Now what?
DOCTOR: 187 pounds. Alright. And your height is listed as 5’8”. That puts your BMI at… 27.3. Overweight. Now, if you’ll follow me, we’ll do a quick exam. Blood pressure first. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Overweight? Honestly. I always thought I carried myself well. Blood pressure, is it? More poking and prodding, I presume? Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. Pulse is 78, regular. Respiration is 16. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished bilaterally. Now, let's listen to your heart again. There’s a slight murmur. Not alarming, but we should investigate further. We’ll need some blood work and an EKG.
PATIENT: Blood work? An… EKG? Now you’re just trying to scare me! A murmur? What does that even mean? I feel perfectly fine! Harold always said these doctors just liked to find things wrong so they could charge more money. This is ridiculous! I think I’ve had enough of this “investigation” for one day. I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I'm not trying to scare you. These are standard procedures to assess your overall health. A murmur doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to rule out potential problems. Ignoring it won't make it go away. Look, I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, I'm acting in your best interest. We can start with the blood work. It will give us a baseline. If you’re unwilling to proceed, I will document your refusal. But I strongly advise against it. And the EKG is quick and painless. It’s a simple precaution. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work, then. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And no prodding and poking, understand? Just… get it over with. And if anything seems… unnecessary, I’m leaving. Harold would not approve of all this fuss. I’m only doing this to get you off my back. Now, where do I go?
DOCTOR: The lab is right down that hallway, first door on the left. They'll draw a few vials of blood. It will take about fifteen minutes. After that, the technician will perform the EKG. They’ll need you to lie down and attach some electrodes to your chest. Here's the form. The lab technician will need this. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Which, I recommend scheduling before you leave. Reluctant compliance with lab work and EKG. Follow-up appointment scheduled. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. Honestly, all this trouble… Harold would be rolling in his grave. Just… don’t expect me to be back anytime soon. And tell that technician to be gentle!
