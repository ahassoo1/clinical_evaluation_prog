DOCTOR: Hi Lindsey, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. My regular doctor – old Doctor Svenson, lovely man – he just told me my cholesterol was a bit high. Said I should come talk to someone about it. Hyper-what-now? He wrote it down, but I’m a bit forgetful with these things, even though I remember plenty of other stuff. It's just… numbers don't stick with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Lindsey. Doctor Svenson sounds like a good man. Hyperlipidemia – that's just the medical term for high cholesterol. It's very common, and we can definitely sort this out. So, he just mentioned it was high, or did he give you any specific numbers, even if you don’t recall them exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. He did say something about a number… started with a two, I think. And then a whole bunch of other numbers after that. He made a big fuss about the “bad” one being too high, and the “good” one not being high enough. Honestly, I was more worried about getting my flu shot scheduled than memorizing numbers! I hope that helps… a little. It’s awful being old, you know? Everything just sort of… blurs together.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable, Lindsey. Don’t worry about the numbers at all right now. We can find them here. Okay, I see your labs from July 15th. It looks like your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160, and your HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 40. Do those numbers ring any bells?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're talkin' numbers again! Two-forty-five… sixteen-oh… forty… No, no, those don’t mean a thing to me, I’m afraid. Doctor Svenson just said I needed to watch what I eat and maybe get some exercise. I’ve been tryin’ to walk a little more, but this hip… it’s not what it used to be. What do those numbers even mean? Is it bad? Am I in trouble?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindsey, absolutely no trouble at all. Let's break it down. Ideally, we want your total cholesterol under 200. Your LDL – the one we really focus on – ideally should be under 100, and HDL, we like to see that above 60. So, yours are a little elevated, especially the LDL. That doesn’t mean you're in immediate danger, but it does mean we need to take steps to lower it to reduce your risk of heart problems down the road. It's about prevention. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Prevention, huh? That… that sounds sensible. I don’t want heart problems, nobody does. My sister Ingrid, God rest her soul, she had a bad heart. So, you’re sayin’ these numbers are a warning sign? What kind of steps do I need to take? More walking? Less… what, butter? I like my butter on my toast. Is butter bad for these numbers? I'm a simple man, Doctor, and I like my routines.
DOCTOR: You’re right to think of it as a warning sign, and you're very smart to be proactive about it, Lindsey. And no, we’re not going to completely overhaul your life! Butter isn’t bad, but it’s high in saturated fat, which can raise your LDL cholesterol. We’ll talk about making some small changes to your diet – things like choosing lean meats, eating more fruits and vegetables, and maybe switching to a spread with healthier fats. And yes, continuing to walk is excellent! How far are you walking currently, and how often?
PATIENT: Well, I try to walk to the store maybe three times a week. It's only about a block each way, mind you. And I take my time! It’s mostly to get the newspaper and a few groceries. I haven’t been walkin’ as much lately, though. This hip’s been botherin’ me something awful. Feels like it’s full of gravel sometimes. And I do love my toast with butter in the mornin'. It’s a habit, you see? Been doin’ it for… oh, seventy years, maybe more! It’s a good habit, a comforting habit.
DOCTOR: Seventy years is a long time! I understand that changing habits can be difficult, especially comforting ones. And a sore hip certainly makes walking less appealing. Let's talk about that hip for a moment. Have you seen anyone about it?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t really. Doctor Svenson just said to take some over-the-counter pain relievers. And I do, you know, ibuprofen or something like that. They help a little, but it’s always just a dull ache. I figured it was just… old age. What’s the point of complainin’ to a doctor about gettin’ old? They can’t fix that, can they? Besides, I'm more worried about these numbers now. Are they really that bad? My sister Ingrid, she had all sorts of tests and procedures… I don’t want to end up like that.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious, and it’s good you're thinking about your sister's experience. And you are right, we can’t “fix” getting older, but we can manage things to help you stay healthy and active for as long as possible. Your numbers are elevated, but not critically high. We can often manage this with lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and sometimes medication. Before we talk about medication, though, let’s address your hip. I’d like to do a quick exam just to see what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. An exam… I suppose that’s sensible. I don’t like going to doctors, never have, but you seem… nice enough. And if it’ll help with these numbers, then I guess I’m willing. Just be gentle with the hip, will you? It's a sensitive area. And no poking and prodding, if you don't mind. I don't do well with poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindsey. Gentle is the word of the day. No poking and prodding, I promise. Just a quick look and feel. Could you just lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Alright then. Here goes nothin', I suppose. It’s always somethin’ with this old body. Just try not to make a fuss, will you? I don’t like bein’ fussed over. Now what?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindsey, just relax. I’m just going to feel around your hip. Tell me if anything feels particularly sore or uncomfortable. Does this feel tender?
PATIENT: Oof! Yeah, that’s a little tender. Right there… on the outside of the hip. Not awful, but… yeah, definitely tender. It feels a bit… achy, even when you’re not touchin’ it. It's been like that for a while now. It just… throbs sometimes. Especially when it’s cold. Is that bad? Is somethin’ broken? I don’t want a broken hip.
DOCTOR: It doesn't feel like anything is broken, Lindsey. It's likely some osteoarthritis, which is just wear and tear on the joint. It's very common with age, and it explains the ache and tenderness. We can get an X-ray to confirm, if you’d like. Can you bend your knee up towards your chest like this?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… that's a bit stiff. Not as easy as it used to be, I can tell you that much. It feels… tight. Like somethin’s pullin’. And it doesn’t go up very high. I used to be able to do a proper knee bend, you know, for my grandkids. But not anymore. It’s just… old age, I guess. Everything gets stiff. Is that bad for the cholesterol too? Do stiff joints mean high numbers? I'm gettin' all confused now.
DOCTOR: It's not unusual to have decreased range of motion with age, and the stiffness you're experiencing is consistent with some arthritis. No, stiffness doesn't directly cause high cholesterol, Lindsey. But being less active because of the pain can contribute to it. Okay, so to summarise, your cholesterol is elevated, and you have some tenderness and decreased range of motion in your hip, likely due to osteoarthritis. We can get an X-ray of your hip to confirm the arthritis if you’d like, and we can discuss options for managing the pain. Then, we can talk about a plan to address your cholesterol. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. An X-ray… alright, I suppose. If it'll help figure out what’s goin’ on with this hip, then do it. And a plan… yes, a plan is good. I like havin’ a plan. What kind of options are there for the hip? Pills? Injections? I don’t like the sound of needles. And for the cholesterol… what kind of things am I lookin’ at here? Strict diets? Lots of exercise? I’m an old man, Doctor, not a marathon runner. Just lay it all out for me, nice and slow. No medical mumbo jumbo, please. Just plain English.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindsey. No mumbo jumbo, I promise. Let’s start with the hip. For osteoarthritis, we have several options. Pills like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. We can also consider a cortisone injection, which can provide more immediate relief, but it’s not a long-term solution and we don’t want to do those too often. Physical therapy can also be very helpful to strengthen the muscles around your hip and improve your range of motion. As for surgery, that's usually reserved for more severe cases. Now, for the cholesterol, the main things we focus on are diet and exercise. You don't need to become a marathon runner! Even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. We’ll focus on eating lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limiting saturated and trans fats. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, we can also consider medication. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs, but we can discuss those later if needed. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Hmm. Pills… I suppose I can manage pills. I already take a few for my blood pressure. Injections… not so keen on those. And physical therapy… well, that sounds like work. But if it’ll help with this hip, I’m willing to give it a try. 30-minute walks… that sounds doable. I can walk to the store. So, no strict diets? Just… eat a bit better? And no marathon running? Good. That’s a relief. I'm too old for marathon running. Okay, let's start with the X-ray. And then… tell me more about this physical therapy. What exactly does that involve? And is it painful? I don’t do well with pain, Doctor. At all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's a great start. Let's get the X-ray ordered. It’ll give us a clearer picture of what's going on with your hip. As for physical therapy, it involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your hip and improve your flexibility and range of motion. The therapist will work with you to develop a personalized plan based on your needs and abilities. It can be a little uncomfortable at times, especially at first, but it shouldn't be painful. They'll start slowly and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. They'll also teach you exercises you can do at home to continue making progress. There is a very good physical therapy clinic just down the street. I can give you a referral. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A referral would be great. I don't like fillin' out lots of paperwork, so if you can do that, that'd be wonderful. And then… what about this cholesterol? Should I start tryin' to eat better right away? Is there anything specific I should avoid? I like my toast with butter, you know. And I have a fondness for a good sausage now and then. I don't want to have to give up all my favourite foods. Is that possible? Just… a little moderation?
DOCTOR: Here you go, Lindsey. That’s the referral. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. And yes, you can absolutely still enjoy your favourite foods! It’s all about moderation. Try to limit saturated and trans fats, which are found in things like butter, sausage, and fried foods. Lean meats like fish and chicken are better choices. And focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. We can talk more specifically about your diet at your next appointment, but for now, just try to make a few small changes. It’s a marathon, not a sprint, you know?
PATIENT: A marathon, not a sprint… I like that. Old age has taught me a lot about patience, you know. Alright then. I think I’ve got a good handle on things now. Physical therapy, a bit less butter, more vegetables… and no marathon running. When should I come back for another appointment? And is there anything else I should be doin’ in the meantime? Any tests? Anything I should be lookin’ out for? Just give me the plain English version, Doctor. No medical mumbo jumbo, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindsey. No mumbo jumbo, I promise. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for about six weeks from today. That will give you time to start physical therapy and make some changes to your diet. In the meantime, just focus on those two things. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or weakness on one side of your body, please call immediately. Otherwise, just listen to your body and take things slow. We’ll check your cholesterol levels again at your next appointment to see how you’re doing. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explainin’ everything in plain English. It’s nice to have a doctor who doesn’t talk down to me. Alright then. I’ll see you in six weeks. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindsey. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your next appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in six weeks. .
