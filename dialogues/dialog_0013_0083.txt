DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda MorenoMartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor MorenoMartinez, it’s about a little… encouragement, you could say. I just need a card. A “Get Well” card. My niece, she thinks I need one. Honestly, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. But she worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, just to be clear, your niece is concerned and thinks you should have a note for school or work, even though you feel well?
PATIENT: School? Work? Doctor, I am retired. Been retired for… a good while now. And I operate boilers. Stationary engineers, that’s what we are. Important work! Not… school. She just likes these little things, this niece. A card. That’s all. A simple “Get Well” card from a real doctor. Makes her happy, I suppose. Medicare will cover it, right?
DOCTOR: Right, I see that you’re on Medicare. And you’re retired, operating boilers – that is important work! My apologies for the confusion. However, Medicare typically covers medically necessary services, like examinations or treatment. A "Get Well" card for reassurance purposes wouldn't usually fall under that coverage. But, let’s do this: I’m happy to document a quick wellness check, just to be thorough and make your niece feel better. We can go through a few basic questions and I can note that everything appears well. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: “Appears” well? What does that mean, Doctor? I am well! And you want to write that I only appear well? That sounds… insulting, honestly. Look, I don't need a whole examination. Just a card. A simple signature. It shouldn’t be complicated. Is this really what it takes to get a little piece of paper these days? Honestly, the paperwork… it’s always the paperwork.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, it shouldn’t be complicated. And I apologize if I’m making it seem that way. It's just my professional responsibility to ensure I have a reasonable understanding of your health status before providing any documentation, even a simple note. What I mean by “appears well” is that, if we quickly go over a few questions – just things like how you’ve been sleeping, any changes in your energy levels, things like that – and everything sounds normal, I can confidently document a wellness check and sign the note. It’s more for my record, and to protect both of us, frankly. It won't be a long process, I promise. Would you be willing to answer just a few questions?
PATIENT: Questions. Of course. Always questions. Fine, Doctor. Ask your questions. But make it quick. I have things to do, you know. Important things. And don’t expect detailed answers. I’m a practical man, not a… a storyteller. Start asking, then. And try not to make me repeat myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, I appreciate your patience. Let’s start simple. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats in the past month?
PATIENT: Fever? Doctor, it’s August. It’s hot! Of course I’ve felt warm. But not a fever. A normal, sensible warm. I operate boilers, remember? It's a warm job! What kind of question is that? Next. Don't waste my time with silly things.
DOCTOR: Okay, understood. How about any cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Cough? Chest pain? Doctor, I tell you, I am a stationary engineer. I don’t run around. I operate machinery. I sit. Mostly. A little walking, yes. But no running, no heavy lifting, no… coughing fits. I breathe perfectly fine, thank you very much. This is ridiculous. Are you a doctor, or a… a question asker?
DOCTOR: Alright. How about any changes in your bowel habits or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Now you’re just being… personal, Doctor. Really. I am here for a card, not a… a medical examination of my… everything. Are you always this thorough for a simple “Get Well” note? I think I’ve had enough questions. Honestly, this is preposterous. Get me the card, please. I’m wasting my time here. And my niece is going to be very disappointed if I don't return soon. Medicare is covering this, correct?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. This is not an appropriate line of questioning for the reason you are here today. I apologize for pushing the issue. It’s a habit, honestly. I get focused on a thorough assessment. Let’s do this. I will document a brief wellness check based on your statements that you feel perfectly fine and have no concerning symptoms. I can sign the note for your niece. As we discussed, Medicare doesn't typically cover the cost of a note like this, but there won't be a charge for the quick check I’m doing today. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Finally. That’s all I asked for. A simple card. And no charge, you said? Good. That’s good. Just… get it done, Doctor. My niece will be relieved. And I have things to do. Important things. A man has to have things to do. Now, where do we sign?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let me just print the note and I’ll sign it. It will only take a moment. Here you go, Early. A signed wellness check note for your niece. I hope she feels reassured. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you. And… thank you for finally understanding. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Early. Take care, and have a good day. Feel free to reach out if you ever do have any health concerns. .
