DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 41 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. I am here because… well, I’ve gained weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s quite sudden, really. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine.
DOCTOR: I see. Sudden weight gain, despite no alterations to your lifestyle. Very well. To help me understand the situation more thoroughly, could you quantify this weight gain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… approximately 15 pounds, I would say, over the last three months. Perhaps a little less, but that feels about right. I weighed myself just last week, and it was… concerning. It’s not just the number, Doctor, it’s how quickly it happened.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds in three months... and you state no changes to your dietary intake or exercise regimen. Hmm. To rule out any obvious underlying causes, let’s begin with a brief review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. No ongoing conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. My husband always says I’m as strong as an ox, though perhaps not right now… But truly, nothing diagnosed.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have there been any significant changes in your family’s medical history recently?
PATIENT: My mother… she was diagnosed with high blood pressure about five years ago, and my father has always had slightly elevated cholesterol. But nothing dramatic, nothing that would… explain this, I wouldn't think. They are both doing alright, as far as I know. Is that relevant, Doctor? I'm not sure I understand what you are looking for.
DOCTOR: It is relevant to establish patterns, Ms. Selbitschka. While your parents' conditions may not directly correlate, family history can sometimes provide clues. Now, let's discuss your social habits. Do you smoke, consume alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don’t smoke, haven’t touched a cigarette in my life. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – maybe once a week, if that – but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. My husband would have a fit! I assure you, a very strong fit. I live a very… ordinary life, Doctor. A quiet life.
DOCTOR: Ordinary, you say. Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Not even vitamins, usually. I tried a multivitamin a few years ago, but I couldn't remember to take it regularly. Honestly, I’m terrible at remembering things like that. But no prescriptions, no over-the-counter remedies, nothing. Just… plain old me, and lately, a heavier version of me.
DOCTOR: You state you have trouble remembering things?
PATIENT: Well, not trouble, exactly… more like… I don’t always recall details immediately. Small things, mostly. Dates, names… things like that. But I can recall… well, I remember everything about my wedding day, for example, perfectly. And I can tell you exactly what I ate for breakfast three weeks ago last Tuesday. It’s just… not a consistent issue. Is that… concerning, Doctor? Perhaps it's related to the weight? I'm starting to worry.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Selective memory recall, you say. Interesting. Now, Ms. Selbitschka, let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None at all. Not a single one. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything, thankfully. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My husband always jokes I have a cast-iron stomach. He’s very funny, my husband. But truly, no allergies. It's just this weight, Doctor. It feels so… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Selbitschka, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. I’ll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please step onto the scale for me, if you would. And, if you don’t mind, a blood pressure reading will be necessary.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I do apologize for taking up your time. I know you have other patients. I just… I’m hoping we can figure out what’s happening. It's just so strange.
DOCTOR: 83 kilograms. And your height is recorded as 155 centimeters. That gives us a Body Mass Index of 34.3, which falls into the obese category. Blood pressure is elevated at 145 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Now, given your weight gain, elevated blood pressure, and some tenderness in your abdomen, I would like to order some laboratory tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… extensive, Doctor. Is that… is that serious? I understand you need to do what you need to do, but… I've never had blood tests before. And what does all that mean? Is it something to worry about? I'm not very good with medical things, as you've probably noticed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Selbitschka, while I understand your apprehension, these tests are standard procedure to rule out potential underlying causes for your weight gain and elevated blood pressure. A complete blood count will assess your overall health, a comprehensive metabolic panel will evaluate your kidney and liver function, a lipid panel will check your cholesterol levels, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level will assess your thyroid function. It does not necessarily indicate a serious condition, but it is important to have a complete picture before we proceed. I will order these tests now, and you can have your blood drawn at the lab across the hall. Once the results are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions about the process of having your blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so... I suppose not. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will you explain everything to me then, in plain English? I don't want to be left wondering, Doctor. It's just… it's a lot to take in. I appreciate you taking the time with me, Doctor. I really do. And thank you for explaining it, even if I didn't quite understand everything.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 48 to 72 hours. I assure you, I will explain everything in a manner you can understand. Here is the requisition form for the blood tests. Please take this to the lab across the hall, and they will draw your blood. Once the results are in, my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. I… I suppose I will go to the lab now. I do hope everything is alright. .
