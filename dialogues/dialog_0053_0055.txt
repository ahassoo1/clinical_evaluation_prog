DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Rannells. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. I’ve always been a very… traditional woman, but she says it might help, and frankly, the pain is becoming quite bothersome. I thought I’d just see if I could get a… certificate, or whatever it is, to see if it’s worth the trouble.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, yes. Right. Well, it's… becoming more common, I suppose. Before we discuss a “certificate,” as you put it, we need to establish if it's even appropriate for your specific situation. You mentioned arthritis. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s mostly in my hands and knees. Started years ago, a little ache here and there, but now… now it’s a constant throbbing. Makes it hard to, well, do things. Knitting, mostly. I used to knit lovely things for the grandchildren. Now… now I drop the needles half the time. And the pain keeps me up at night. I’ve tried those over-the-counter remedies, you know, the creams and pills, but they don’t seem to do much good anymore. Honestly, I don’t even want to take those strong prescription ones. Dreadful side effects, I hear.
DOCTOR: Alright, so chronic pain in your hands and knees, impacting your daily activities, particularly knitting. And you’ve tried over-the-counter medications without significant relief, and you’re understandably hesitant about stronger options. That’s… sensible. Now, just to get a better picture, has a doctor actually diagnosed you with a specific type of arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor Ramirez, lovely man, retired now, bless him. He said… hmm… osteoarthritis, I believe it was. Years ago. He gave me some exercises, but… well, let's just say I wasn’t very good at keeping up with them. It wasn’t a pleasant experience, if you understand. All that stretching and bending… Not very dignified for a woman of my age. I just wanted something to fix it, not more aches! He certainly prescribed something for the pain, but I don’t recall the name. It didn’t help much, and I stopped taking it. Frankly, I've just been managing it on my own since then.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis, alright. And you’ve tried medication previously with limited success. I understand your reluctance to pursue more exercises, and that's… perfectly reasonable. It sounds like you've been coping with this for a long time. Now, before we even consider medical marijuana, I need to do a quick physical exam, just to assess the extent of the arthritis and rule out anything else that might be contributing to your pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. I’m not terribly fond of doctors poking and prodding, but I understand it’s necessary. I just hope it won’t take too long. I have a luncheon planned with my book club this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late. We’re discussing a rather scandalous novel, you see. I wouldn't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll be as quick as possible. It won't be anything extensive. Just a basic assessment of your range of motion, some palpation to check for tenderness, and a look at your joints. If you could just sit here on the examination table, and we'll start with your hands. Please, relax, and let me know if anything causes you discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well. I must say, Doctor, this all feels a bit… unnecessary. I’ve been living with this pain for years, I think I have a pretty good idea of what hurts. But if you insist… just be gentle, please. These hands are quite valuable, you know. I have a reputation for fine needlepoint.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Rannells. We'll be very careful. Alright. Some crepitus noted in the metacarpophalangeal joints, and mild tenderness to palpation. Range of motion is somewhat limited, particularly with flexion. And… yes, again, tenderness here on the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger. We’ll move onto the knees now. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite uncomfortable. My knees have never been the same since that unfortunate incident on the cruise ship. Fell on the dance floor, you see. Dreadful music, really. No sense of rhythm. Just get it over with, please. I have a feeling this is going to take a very long time. And I really must be at my book club this afternoon. They’re counting on me to bring the scones.
DOCTOR: Right. Some swelling and tenderness present in both knees. Range of motion is limited, particularly with flexion and extension. Crepitus noted on palpation. It does appear there is some chronic inflammation. Now, Ms. Rannells, I must be frank. While I understand your desire for an alternative treatment, medical marijuana is not a “cure-all.” It may provide some symptomatic relief, but it won't reverse the arthritis. And, given your age and lack of experience with these types of medications, we would need to proceed with extreme caution. I would need to see you for a more thorough evaluation and we may want to consider other options first. Have you ever considered physical therapy, or perhaps some low-impact exercises like swimming?
PATIENT: Swimming? Oh, goodness, no. I haven’t been in a swimming pool in… well, decades. All that chlorine, and the… the exposure. Not very dignified. And physical therapy… the last time I tried something like that, the young man kept trying to get me to do things I simply couldn’t do. It was quite humiliating, really. I’m simply looking for a little relief, Doctor. A little something to take the edge off. My daughter assures me this marijuana… this medical marijuana… can do that. I don’t want a miracle, just a little comfort. Frankly, I’m not sure what all the fuss is about. It’s a plant, isn’t it? People have been using plants for medicinal purposes for centuries.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Rannells, you are correct. Plants have been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. However, medical marijuana carries its own set of risks and potential side effects, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions. And it interacts with other medications, which you haven’t told me you’re currently taking. Before we discuss the possibility of a “certificate,” I need a complete medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, aside from the osteoarthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, Doctor, are you going to quiz me on my entire life now? Well, let me see… I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back. And my blood pressure sometimes gets a little high when I’m… agitated. My daughter worries about it, you see. And I have a touch of… what is it called? Oh, yes, tinnitus. A ringing in my ears. It’s quite bothersome when I’m trying to read. But really, nothing serious. I’m a remarkably healthy woman for my age, if I do say so myself. And I do say so myself. Honestly, I’m not sure what all this fuss is about. A little pain relief, that’s all I’m asking for. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Right. History of the flu, occasional hypertension, and tinnitus. It’s important to note that hypertension can interact with certain cannabinoids. And while tinnitus isn’t directly contraindicative, it's important to be aware of any potential exacerbation of symptoms. Ms. Rannells, I’m not trying to be difficult, but I have a professional obligation to ensure your safety. Before I even consider recommending medical marijuana, I need a more thorough understanding of your overall health status. And frankly, given your limited medical history and your… reluctance to pursue conventional treatment options, I'm not entirely convinced it’s the right course of action. Perhaps we should start with a referral to a rheumatologist for a proper assessment of your arthritis and discussion of alternative treatment options. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist? Oh, goodness no! I have absolutely no desire to be poked and prodded by another doctor! I’ve already been examined, thank you very much. Honestly, this is becoming quite ridiculous. My daughter specifically told me about this marijuana… this medical marijuana… as a solution. She said it could alleviate my pain without all the fuss and bother of prescription medications or… specialists. I came here for a certificate, Doctor, not a lecture on rheumatology. I think… I think I’ll just go home and discuss this with my daughter. I’m not sure this is the right place for me. And frankly, I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon that should be spent with my book club.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Rannells. I respect your decision. However, I must advise you again that medical marijuana is not a risk-free treatment, and proceeding without a proper medical evaluation could be detrimental to your health. Here is some information on managing your arthritis symptoms. Please, consider discussing it with your primary care physician. Have a good day, Ms. Rannells.
