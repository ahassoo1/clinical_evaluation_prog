DOCTOR: Alright. Liza Sugino, 47 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Memmolo. Well, it's...it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I've been thinking about trying mindfulness or meditation. I keep hearing good things, you know? I just feel…scattered sometimes, and I thought maybe it could help with that. I don't really know where to start, or if it's even right for me.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, mindfulness. I think that's what it’s called. A friend of mine, Anya, she does it. She says it helps her with stress, and just…being present. I feel like I'm always thinking about what I need to do next, or worrying about something that already happened. It’s tiring, honestly. I saw an article online too, about how it can help with…well, everything, practically. But I thought I'd ask you first, since you're a doctor and all. Is it…safe? Is it even a real thing, or just a fad? I don’t want to waste my time if it's not going to help.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s… not typically something patients come to me about. We deal with… actual medical conditions, not… feelings. Still. I suppose it doesn't pose a direct physical risk. But wasting time on… subjective practices when there are real issues to address?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I didn't mean to…I just wasn’t sure where else to ask. I thought maybe you’d have some resources, or know someone who could recommend a good class. I do have Medicare, so I was wondering if perhaps there was anything covered that might be related? I’m not expecting a miracle cure, just…something to help me feel a little more grounded, you know? It's just...work is stressful, and being alone can be difficult sometimes. It's nothing major, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Medicare…covering mindfulness?
PATIENT: I didn't know if they did, honestly. Anya said some places offer group sessions, and I just thought…maybe? It was a long shot. I really wasn't sure what to expect coming here today. Perhaps I should have just asked Anya for advice. I apologize for taking up your time with something so…unconventional. It's just that I trust doctors, you know? I thought you might have some insight. I’m happy to drop it if it’s not something you deal with.
DOCTOR: There is some coverage for behavioral health integration…but it’s usually related to diagnosed conditions. Depression, anxiety…not simply “feeling scattered.” Honestly, it sounds like you need a hobby, not a medical intervention. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s…disappointing, I suppose. A hobby…you might be right. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had the energy lately. I'm just…tired all the time, even when I sleep enough. But I didn’t think it was anything serious enough to bother a doctor with. It just feels like…life, you know? Maybe I am just overthinking things. No, I don’t have any other concerns. Just the feeling scattered thing. And the tiredness. But I don't want to take up more of your time, especially if it's not something you can help with. Thank you for looking into it, though. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's at least take a basic look at your vitals. We'll rule out anything glaringly obvious. It’s a waste of both our time if you're simply…unmotivated. Please step on the scale. And then we'll check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to do that. There we go. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, to be honest. It's probably higher than I think. I tend to...comfort eat when I'm stressed. But I'll try not to dwell on it. Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: 136 pounds. And your height is 161 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 161 centimeters. I'm not very tall, I know. My mother was petite too. It runs in the family, I suppose. Ready when you are. I hope it's not too high. I get a little nervous at the doctor, which probably doesn't help.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. Elevated. And your pulse is 88. Not dangerously high, but…concerning, given your reported fatigue and stress. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? No, I haven't had any chest pain or shortness of breath. No dizziness either, thankfully. Just…tired. And a little overwhelmed, I suppose. It comes and goes. I do have a bit of a headache sometimes, but I usually just take some paracetamol for it. It's probably just tension, from worrying. I haven’t changed anything in my diet lately, and I sleep a good seven or eight hours most nights. I do drink coffee, though. A couple of cups in the morning. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Coffee, fatigue, elevated blood pressure…It’s unlikely simply caffeine, but it is contributing. We need to rule out other causes. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension before?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never had any serious medical issues, honestly. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing major. My mother had some arthritis in her later years, but that was about it. I've always been relatively healthy, which is why this is a bit…concerning. I don't take any regular medication, just the paracetamol for headaches when I need it. I suppose that's why I didn’t bother coming in sooner. I just assumed it was stress, or lack of sleep. Or too much coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll run a basic blood panel. Cholesterol, kidney function, thyroid… standard procedure. And I want an ECG, just to rule out anything cardiac. It's…unlikely, given your age and history, but we must be thorough. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies. Not to my knowledge, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything before. Blood tests…and an ECG. That sounds…extensive. But I understand. It’s better to be safe, I suppose. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare. And thank you for taking the time to investigate this properly. I appreciate it. It’s just…a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the procedure. No preparation is necessary. It’s a standard workup. We'll see what the results tell us. Don't get ahead of yourself. It's likely nothing serious. But we must rule out underlying causes. I’ll have the nurse come in now. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. I will…wait for the nurse then. .
