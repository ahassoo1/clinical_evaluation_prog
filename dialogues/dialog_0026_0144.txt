DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Lilly. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Finco, is it? Yes, yes… well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My Harold – my husband, bless his soul – always liked to keep up with things. Newfangled tests and all that. I figured I should probably see what all the fuss is about. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor, you know? Not feeling ill, just… checking in.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Lilly. Preventative care is always a good idea, and it’s wonderful you're thinking about your health. Harold sounds like a wise man. So, just to be clear, you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness no. Not really. Everything… feels about as good as it's going to at my age, I suppose. A little creaky in the mornings, but that’s just getting old. I mean, I can still manage the garden, and I still bake a decent apple pie. That's what matters, isn't it? Don't need a doctor for a little stiffness.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear! Staying active and enjoying life is wonderful. But even without specific complaints, it’s good to get a baseline and make sure everything is functioning as it should be. It helps us catch things early, should they arise. Let's just go through a quick review of your general health then. Have you had any major medical issues in the past – anything you've been treated for, or surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're asking… Harold always handled all that paperwork. I think I had my tonsils out when I was little. A very long time ago. And… there was a hysterectomy, I believe, but honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. It was… well, a long time ago. Before we moved here, definitely. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. Silly thing to do, really. But that’s about all I can recall. Nothing serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that, Lilly. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the details; we have some information here in your chart as well. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I used to get a little itchy when I ate strawberries as a child, but I grew out of that, I believe. Nothing that needed any… you know, shots or anything. Just a little rash sometimes. Harold always said I was a tough old bird. Didn’t bother me much. No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I take a little something for my blood pressure. The little white pill. Harold used to fill it for me. Now… my daughter, Susan, does it. It's… I think it's Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it’s really bothering me. That’s about it, I think. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilly. That’s helpful. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be quite old, I think. Eighty-something. But she wasn’t much for talking about health. My father… he had heart trouble, I believe. Yes, that’s right. Spent some time in the hospital. And… Harold’s mother had something with her… her memory, I think. Getting forgetful, like. Not as bad as me, though!
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your father and some memory issues in Harold's mother… that’s good to know. And to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I try to stay busy. I have a small garden – tomatoes, peppers, a few herbs. And I bake, of course. Apple pies are my specialty. I don’t go out much anymore, to be honest. Susan takes me to the grocery store and the occasional church service. I used to be quite the dancer, you know. Before my knees went bad. Now… I mostly sit and watch television. And read. Mysteries are my favorite.
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant, Lilly. Staying engaged is wonderful. And just to round things out, have you ever smoked, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, never smoked a day in my life. Harold always said it was a silly habit. And… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass, mind you. Haven't had one in ages, though. Susan doesn't approve. Says it interacts with my blood pressure pills. She worries too much, that girl. But she’s a good daughter.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very caring daughter. Alright, Lilly, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have my book in my purse, you know. I’m right in the middle of a rather good mystery. But, yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilly. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good airflow on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. All right, Lilly. That's a quick overview. Given your family history and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order a few blood tests just to get a baseline. We'll check your cholesterol, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… Well, if you think it’s necessary, dear. Harold always said it was best to be thorough. But I do hate needles. Susan will probably have a fit about having to take me. She’s very protective, you know. But, alright. If it will give you peace of mind… yes, go ahead and order the tests. Just… try to make it quick, alright? And tell Susan to be ready to drive me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilly. We’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll write the orders now, and the lab will contact Susan to schedule an appointment. We'll also discuss the results when they come back, usually within a week. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your current medications and staying active as much as you can. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm. I suppose… Is my memory getting worse? Susan keeps saying I repeat myself. And sometimes I forget where I put my glasses. It’s very frustrating. Is there anything I can do about that? Or is it just… old age?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Lilly. It’s completely normal to experience some memory changes as we get older. It’s often due to a combination of factors, including decreased blood flow to the brain and natural changes in brain cells. Repeating yourself and misplacing things can happen to anyone, but it’s good that Susan is noticing it. There are things we can do. We’ll review your medication list to make sure nothing is contributing to memory issues. Also, staying mentally active is very important. Things like reading, puzzles, and social interaction can help keep your brain sharp. We can also discuss some memory strategies, like writing things down and using calendars. Given your concerns, and the family history, I’d also like to do a brief cognitive assessment during your next visit, just to get a baseline and monitor any changes over time. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A cognitive assessment…? Oh dear. Sounds… complicated. But alright, if you think it's necessary. Susan will probably want me to get a second opinion after that, though. She’s very thorough, you know. And… is it expensive? Harold always handled the bills. I don't want to cause Susan too much trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple test, Lilly, just a few questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It won’t be painful or frightening at all. And yes, Susan being thorough is a good thing! We can certainly discuss any concerns she has. As for the cost, it’s typically covered by Medicare, so it shouldn’t be a significant expense. Our billing department will verify your coverage and let you know if there are any out-of-pocket costs. I want to assure you, we'll do everything we can to make this process as smooth and stress-free as possible. So, to recap, we've ordered blood tests, and we'll schedule a cognitive assessment during your next visit. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Susan will probably have a list a mile long when she calls. But… thank you. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, at least. It’s nice to know someone is paying attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And tell Susan hello from me. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your book! .
PATIENT: .
