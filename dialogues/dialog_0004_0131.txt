DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s Ms. Sladen, actually. But that's alright. I'm here 'cause the nurse said my blood pressure was a little high when I came in. I been feelin' okay, mostly. Just a bit tired sometimes, but who isn't, right?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, my apologies. And yes, many people experience fatigue. But we still need to investigate this elevated blood pressure. “A little high” is relative, and we need specifics. Do you know what your blood pressure reading was when the nurse checked it?
PATIENT: Hmm, no, I don't remember the exact number. She just said it was a bit over what it should be and wanted me to see you. I didn't really ask, I just figured she knew what she was doin'. Is it somethin' I should be really worried about? I don't wanna get all stressed out over nothin'.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sladen, it's good you're here getting it checked. Stress can elevate blood pressure, ironically, but we need to determine the underlying cause. We won't jump to conclusions. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or has a doctor ever mentioned it to you?
PATIENT: No, never. This is kinda new to me. My mom had some problems with her heart when she got older, but I don't think it was blood pressure exactly. More like… a weak heart, she used to say. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat okay and I walk a bit when I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Family history is important. “Weak heart” can mean a variety of things, but we'll make a note of that. And it's good you're proactive about your health. Now, Ms. Sladen, let's get a more precise reading. I'm going to check your blood pressure myself, and then we'll ask you a few more questions. Can you please sit back and relax for a moment?
PATIENT: Sure, that sounds good. Relax… easy for you to say, Doc! But yeah, go ahead. Just let me know if it's gonna be a pinch or somethin'. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: It will be a slight squeeze, nothing more. Just try to keep your arm still and don’t talk while I'm taking the reading. Okay… 148 over 92. That is elevated. And your pulse is 78, regular. Ms. Sladen, this confirms the nurse’s initial assessment. Now, beyond feeling tired, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No headaches, no dizziness… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I wear glasses, so I just figured it was the prescription. Oh! And my ankles sometimes feel a little swollen at the end of the day, especially if it’s hot. Is that… could that be somethin'? I never really thought much of it.
DOCTOR: Blurred vision and ankle swelling are relevant, Ms. Sladen, and good you’re bringing these up. The swelling is particularly noteworthy. When you say “at the end of the day,” is it both ankles, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, usually. Not like huge balloons, you know? Just… puffier than normal. And it goes away when I sleep or put my feet up for a while. I figured it was just the heat, 'cause it's been pretty warm lately. I work on my feet a lot, so I just thought my feet were tired. I help out at my cousin’s shop, she sells flowers and gifts, and I'm on my feet most of the day arranging things and helping customers. It's not a glamorous job, but it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate you detailing your work, Ms. Sladen, it’s important we focus on the medical aspects. It’s convenient you mention working on your feet. We need to rule out several possibilities. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, kidney disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, sorry, Doc. I just thought you might wanna know why I'm on my feet all day, 'cause it might be somethin'. And no, I haven't been diagnosed with any of those things. Never. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, but nothin’ serious. I get a yearly checkup, but the doctor always says I'm healthy as a horse, mostly. Well, was healthy as a horse, I guess. Now this blood pressure thing got me worried.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, I assure you I am focusing on your medical care. A yearly checkup is good, but sometimes things are missed. We need to be thorough. Now, regarding medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. And I try to drink plenty of water, 'cause my skin gets dry easy. I don't really like taking pills, to be honest. My grandma always said they’re worse than the illness sometimes. She was a bit… old-fashioned, I guess. But no, no prescriptions or anything like that. Just the multivitamin, occasionally.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. My cousin is allergic to peanuts, so I gotta be careful around her shop, but I’m fine. No hay fever, no bee stings, nothin’. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I'm pretty lucky in that department, I guess. Although, I do get bitten by mosquitoes a lot, but that’s not an allergy, right?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Sladen, mosquito bites are not an allergy. Let’s move on. Now, regarding your family history – beyond your mother’s “weak heart,” were there any other instances of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, or diabetes in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandfather on my dad’s side had something wrong with his kidneys, I think. He was on dialysis for a while when he got older. And my aunt – she had a stroke a few years back, but she smoked a lot, so I always figured that was the cause. Nobody really talked about blood pressure much in my family. It wasn’t really a thing people worried about back then. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. They didn’t really go to the doctor much, my family. Old habits, I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I can't stand the smell of it. My mom used to try when she was younger, but she quit when I was born. Said it was bad for me. She was a strong woman, my mom. I’ve always been careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two on the weekends if I'm relaxing. Nothing crazy, Doc. I don't really need it to have a good time. Mostly just enjoy it with my food. I'm not a big drinker, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, let’s talk about your social situation. Are you currently employed, and what is the general level of stress in your life?
PATIENT: Yes, I work at my cousin’s flower shop, like I said. And stress… well, it’s a shop, you know? Busy weekends, dealing with customers, making sure everything looks nice. It’s not a terrible stress, just… regular. I get by. I have good friends, good family. I try to stay positive. It could be worse, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sladen. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. This will include listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and feeling your abdomen. It’s standard procedure. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Just let me know if it's gonna be cold or somethin'. I get chills easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sladen. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… accentuated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Pulse is still 78, regular. Now, let’s check your ankles. I noticed you mentioned some swelling earlier. There is mild pitting edema bilaterally. Based on my examination, you have some mild swelling in your ankles and slightly elevated heart sounds. I also noted an elevated blood pressure reading of 148/92 during my assessment. Ms. Sladen, these findings are concerning. We need to run some tests to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and rule out any underlying conditions. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, an EKG, and a urinalysis. These tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That sounds… serious. What could it be? Is it… bad? I don't want to have to take a lot of pills or anything. And what do all those tests even mean? I get all confused with medical stuff. An EKG... is that where they put stickers on your chest?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing your elevated blood pressure. It could be a number of things – stress, diet, genetics, underlying kidney issues, or even early signs of heart disease. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. And yes, an EKG involves placing stickers on your chest to measure the electrical activity of your heart. It’s painless. As for what the tests mean… a complete blood count checks for abnormalities in your blood cells. A comprehensive metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. A lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels. And a urinalysis checks for protein or other abnormalities in your urine. It's all quite routine, really. We need this information to provide you with the appropriate care. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample now. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I want you to try to reduce your stress levels, eat a healthy diet low in sodium, and get regular exercise. And I will not speculate about medication at this time. We need the test results first.
PATIENT: Okay. That's… a lot. Sodium? Like, salt? I put a little salt on my food. I like the taste. And reducing stress… that's easier said than done, Doc. So, the nurse is gonna draw blood now? How much blood are they gonna take? I don't like needles. Is it gonna hurt a lot? I get faint sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sladen, sodium is salt. Reducing your intake means being mindful of processed foods, fast food, and adding less salt to your meals. And while I understand reducing stress is challenging, it’s crucial for your health. Perhaps consider practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation. The nurse will draw a standard amount of blood – a few vials. You may feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you're prone to fainting, please inform the nurse, and they will take extra precautions. We have a reclining chair available if you feel lightheaded. It’s important to cooperate with the nurse so we can obtain the necessary samples. I will have her come in now. Please remain calm and try to relax. Nurse Rodriguez, could you please come in?
PATIENT: Okay. Calm… right. Easy for you to say. A reclining chair… that doesn't sound good. I hope she's gentle. This is gonna be a long week.
