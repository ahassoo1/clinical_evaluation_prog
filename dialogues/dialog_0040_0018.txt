DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Verbose. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be going to the restroom rather frequently, you see. More than usual, certainly. It’s… bothersome. I wouldn’t say painful, just… a lot. Is that what you call it, “poly-something”? I read the paper you sent, but the words… they don’t always stick with me, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Polyuria, you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Polyuria. Thank you. It’s been going on for… well, I’m not entirely sure how long. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s hard to say. Time does seem to… slip away these days. I haven’t noticed anything else, not that I’m aware of. Just the frequent trips to the bathroom. It’s… inconvenient, mostly.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient. Right. And have you noticed any changes in your thirst, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: Thirst… hmm. That’s a good question. I suppose I have been drinking a little more water, yes. Not dramatically, you understand. Just… refilling my glass a bit more often. I enjoy a nice glass of water, you see. But I wouldn’t say I’m parched, not at all. It’s probably just the weather, isn’t it? Quite warm lately.
DOCTOR: And any changes to your urine itself?
PATIENT: Urine… well, it looks normal, I think. The usual color. I haven’t… examined it closely, if that’s what you mean. I don't really look at it, not particularly. Is there something I should be looking for? Perhaps it's best if I leave the visual inspections to the professionals, don’t you think? I wouldn’t want to misinterpret anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes… now that’s a name I recognize. My mother… I believe she had something similar, yes. Though it was a long time ago. I was quite young. She… needed injections, I recall. It wasn't a pleasant time. But I don’t know the specifics. My sister might know more, if you need a name. Her name is Helena Verbova. I’m not certain if that’s helpful, though. It was many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill, once a day. And… oh, there’s a vitamin D supplement. The doctor recommended it, last winter. Something about the lack of sunshine. I don’t recall the name of either one, I’m afraid. I just take what I’m told. I have a… a container at home, with all the information. But I didn’t bring it with me today. It slipped my mind. Is that alright? Perhaps it’s not essential?
DOCTOR: It's… less than ideal. Do you drink much alcohol, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: Alcohol… not particularly, no. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on occasion. But nothing excessive. I enjoy a good Czech beer now and then, of course, but again, not regularly. I'm not much of a drinker, if I’m honest. It doesn’t… agree with me, sometimes. Mostly, I drink water. As I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick exam. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. I apologize for the lack of… precise information. As I said, my memory isn't what it used to be. Hopefully, this exam will shed some light on the matter. I do try to be helpful, you see. Just a bit… scattered, perhaps.
DOCTOR: 141 kilograms. That’s… a bit elevated. Now, if you’ll just follow me to the exam room. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh. Is that… bad? I have been enjoying my meals a little more lately, I suppose. The cooking has been particularly good. Very well, listen to the heart and lungs. And the… abdomen. Whatever is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just hope we can figure out what’s causing all this… frequent urination. It’s rather disruptive, you see.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses palpable. Blood pressure is 140/90. Your blood pressure is a little high as well, Mr. Verbose.
PATIENT: Oh dear. High blood pressure and elevated weight… It seems I’m not as healthy as I thought. I suppose I should be eating more vegetables. And perhaps… less dumplings. My sister Helena always tells me I need to watch my diet. Is this all connected to the… the urination problem, Doctor? Or is it just a coincidence? I’m getting a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It could be related. Frequent urination can be a symptom of diabetes, which can also contribute to weight gain. The high blood pressure isn’t helping. We need to run some tests. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a blood glucose test. We’ll also check your kidney function.
PATIENT: Tests… yes, of course. That makes sense. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause. A urinalysis and… blood glucose. I do try to be cooperative, you see. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Fasting, perhaps? I wouldn’t want to inadvertently skew the results. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a… a book club meeting next week, and I’d prefer not to miss it. It’s a very important discussion. About Czech literature, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 8 hours before the blood glucose test. Just water. No food or sugary drinks. The results should be back in a few days. I’ll have my nurse call you with the findings. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your sugar intake and increase your physical activity. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Eight hours… yes, I can manage that. No food… just water. Less sugar, more… exercise. I suppose I could take the dog for a longer walk. He enjoys that, at least. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. Though a bit… hurried, perhaps. But I understand you’re busy. I’ll wait for the nurse’s call. And try to remember everything you’ve told me. It’s… challenging, you see. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, have a good day, Mr. Verbose. And try to follow those instructions. .
