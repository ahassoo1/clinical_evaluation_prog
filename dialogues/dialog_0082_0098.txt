DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, to be honest… I ain’t really sick sick. Just… curious, I guess. Been meaning to get a check-up for a while now, and figured today was as good a day as any. Just wanna make sure everything’s okay, you know? I work on the boats, and it can be rough sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right, a general check-up. That’s very sensible, Demondre. Preventative care is important, especially with a physically demanding job like working on the boats. Rough work, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty rough. Lots of lifting, climbing, being out in the weather… you name it. We mostly haul stuff, fix the engines, keep the ship running. It’s good work, pays the bills, but it takes a lot outta ya. Mostly my back gets sore, but I just figured that was part of the job, ya know? Nothing I couldn't handle... usually.
DOCTOR: I see. Lifting and climbing… that certainly puts a strain on the body. Back soreness is common in that line of work, as you say. But it’s always worth checking to make sure it’s just soreness and not something more. Let’s start with a bit of a history. Have you had any injuries to your back, or any other part of your body, that you remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… injuries… not really serious ones. I pulled a muscle in my shoulder a few years back, but it healed up pretty quick with some rest and, uh, some of that cream my mom used to give me. And I’ve twisted my ankle a couple times, but nothing broken. I think. I mostly just get aches and pains, like an old man, I guess. Nothing that’s kept me from work for long, though.
DOCTOR: “Like an old man,” you say! Well, aches and pains are certainly a part of life, but we still want to get a good understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox and all that. But nothing… serious. I don’t take any regular medicine, unless you count the stuff for when I got a bad cold. I try to stay healthy, eat okay… mostly. My ex-wife always said I didn’t take care of myself enough, but… well, that’s another story.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medical conditions and no regular medications. Good to know. And you said you had chickenpox as a child?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. It was a long time ago. My mom said it was a bad case, but I don’t really remember much. Just remember being really itchy and stuck in bed for a while. Is that important, Doc? Does chickenpox matter now? I ain't been sick with it since, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: It can be, Demondre. Chickenpox can reactivate later in life as shingles, so it’s good to have that information. We’ll want to keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… that’s a tough one. My mom’s side, they mostly just get old and… well, you know. My grandma lived to be 95, but I don't really know how she did it. She smoked like a chimney and ate nothing but fried food. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And his brother had something with his heart, but I don't remember exactly what. It was a long time ago. We weren’t real close, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure and some sort of heart issue on your father’s side. That's helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a smoker. Tried it once or twice when I was younger, didn’t like it. And I don’t really drink much, maybe a beer with the guys on a Saturday night if we're feeling like it. Definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. I gotta be clear-headed for the boats, you know? Can’t be messin’ with that.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s very good to hear. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if anything stands out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good, Doc. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… uncomfortable. I ain’t real fond of needles, if that matters.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Demondre, unless we find something that requires blood work. We'll start with your height and weight, then listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your back. Alright, let’s start with height and weight. You said you’re about 6’0”?
PATIENT: Yeah, around 6’0". Maybe a little taller. And I’m usually around… 180, 190 pounds, depending on how much I’ve been eatin’ lately. It goes up and down with the seasons, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're exactly 6’0” and… 191 pounds. That's a healthy weight for your height. Now, if you’ll just have a seat on the exam table, we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad to hear that. Reflexes… what’s that involve, Doc? You gonna hit me with one of those rubber hammers? I always hated those things.
DOCTOR: Just a little tap with the rubber hammer, yes. It’s nothing to worry about. It just checks how quickly your nerves are sending signals. Reflexes are normal and equal bilaterally. Good. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Can you point to any areas where you feel pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Didn’t feel too bad. It’s mostly right here, lower back. Gets stiff and sore after a long shift, especially if I’ve been lifting a lot. Sometimes it shoots a little pain down my leg, but it usually goes away after I rest. It’s just… part of the job, I guess.
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region. No muscle spasms noted at this time. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof… that’s a little tough. Gets tighter the further I go. Feels kinda locked up, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with some discomfort on forward flexion. No radiating pain down the legs at this time. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some muscle strain and possibly some mild lower back arthritis. It’s common with physically demanding work. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a few X-rays of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays… huh. Sounds… serious. Is it gonna be expensive? My insurance ain't the best. And will it show somethin’ real bad? I just wanna make sure it’s not somethin’ I gotta worry about. I kinda just wanted a check-up, not a whole bunch of tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Demondre. X-rays are a relatively inexpensive way to get a good look at your bones and rule out any fractures or significant structural problems. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It’s just a precaution. We can check with your insurance beforehand to see what your out-of-pocket costs would be. And to be clear, I don’t expect to find anything major. But it’s always best to be thorough. If you're not comfortable with the X-rays at this time, we can explore other options, but it will be harder to determine the cause of your back pain without them. We can start with some physical therapy and see if that helps. What do you think?
PATIENT: Hmm… physical therapy sounds good. Less scary than X-rays, for sure. But if you really think it’s important to get the X-rays, I guess I can do it. Just… please tell me if it’s gonna cost a lot before you do it. I ain't got a lot of money to spare. And… uh… how long will it take to get the results? I gotta get back to work pretty soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can definitely start with physical therapy. And I promise, I will check with your insurance before scheduling any X-rays and let you know the estimated cost. We can discuss that before proceeding. If the physical therapy doesn’t provide sufficient relief, we can always revisit the idea of X-rays. Regarding the results, the radiologist typically sends the report within 24-48 hours. I’ll review it as soon as I receive it and contact you with the findings. Now, let’s get you scheduled for a few physical therapy sessions. Would you prefer mornings or afternoons?
PATIENT: Afternoons are better, I think. Mornings I gotta get ready for work. Afternoons are usually free. And… uh… is it gonna be hard? I ain’t real flexible, Doc. And I don’t wanna make things worse.
DOCTOR: Afternoons it is. And don’t worry, the physical therapist will tailor the exercises to your specific needs and limitations. They'll start slowly and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. It won't be a strenuous workout, and they’ll make sure you’re not pushing yourself too hard. Their goal is to relieve your pain and improve your function, not to make it worse. We'll start with a referral to PT. Do you have a preference for a location or therapist?
PATIENT: Nope, no preference. Whatever’s closest to my place, I guess. I live over near the docks, so somethin’ around there would be good. Don’t wanna spend all day travelin’ to get there. Just… as long as they’re good, ya know? I wanna get this back fixed. It’s startin’ to bother me more and more.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me see… there’s a good physical therapy clinic just a few blocks from the docks. They have excellent reviews. I’ll send the referral over electronically. They should contact you within a day or two to schedule an appointment. Here’s a copy of the referral for your records. It has their contact information. So, to summarize: we've discussed your history, conducted a physical exam, and decided to start with physical therapy. We’ll hold off on the X-rays for now, but we can always revisit that option if the therapy isn’t effective. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that’s it. You explained everything real good, Doc. Thank you for listenin’ to me. And thank you for not makin’ me get X-rays right away. I appreciate that. I guess I’ll go see the physical therapist and see what they say.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after your appointment with the physical therapist. Get well soon. And remember, if your pain worsens, or you experience any new symptoms, please contact us immediately. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doc. You too. .
