DOCTOR: Kia ora, Rayshun. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Kimm. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the wearing of masks and other protective equipment. My employer requires it, but…well, I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption. I have some difficulties with them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So it’s about getting a medical exemption for wearing masks and protective equipment at work. That’s perfectly reasonable. To help me understand the situation and see if an exemption is appropriate, could you tell me more about the difficulties you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to explain simply. It’s not a matter of discomfort, not exactly. It’s more…a feeling. A pressure, a tightness in my chest. It brings back…memories, Doctor. Bad ones. It makes it hard to breathe, even if the mask isn’t restricting my air. It’s a…a reaction, I suppose. It started a few months ago, when the rules became stricter at the job site. I work with the county, assisting families. It makes it hard to focus on the work when I’m feeling like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Rayshun. It sounds like this is causing you significant distress, and it's good you're addressing it. It sounds like there might be a psychological component to this reaction – perhaps related to past experiences triggering anxiety when wearing a mask. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about these “bad memories”?
PATIENT: It’s…a long story, Doctor. And not a pleasant one. I grew up on the reservation, and things were…hard. There were times when we were sick, very sick, and the only people who wore masks were the ones…taking things from us. Taking our children to school, taking our elders to the hospitals. It was…a symbol of loss, of control being taken away. I don’t mean to sound…difficult. It’s just…when I wear a mask, it brings all those feelings back. The fear, the helplessness. It feels like…suffocating, almost. It’s not the mask itself, but what it represents. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Rayshun. Thank you for being so open and sharing that with me. That's a very powerful and understandable association, given your experiences. It sounds like this isn’t just a physical discomfort, but a deeply emotional response tied to trauma. Just to clarify for my records, and to make sure I understand the timeline: this reaction started after the mask requirements at your work became stricter a few months ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Before that, masks weren’t a frequent thing. A little here and there, but nothing that caused me concern. It was when the county made it mandatory, and it became…constant, that the feelings started. It was subtle at first, a little unease. But it grew steadily worse each week. Now…now it’s difficult to even think about putting one on without feeling anxious. It interferes with my ability to do my job, and I don’t want to let the families I assist down.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And to confirm, when you experience this anxiety, are there any other symptoms you notice?
PATIENT: Yes, there are, Doctor. My heart races, and my chest feels tight, as I mentioned before. But it’s more than that. I get…shaky. My hands tremble, and it’s hard to concentrate. I feel lightheaded sometimes, almost dizzy. And I…I get very tired afterward. It’s like all my energy is drained away. I also find myself…reliving the memories, Doctor. Seeing things, feeling things from the past. It’s unsettling, to say the least. It makes it hard to sleep some nights. I try to ignore it, but it's difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that, Rayshun. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant anxiety response with both physical and emotional symptoms – racing heart, chest tightness, shaking, dizziness, fatigue, and even some flashbacks. That's important information. To help me get a complete picture, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or any other mental health condition in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve never sought treatment for anything like that. Growing up, we didn’t…talk about things like that. We were taught to be strong, to handle things ourselves. But…I’ve been thinking about it lately. Maybe I should have. It’s just…it’s always been something I’ve kept to myself. I’ve managed, until now. But these feelings…they’re overwhelming. I’m not sure how much longer I can manage on my own.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to share these things, and I appreciate you being so open with me. It’s perfectly okay to seek help, and it sounds like you might benefit from it. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I want to be thorough. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed as you see fit. I just want to find a way to manage this, so I can continue to help the families I assist.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 88, which is also slightly elevated. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No tenderness noted. Everything sounds and feels normal from a physical standpoint, which leads me to believe your symptoms are primarily related to anxiety. However, to be extra cautious, I would like to order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…very wise. I appreciate your thoroughness. A blood panel would certainly put my mind at ease. I’m happy to comply with whatever tests you deem necessary. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and find a way to manage the anxiety, so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. These tests will help rule out any physical causes for your symptoms, such as anemia, electrolyte imbalances, or thyroid issues. While we wait for the results, I think it would be beneficial to discuss some options for managing your anxiety. Have you ever considered talking to a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't. As I mentioned before, we didn't…do things like that. But…I'm willing to consider it. If you think it would help, I'm willing to try. I'm not sure where to even begin, to be honest. I've never spoken to anyone about this before, except for you. I’m a little apprehensive, but I’m willing to explore all options. What would that involve, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s very brave of you to be open to that, Rayshun. It’s understandable to feel apprehensive – it’s a big step! Therapy can be incredibly helpful for processing trauma and learning coping mechanisms for anxiety. There are different types of therapy, but given your history, I think trauma-focused therapy, such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing or Cognitive Processing Therapy , might be particularly beneficial. These therapies are specifically designed to help people process traumatic experiences in a safe and controlled environment. I can provide you with a list of qualified therapists in the area who specialize in trauma-focused therapy. They would be able to assess your specific needs and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. That would be…wonderful. A list of qualified therapists would be greatly appreciated. I’m not sure which type of therapy would be best, so I trust your judgment. EMDR or CPT…they sound…intimidating, but if you think they could help, I’m willing to try. Anything to get back to a sense of normalcy, and continue to assist the families I assist. Thank you, Doctor. You've already been a great help, just by listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshun. I’m glad I could help. Okay, here’s a list of three therapists who specialize in trauma-focused therapy. I've included their contact information and a brief description of their approach. I recommend reaching out to a few of them and scheduling a consultation to see if they’re a good fit for you. I also want to emphasize that it’s okay to “shop around” for a therapist. Finding the right person is crucial, and it’s important to find someone you feel comfortable with and trust. In the meantime, while you’re waiting for your blood test results and exploring therapy options, are there any immediate coping strategies you’ve found helpful in the past when feeling anxious?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to compile this. I will definitely reach out to a few of them. To be honest, I haven’t…really developed any coping strategies. I tend to withdraw, and try to avoid the things that trigger my anxiety. It's not very effective, but it's all I know. Sometimes, I'll listen to music, Lakota music, but it only provides temporary relief. I’ve also found that being outdoors, walking in nature, can be calming, but it's not always practical. It depends on the situation. I suppose those are the only things that have helped, to any extent. I am open to learning new strategies, however. Anything that can help me manage this anxiety, I am willing to try.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Withdrawing and listening to music are both common coping mechanisms, and it's positive that you've found some temporary relief with those. It sounds like you're already instinctively using some grounding techniques. There are a few other techniques we can explore. Deep breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing, can help calm your nervous system. Progressive muscle relaxation can also be helpful, as it involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups to reduce tension. Mindfulness meditation can help you focus on the present moment and reduce rumination. I can provide you with some resources on these techniques, if you're interested. There are also many apps and online programs that can guide you through these exercises. While we're waiting for your blood test results, and exploring therapy and coping strategies, if you experience a sudden increase in anxiety, or feel overwhelmed, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a crisis hotline or mental health professional. Your safety and well-being are my top priority. Would you like me to provide you with some contact information for crisis hotlines?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be very helpful. Contact information for crisis hotlines…that’s a good idea. I haven’t…needed them before, but it’s good to have, just in case. I will also look into those techniques you mentioned – deep breathing, muscle relaxation, mindfulness meditation. They sound…challenging, but I’m willing to try. It’s just…it’s all so new to me. I appreciate your patience and guidance, Doctor. You’ve already been a great help. I feel…a little more hopeful now, than when I first arrived. Thank you. I believe that is all for today, correct?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshun. I’m glad I could help, and I’m so glad to hear you’re feeling a little more hopeful. It is new, and it takes time and practice, so be kind to yourself. Yes, that’s all for today. We’ll follow up once your blood test results are back, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Rayshun. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor Kimm. Thank you again for your kindness and guidance. I appreciate everything you’ve done. I will be in touch once the blood test results are back. Take care as well, Doctor. And have a good day.
