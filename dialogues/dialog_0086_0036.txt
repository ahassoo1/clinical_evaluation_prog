DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban, so what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor, is correct. I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts. Medicare told me I need this, yes? To make sure everything is… okay. I do not have problems, I think. But they say it is needed.
DOCTOR: Right, a preventative check-up. Medicare is quite insistent on those, as they should be. Well, that’s sensible. So, you're not experiencing any specific complaints or symptoms at the moment?
PATIENT: No, no complaints. I work, I eat, I sleep. Everything is… normal. I lift heavy things at work, sometimes. Boxes, mostly. But my back is fine. I am strong. I do not get sick easily, either. I have always been healthy.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. And what kind of work do you do exactly, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: I work at the food place. The one that… prepares the meals. For the stores. I put things in boxes. And I lift the boxes onto the… the things that move them. Pallets, I think they are called. It is hard work, but… it is work. I need the money. It is not a job for thinking, if that is what you mean.
DOCTOR: Right, so a warehouse position, lifting and moving boxes. That explains things a bit. It's good you're employed, and it is physically demanding work. Have you had any injuries related to that work in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? No. Not serious. Maybe a little… ache in the shoulder, sometimes. But I rub it and it goes away. Old men get aches. I am not so old, but… it happens. I do not need a doctor for a little ache. I work with many men, and they have aches. It is normal. I take… a pain pill sometimes, but it is not every day. Maybe once a month.
DOCTOR: And what kind of pain pill are you taking, Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: Um… I do not know the name. The… the white one. Small. I buy it at the… the store. The one with everything. The pharmacy. It helps the pain. It is not strong, I do not think. Just a little. I do not want to become… dependent. Like some of the men at work. They take many pills. I do not want that. It is… bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to need you to be a little more specific. Do you remember anything about the packaging, or perhaps the first letter of the name?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I really do not remember. It is a small bottle. White. The pills are small, also. I ask the… the man at the counter. He gives it to me. I do not ask questions. I just pay the money and take it. It is for the pain. That is all I know. I am not a doctor, I do not need to know the name of every pill. It makes my shoulder feel better. Is that not enough?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand you don't want to make a fuss, but it’s very important for me to know exactly what medication you're taking. Even over-the-counter pain pills can interact with other things, and it’s crucial for your health. Do you have any of the pills with you, or the bottle they came in?
PATIENT: No. I took the last one yesterday. The bottle is… gone. I throw it away. I do not keep old bottles. It is… messy. I told you, Doctor. It is a small, white pill. I buy it at the store. That is all I know. Are you… not believing me? I am telling the truth. I just take a little pill for my shoulder sometimes. It is not a big deal. Why are you asking so many questions?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I am trying to help you, and it sounds like you're being a bit dismissive of potentially important information. Taking any medication, even something you buy over the counter, without knowing exactly what it is and how it might affect you is risky. We need to establish a complete list of your medications for your safety. Given your difficulty recalling the name of the pill, and the fact that you’ve been taking it without knowing exactly what it is, I'm going to recommend we start with some blood work. It will give me a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any potential interactions or concerns. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Blood work? For a little pill? Doctor, that seems… extreme. I am healthy. I told you. I do not need blood work. It will cost money, yes? And I need the money. This is for a small ache in my shoulder. I rub it, and it goes away. It is not worth the… the trouble. I do not understand why you are making this so complicated. I just came for the check-up. Before the insurance. Is this check-up going to cost a lot of money? Because if it is… I may need to leave.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, the blood work isn't just about the pill, it's part of a comprehensive assessment. We need a baseline to understand your overall health, especially as you're starting Medicare and have physical demands at work. I understand your concerns about cost, and we can certainly discuss that with the billing department. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure you receive appropriate care. Let's try this: Before we proceed with any tests, I want to ask about your family history. Sometimes, family history can shed light on potential health concerns. Have you or any of your close relatives had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Family history… My father, he was… sick. Old age, they said. He lived in Yemen, you see. Not good doctors there. He was weak, and he… stopped breathing. My mother, she had… problems with her stomach. Always complaining. She ate too much, I think. No good doctors for her, either. My brother, he is healthy. Works in the city. That is all. We do not talk about… sickness. It is bad luck. Is this… important? I do not understand how this helps with my shoulder.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Barban. While it may not directly relate to your shoulder pain, family history can give us clues about potential risks for other conditions. Knowing that your father had a sudden illness and your mother had stomach problems, even without a specific diagnosis, is helpful information. Now, regarding your shoulder pain – can you describe exactly where it hurts?
PATIENT: It hurts… here. Not all the time. When I lift heavy things. Or sometimes, when I sleep. It is… a dull ache. Not sharp. Like a… tiredness in the muscle. I rub it, and it gets better. I lift many boxes, you see. It is my job. Maybe it is just from the work. It is not… a big problem. I can still lift the boxes. I just… feel it sometimes. It does not stop me from working. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And how long have you been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Maybe… a year? Or more. I do not remember exactly. It comes and goes. Sometimes it is bad, sometimes it is not. Like I said, I rub it, and it gets better. It is not constant. It is… annoying, but I can live with it. I do not need to take time off work for it. I need the money, you see. This is what happens when you work hard. Your body gets… tired. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, it's good you're able to manage it for now, but chronic pain, even if it's manageable, shouldn't be ignored. It could indicate an underlying issue that needs attention. Just because you can "live with it" doesn't mean it's not worth investigating. I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your shoulder, just to assess the range of motion and identify any potential areas of tenderness. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Physical exam? You mean… touch my shoulder? I do not understand why you need to touch it. I told you it hurts when I lift heavy things. You can see I am strong. I lift many boxes. What will touching it do? It will not make the pain go away. It will just… hurt more. I do not like being touched. Especially by doctors. No offense, Doctor. But… I do not see the point. Is this necessary? For the check-up?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, a physical exam isn't about fixing the pain right away. It’s about gathering information. By gently moving your shoulder and feeling for areas of tenderness, I can get a better understanding of what’s causing the discomfort. It helps me rule out more serious issues and determine the best course of action. It’s a standard part of a medical evaluation. I understand your hesitation, and I will be as gentle as possible. If at any point it becomes too uncomfortable, please let me know, and we can stop. It’s a simple examination, and it’s important for your overall health. Would you allow me to proceed with just a basic assessment, and if it’s too uncomfortable, we can stop?
PATIENT: … Alright. But be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And if it hurts… I will tell you. I do not want you to… pull anything. It is my shoulder. I need it to lift the boxes. And… do not ask me to… move it too much. Just look, and… touch it softly. Is that okay? I do not like this, but… for the check-up, I will allow it. But very gently. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. Very gentle. That’s all I’ll do. We'll go at your pace. Alright, if you could just lift your arm up as high as you comfortably can… and then lower it slowly. Just to see the range of motion. Take your time.
PATIENT: Ow… there. That is as high as I can go. It feels… tight. Like something is… pulling. It is not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. See? It does not go very high. I told you it is tight. Is that what you wanted to see? It does not go very high.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does it hurt right here?
PATIENT: Aah! Yes. There. That spot. It is… sore. Not always. But when you touch it like that… yes. It is… tender. Like a bruise, but… inside. Be careful, Doctor. It is… sensitive there.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I understand. I’ll be very careful. And when you sleep, do you usually sleep on your right side?
PATIENT: Sometimes. When my back hurts, I sleep on my left side. But when my back is okay… I sleep on my right side. But I do not sleep very well. I toss and turn. And sometimes… I wake up with my shoulder… stiff. Like it is… stuck. It takes a while to… loosen it up. Is that… normal? Do other people wake up with stiff shoulders?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon to experience some stiffness in the morning, but waking up with a stiff shoulder frequently enough to mention it is worth noting. Alright, if you could just rotate your arm inwards… and then outwards. Very gently, just as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: Ow… there. That is as far as I can go. It feels… tight again. Like something is… blocking it. And… there. The same. It is not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a… pulling sensation. This is… not very pleasant, Doctor. Is this… necessary? For the check-up? I do not understand why you need to… twist my arm like this. It is just making it… sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll stop there. You're right, it doesn't sound like you're comfortable, and that's the most important thing. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some muscle tightness and limited range of motion in your right shoulder. It's likely related to the physical demands of your job. I would like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your shoulder – to rule out any underlying structural issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? You mean… like the ones at the airport? Is that… safe? I do not want too much radiation. And… how much will it cost? I do not have a lot of money, Doctor. Is it necessary? For the check-up? I just want to make sure everything is okay. I do not want to spend a lot of money on… pictures. Is there another way? Can you just… tell me if it is okay without the pictures? I trust your… judgment, but… the money. Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your concerns. An X-ray does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits of ruling out a potential problem outweigh the risks in this case. It's a standard diagnostic tool, and we take precautions to minimize exposure. The cost is around \$200, but it will be billed to Medicare, and you will only be responsible for your co-pay. I would like to proceed with the imaging because it's best to have a clear picture of what's happening in your shoulder to rule out any underlying structural damage. However, if you're truly concerned about the cost and would prefer to hold off on the imaging at this time, we can try a course of physical therapy and pain management. Would you prefer to start there?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… what is that? Does that cost money? And pain management… are you talking about… pills? I do not want too many pills, Doctor. I told you, I do not want to be dependent. I just want to make sure my shoulder is okay. I do not want to spend a lot of money on… therapy. And I do not want too many pills. Can you just… tell me if it is okay without the pictures and without the therapy and without the pills? I just need to lift the boxes. That is all. Is my shoulder strong enough to lift the boxes? Can you just… tell me that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your concerns and your hesitation. However, as a physician, I cannot definitively tell you if your shoulder is "okay" without proper investigation. It's irresponsible to provide a diagnosis without adequate information. Physical therapy involves exercises to strengthen and improve the range of motion in your shoulder. The cost would be around \$80 per session, and you would likely need several sessions. Pain management could involve over-the-counter medication or, if needed, a prescription for a stronger pain reliever, but that would be a last resort. Given your concerns about cost and medication, we can proceed with a conservative approach: I can recommend some simple stretches and exercises you can do at home, and we can reassess in a month. However, if your pain worsens or doesn’t improve, you will need to consider further investigation. Are you comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: … Yes. The stretches and exercises… at home. That is… okay. No pictures, no pills, no… therapy. Just the stretches. That I can do. Can you write them down for me? So I do not forget. And… how often should I do them? And… if my shoulder gets worse… what do I do then? I do not want to waste money on… pictures. But I do not want my shoulder to… break. Just write down the stretches, please. And tell me when to come back. If it gets worse. But I hope it does not get worse.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are some gentle stretches and exercises you can do at home. They're designed to improve your range of motion and strengthen the muscles around your shoulder. I've included instructions on how often to do them and proper form. I recommend doing these twice a day, and stopping if you feel any sharp pain. If your pain worsens or doesn’t improve after a month, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss further investigation. We can also consider a referral to a physical therapist if you'd like. Do you have any questions about the exercises?
PATIENT: Hmm… these look… complicated. What does this one mean? And… how long should I hold it for? And… is it okay if I do them while watching television? I like to watch television. And… if I forget to do them one day, is that bad? I get busy sometimes. And… if my shoulder gets really bad, can I just come here and see you? Without an appointment? Is that okay? I just want to be sure. And… thank you, Doctor. For not giving me too many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's go through these exercises step-by-step. This one… … involves gently reaching across your body, holding it for 15-20 seconds. It's important to keep your shoulder relaxed and avoid any sharp pain. It’s perfectly fine to do the exercises while watching television, as long as you maintain proper form. And if you forget to do them one day, don’t worry about it – just try to resume them the next day. As for seeing me without an appointment, it's best to schedule one in advance to ensure I have enough time to assess your condition properly. However, if you experience a sudden, severe pain, please go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explained it very well, Doctor. And… thank you again for not giving me too many pills. I really do not want to be dependent. I just want to lift the boxes. And… I will try to do the stretches. And I will try to remember to come back in a month. If my shoulder gets worse. But I hope it does not. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… helpful. I think that is everything. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Barban. Remember to listen to your body, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care of yourself, and I hope the stretches help. Goodbye, Mr. Barban.
PATIENT:
