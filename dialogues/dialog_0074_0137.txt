DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My husband… he think I need… how you say… okay for the old people place? The senior… living? He say I need check-up first.
DOCTOR: I see. Your husband is suggesting a check-up before considering a senior living facility, which is very thoughtful of both of you. That's an excellent idea. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on that led to this conversation?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… I forget things sometimes. Not big things, you know? Like… where I put my glasses. Or… the name of that actor… the one in all the movies. My son, he say I repeat myself too. And… I feel tired. Very tired. But I sleep okay, I think. It just… hard to do things. Like cooking. Or cleaning. My husband, he help a lot now. He very good husband.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like you’ve noticed some changes in your memory and energy levels, and that’s understandably concerning. It’s good that your husband and son are observant and supportive. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s been happening. When did you first start noticing these changes – the forgetfulness and the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Maybe… six months ago? It start slow. I think… I forget more and more little things. And the tired… maybe a little longer. Maybe eight months? It is hard to say. Things just… get mixed up in my head now. Not all the time, but… often enough to worry my son. He worry too much, maybe. But he love me.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that your son is concerned, and it’s good you have such a caring family. Six to eight months is helpful to know. Has anything specific happened recently that you feel has made these symptoms worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Not really… nothing big. The heat, maybe? It is very hot this summer. Makes me feel more tired, I think. And… my friend, Elena, she get sick. Very sick. I visit her in the hospital, but… it make me sad. Maybe sad make me more tired too? I don’t know. Everything feel… heavy lately.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Ms. Abdollahi. Significant life events, like a friend’s illness, and even things like the heat, can definitely contribute to fatigue and feelings of being overwhelmed. It’s important to consider all of these factors. Now, let’s talk a little bit more about the memory issues. You mentioned forgetting where you put things and repeating yourself. Can you give me an example of a time you repeated yourself recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yesterday, I ask my husband… three times… if he take out the trash. He just took it out! He show me, the trash can was empty. He no get mad, he just smile. But I felt silly. And… the day before, I ask him what we have for dinner… right after he tell me. I just… forget! He say it is okay, but I worry. I used to have good memory.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to worry when you notice changes like that, especially when you’ve always had a good memory. It sounds like these instances are relatively new and a bit frustrating for you both. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any difficulty with things like finding the right words when you’re speaking, or following conversations?
PATIENT: Sometimes… yes. The words… they hide. I know what I want to say, but… it take longer to come out. My husband, he patient. He wait for me. But sometimes… I just say something different than what I mean. And… when people talk fast… I get lost. I have to ask them to slow down. It make me feel… old.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you feel that way, Ms. Abdollahi, but feeling “old” doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. These things can happen for a variety of reasons, and we’ll work together to figure out what’s going on. Now, let’s move on to other areas of your health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have… the pressure. The high pressure, the doctor say. I take a little white pill every day. And… my knees. They hurt a lot. Especially when it is cold. I have the arthritis, I think. But that is all. I think. My husband take me to the doctor for check-ups, but I forget what they say sometimes. He know more than me.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So you’re being treated for high blood pressure and have arthritis in your knees. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned your husband often helps you remember details about your health – that’s wonderful that you have such a supportive partner. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. I eat everything. I like to cook, you know? I make my husband happy with my cooking. He likes the rice and beans. And… the plantains. No allergies. I eat everything. But I try to not eat too much sugar. The doctor say.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And it's wonderful that you enjoy cooking and take care of your husband. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I take a little pill for my knees when they hurt really bad. The ibuprofen, I think? It is red and white. And… sometimes I take something for my headache. But not often. The headaches are not so bad now. Mostly, just the white pill and the red and white pill when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for high blood pressure regularly, and ibuprofen and something for headaches as needed. That’s helpful. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine care?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Long time ago… when I was young… I have the baby. Two babies! That was a surgery. And… one time, I fall and break my arm. They fix it. But that was a long time ago. Everything is okay now. No other surgeries.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So you had surgeries for the birth of your children and to repair a broken arm. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My mother… she get sick when she get old. Very sick. I think… something with her head. Like… forgetful. But I don’t know what it was. She in Honduras, now. My father… he was strong. He live long time. No problems. My brothers and sisters… they okay. Mostly okay. One sister have the pressure, like me. But that is all I remember.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. So your mother experienced some memory issues later in life, and your sister has high blood pressure. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm… I stay home mostly. I cook, I clean, I watch the television. My husband, he go to work. Sometimes, my son and his family come visit. I like that. I used to go dancing… when I was younger. But now… I am too tired. And my knees hurt. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe one glass of wine sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So you’re mostly retired, enjoying time at home with your husband and family. You don’t smoke, and you have a very occasional glass of wine. That’s good to know. Now, just to be thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. I appreciate your trust. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/92, which is not unexpected given your history. Your pulse is 78, which is normal. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your strength is good, although a little weaker in your legs, likely from less activity. Finally, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Ask me anything, Doctor. I will try my best. But… sometimes I forget things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take our time. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… today… Let me see… Is it… August? Yes, I think it is August. The second of August. 2025, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. Very good. Now, can you tell me where we are today?
PATIENT: Hmm… This is the… the doctor’s office. Dr. Reisig’s office. I think it is on… Main Street? I not sure. It is in the city.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. You are doing very well. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. I think I remember. Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple math questions. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That is… hard. Let me see… 100… 93? No… I am sorry. I can’t do that. It is too hard. My brain… it does not work so good with numbers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Don’t worry about it at all. Many people find that challenging. It’s not a test of intelligence, it’s just a way to assess certain brain functions. Now, let’s move on to something else. Can you tell me the names of at least three things we’ve talked about today?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… We talked about… my husband. And… my pressure. The high blood pressure. And… the pills I take. And… the headache. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. You remembered several things very well. Thank you. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, that was a helpful brief assessment. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam and cognitive assessment, it sounds like you’re experiencing some cognitive changes that warrant further investigation. Specifically, the difficulty with counting backwards and recalling the three words is concerning.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Concerning? What does that mean, Doctor? Am I… sick? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean you’re “sick,” Ms. Abdollahi. It simply means we need to figure out why you're having these difficulties. There are many possible causes, and we need to rule them out. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, medication side effects, or the early stages of cognitive impairment, like mild cognitive impairment or dementia. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other important markers. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural problems. And, I think it would be helpful to have you meet with a neurologist, a specialist in brain health, for a more comprehensive evaluation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Hmm… blood work is okay. I don’t like needles, but… if you think it is important. And a brain scan? Is that… scary? Will it hurt? I don’t want anything scary. The neurologist… I don’t know. I just want to be okay. I want to remember my family.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. The blood work is a simple procedure, and we’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. The brain scan, an MRI, is a painless procedure. You’ll lie very still on a table while the machine takes pictures of your brain. It’s like a very powerful magnet, so we’ll need to make sure you don’t have any metal in your body, but it doesn't involve any radiation or discomfort. And meeting with a neurologist doesn’t mean anything is definitely wrong. They’re simply experts who can help us understand what’s going on and develop a plan to help you stay as healthy and independent as possible. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about any of these tests or the referral to the neurologist?
PATIENT: Hmm… will the tests take long? I don’t want to be away from my husband too long. And… if it is bad… what can we do? Can they fix it?
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Ms. Abdollahi. The blood work shouldn't take more than an hour or so, and we can schedule the brain scan at your convenience. As for what we can do if something is found… it depends on the cause. Sometimes, cognitive changes are caused by treatable conditions, like vitamin deficiencies or medication side effects, and we can fix them. Other times, it might be something more progressive, like mild cognitive impairment or dementia. In those cases, we focus on managing the symptoms, slowing down the progression, and helping you maintain your quality of life. There are medications that can help, therapies that can improve your memory and thinking skills, and support groups that can provide emotional support. We won’t know what’s going on until we get the results of the tests, but I want to assure you that we’ll explore all options and work together to create a plan that’s right for you. I’m going to write an order for the blood work and a referral to a neurologist named Dr. Ramirez. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also give you some information about resources for people with cognitive changes and their families. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I just… I want to remember my family.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. That's a wonderful thing to want, and we'll do everything we can to help you. I want to reassure you that we'll be here to support you every step of the way. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time.
