DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kinjerski. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor TodoroVICH. It’s my leg, actually. It’s been… well, numb, for a bit now. Not constantly, but often enough that it’s become concerning.
DOCTOR: Numbness, okay. And how long exactly is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe three weeks ago? Perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t immediate, you see. It began as a sort of tingling, and slowly progressed to feeling… absent, almost. It's primarily in my left leg, from the thigh down to the foot. I can still feel if someone touches me, but it’s… muted.
DOCTOR: Right. Tingling progressing to muted sensation. And is this constant, intermittent, does anything specific trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: It’s definitely intermittent. It’s not there all the time, thankfully. I haven’t noticed anything specific that triggers it, no. I’ve been doing a lot of work at my desk lately – animating, mostly – so I initially thought it might be from sitting for too long, but it happens even when I’ve been walking around. And it doesn’t feel worse with any particular activity, just… present, or not. It’s rather perplexing.
DOCTOR: Animating… so a lot of static positioning, even if you are walking around periodically. Okay. And have you noticed any weakness in that leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s a good question. I haven't been consciously aware of any, no. I lift things, walk around – I haven’t dropped anything or stumbled, and my usual tasks haven’t felt any more difficult. It’s hard to say if there's a subtle difference I haven't noticed, but nothing obvious, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, “nothing obvious.” Let’s move on. Any pain associated with the numbness?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s so odd about it. No tingling before pain, no aching, no sharp stabs… just the absence of sensation. It feels… strange. Like my leg is wearing a thick glove, almost. It’s not unpleasant, just disconcerting. It’s why I decided to come in; it doesn't hurt, but it’s not right.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no weakness, no pain, just… altered sensation. Have you had any recent injuries to that leg?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. I haven’t fallen or bumped it particularly hard, no. I do spend a fair bit of time outdoors, hiking and such, but nothing out of the ordinary – no twisting an ankle or anything like that. I’m fairly careful, you see. I haven’t been sick recently either, no fever or anything of that nature.
DOCTOR: Hiking, animating… So, relatively active, but potentially prolonged static positions. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is this alright? I apologize for my height, it sometimes makes things… awkward.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… present, 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in both legs, though I suspect you build up a fair amount of muscle from your activities. Now, can you walk on your toes and heels for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that alright? I’m trying to be as precise as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that’s enough. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Although, as we discussed, the sensation is… muted, not as sharp as it usually is. It feels… present, but dampened. Is there something specific you are testing for?
DOCTOR: Okay. Fine. So, normal reflexes, normal strength, muted sensation. It could be nerve compression, though honestly, I don’t see a clear cause given your activity level. We’ll need to rule out other things. I’m going to order some bloodwork, just to be safe. And an MRI of your lower back.
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… rather involved. Is that truly necessary? And what sort of things are we ruling out? I understand you're the medical professional, of course, but I appreciate understanding the reasoning behind these steps. And what sort of bloodwork? I have insurance, but… costs can add up, you see.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Kinjerski, I’m not ordering tests just for fun. Numbness can be a symptom of many things, some quite serious. Bloodwork will rule out things like vitamin deficiencies, diabetes. The MRI is to check for any pressure on your spinal nerves. Yes, it’s expensive, but it's necessary to get a proper diagnosis. I wouldn't order it if I didn’t think it was warranted. Frankly, your age and height make certain possibilities more concerning. I need to be thorough.
PATIENT: I understand. You’re right, of course, I apologize for questioning your judgment. It’s just… it’s a bit disconcerting to think of serious possibilities. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I trust your expertise. What sort of preparation is required for the MRI? And regarding the bloodwork, will I need to fast beforehand? I want to be as prepared as possible. Could you perhaps give me a list of the tests being ordered, for my own records?
DOCTOR: Alright. No fasting for the bloodwork, but drink plenty of water. For the MRI, you'll need to remove any metal objects, and they’ll give you specific instructions when you schedule the appointment. This list has everything. Look, I'm ordering a standard panel, plus vitamin B12. The MRI center will handle the rest. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and imaging center now. Come back in two weeks with the results, and we’ll discuss them. Any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That clarifies everything. Thank you for your time and expertise. I'll schedule the appointments as soon as possible. I appreciate your patience.
