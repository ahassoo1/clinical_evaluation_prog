DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's this… shaking. Been happening for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. Feels like my hand… just trembles sometimes. It’s a nuisance, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tremor, you said. And it's mostly in your hand?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly the hand. Right hand, I think… or maybe it’s both? Honestly, it comes and goes, and I don’t pay it much mind usually. It's just… it’s getting a little harder to do things, like hold a cup steady. That's when I figured I should probably get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to have it looked at. It’s always best to get these things checked. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When it happens… hmm. That’s a tricky one. Seems like when I'm… resting, maybe? Not when I'm doing something, usually. But sometimes when I try to do something precise… like buttoning my shirt… it's worse. Or… holding a spoon, like I said. It's all a bit muddled, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, we can take our time. So, it sounds like it’s most noticeable at rest, but also worsens with activities requiring precision. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse besides precise movements?
PATIENT: Trigger it… Now you’re asking something. Let me think… No, not that I’ve noticed. Coffee maybe? I drink a bit of coffee in the mornings. But I've been drinking coffee for, well, a lifetime. Doesn’t seem to be a recent thing. Oh… and stress, perhaps? Though what doesn't get worse with stress, eh? I try not to get too worked up. But it’s hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee and stress are possibilities. We’ll keep those in mind. Do you have any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been feeling a little… tired lately, but who doesn’t? And my… muscles feel a bit stiff sometimes. But again, I'm an old man. Things are bound to ache. I don't know if that's related, though. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if this shaking is anything serious. It's just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It’s good you're coming in to get this checked out. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. We’ll also take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just as a standard part of the exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Get it over with, eh? The sooner I know, the better. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Arms extended… palms up. Go ahead. Just… be quick about it, if you wouldn’t mind. It feels strange, having someone poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a few simple movements. Could you please touch your finger to your nose, then touch my finger, then repeat?
PATIENT: There… almost. It’s harder than it looks, you know. This darn shaking… Not my finest moment, I’ll tell you that.
DOCTOR: I see. It does seem to be impacting your coordination. Now, let’s look at your hands. Can you hold this paper like this?
PATIENT: Here. It’s… difficult to hold steady. What now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Now, could you please try tapping your thumb to each of your fingers, one at a time, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: One… two… three… It's… not very smooth, is it? This is ridiculous. I used to be able to do this without even thinking about it. Now look at me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik. It's clear there's a tremor present, and it's impacting your coordination. Based on what I’m seeing – the resting tremor, the diminished reflexes, the difficulty with coordination – it’s suggestive of Essential Tremor. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and also do a basic metabolic panel. And just to be thorough, and since this has been ongoing for some time, I would recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. They can perform further testing and provide a definitive diagnosis and long-term management plan. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist, huh? More doctors… More tests… Look, Doctor, is this something serious? Is this… Parkinson's or something? That’s what my wife used to have. I don't want… I don’t want that. If it’s not dangerous, I don’t see the point in all this fuss. Just tell me if I need to worry, and I'll be on my way. I'm an old man, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It's completely natural to be worried, especially given your wife’s experience. While I can't give you a definitive diagnosis without further testing, based on my examination, it doesn't appear to be Parkinson’s disease. Essential Tremor is a common condition, and while it can be bothersome, it's generally not life-threatening. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities, which is why I'm recommending the blood tests and referral to a neurologist. The neurologist can perform a more detailed neurological exam and potentially order additional tests like a DaTscan, which can help differentiate between Essential Tremor and Parkinson’s disease. They can then provide you with a clear diagnosis and discuss management options, which may include medication, lifestyle modifications, or deep brain stimulation in certain cases. We want to make sure we get this properly diagnosed and have a plan in place, so you can manage this and continue to live your life comfortably. Would you like me to explain the blood tests and the referral process in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Fine. Blood tests, neurologist… whatever you think is best. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long for the results, eh? I haven’t got all the time in the world. And no complicated jargon, please. Just tell me what it is, in plain English. And… thank you, Doctor. For not saying it’s Parkinson’s. That’s… a relief. Just get it over with. Let's get the blood tests done, and then I’ll see about this neurologist. .
