DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MayHugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… nice to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit hard to explain. Things have been… off. My hearing keeps going, then coming back, and I get really dizzy with it. It’s been happening on and off, and my daughter, bless her, she thought I really should come see someone. She mentioned something about… family history too? I can’t quite recall everything. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. MayHugh. It sounds quite unsettling to have your hearing fluctuating and experiencing dizziness. It's good of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. And don't worry about being fuzzy; we'll take our time and get to the bottom of this. Let's start with the hearing and dizziness. When did you first notice these episodes starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… when did it start? That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a few months ago, maybe? Around springtime, I think? It wasn't constant at first, just little things. Like, I’d have trouble hearing the television, or feel a bit unsteady when I stood up. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s… gotten worse. It's hard to say exactly when, though. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. “A few months ago, around springtime” is a good starting point. And it’s very common for these things to start gradually, so don’t feel bad about not having a precise date. Now, when you say “worse”, could you describe how it’s worse?
PATIENT: Well, now the dizziness… it really spins sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully. But when it happens, everything goes round and round, and I have to sit down. And my hearing… it doesn’t always come back right away now. It’s like… muffled, for a while. A couple of times it felt like my ear was full of water, even though it wasn't. And it's… unsettling, feeling like you can’t hear properly. Makes you anxious, if you know what I mean. It’s not just a little quiet, it’s… different.
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand. That sounds quite distressing, Ms. MayHugh – the spinning sensation, the muffled hearing, and the feeling of fullness in your ear. It's understandable that it would make you anxious. Let's talk about those episodes. How long do they typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… how long? That varies, you see. Some of them… just a few minutes, maybe. I’d feel a bit wobbly and a bit quiet, then it’d pass. But others… they’ve lasted for hours. I remember one time, I couldn't get out of bed all day. Everything was spinning, and I couldn’t hear a thing properly. My daughter had to bring me soup and everything. It’s hard to tell, really, because sometimes I drift off to sleep when I’m feeling bad, and I wake up and it’s… better, but I don’t know how long it’s been. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So, episodes ranging from minutes to hours, and sometimes you’re sleeping through parts of it, making it difficult to know the exact duration. That’s helpful to know. Now, do these episodes happen with any particular movements?
PATIENT: Movements? Hmmm… Now that you mention it… I think sometimes it happens when I turn my head quickly. Or when I lie down. But not always! It seems random, really. Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting still. Other times… well, I was gardening last week, bending over to pull weeds, and it came on then. So I’m not sure if there’s a pattern. It’s a bit… unpredictable, if you understand. My daughter keeps asking me if I'm dizzy when I stand up, but it's not always that. Sometimes it just… happens.
DOCTOR: Yes, “unpredictable” is a good way to describe it. It sounds like it can be triggered by head movements, but also occurs spontaneously. Now, Ms. MayHugh, I’d like to ask about any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or any problems with your balance, besides the dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Nausea… yes, sometimes, when the dizziness is really bad, I feel a bit sick to my stomach. Not enough to throw up, thankfully. Just… queasy. And my balance… Well, it's not good even when I'm not dizzy. I've always been a bit clumsy, if I'm honest. But when I am dizzy, it's even worse, of course. I have to hold onto things, you know? Furniture, walls… my daughter worries about me falling. I haven’t actually fallen yet, thank goodness, but I'm careful. I don't think I’ve been sick, as in vomiting, with it though. Not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea with the dizziness, and a general sense of unsteadiness, even when not actively experiencing an episode, with a worsening when the dizziness occurs. That's good information. Now, let’s go through some other things. Have you had any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Hmmm… You know, now that you mention it, yes. Sometimes. It's not constant, not a loud ring. It’s more like… a high-pitched whine. Very faint. I thought it was just the silence, you know? Living out here in the country, it gets very quiet. But yes, I suppose there is a ringing. It comes and goes. Not very often, though. It's not bothersome, really. Just… there, sometimes. It's hard to explain. It's a quiet sort of ringing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet, intermittent high-pitched ringing in your ears. That’s good to know. Now, Ms. MayHugh, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… medical history. Let me see. I had… a touch of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. And I used to get migraines when I was younger, but they haven’t bothered me for years. My doctor, Dr. Sharma, he checked my blood pressure a while back and said it was a little high, but he didn't prescribe anything for it. He said to watch my diet. And… I had my gallbladder removed years ago. That was… a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t really know. I try not to worry about things, you see. I’m not good with remembering medical details. My daughter probably knows more than I do. I take a bit of paracetamol every now and then for aches and pains, that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of migraines in the past, previous gallbladder removal, and slightly elevated blood pressure that's being managed with diet. You take paracetamol occasionally for aches and pains. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I've never really had a reaction to anything. I've taken all sorts of things over the years, for colds and headaches, and never had a problem. My daughter always asks me if I'm allergic to penicillin, but I've never been told I am. I eat all sorts of foods, too. Shellfish, nuts… everything. I'm not a fussy eater, you see. No, no allergies. That I know of, anyway. It’s probably best to check with my daughter, though. She keeps a record of things like that. I just… don’t pay much attention to details.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like hearing loss, dizziness, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That's another tricky one. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older. And my brother… he had some problems with his balance when he was a young man. The doctor said it was something to do with his inner ear, but I can't remember the details. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, she went deaf when she got very old. But that was very old. Other than that… I don't really know. My family wasn't one for talking about medical things. We just… got on with it. It's all a bit hazy, to be honest. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. My daughter would probably know more. She's very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your mother, balance issues in your brother possibly related to the inner ear, and hearing loss in an aunt when she was very old. Now, Ms. MayHugh, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Oh dear. Well, I live alone since my husband passed. I keep myself busy. I like gardening, mostly. And I do a bit of reading. I try to stay active, you know? I walk to the shops when the weather is nice. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of wine with my dinner sometimes. I don’t go out much these days. Mostly just visit my daughter and grandchildren. It's a quiet life, you see. Very peaceful. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a bit of cake now and then. I don't really do much strenuous exercise. Just… gentle things, you know? Nothing too taxing. I try to keep a routine, it helps. It’s a simple life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. MayHugh. That gives me a very good understanding of your background and your current situation. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your ears, your blood pressure, and do a few tests to assess your balance and coordination. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, alright? My balance isn't very good as it is. And if I get dizzy, please let me know you're there to catch me. I don't want to fall. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. MayHugh. I will be very careful. Okay, let’s start with your ears. I’m just looking to see if there’s any wax buildup or signs of infection. I see a little bit of wax in both ears, but nothing significant. Your ear drums look normal. No signs of infection. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. As you mentioned, Dr. Sharma had noted this previously. Now, I’d like to check your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I don’t feel very steady, Doctor. It's hard to balance with my eyes closed, you see. I'm afraid I might fall. Perhaps… perhaps we should skip that part?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MayHugh. Your safety is my priority. We’ll skip the balance test for now. I’m also going to perform a quick Dix-Hallpike maneuver to assess for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV. This involves quickly moving your head to different positions while lying down. It can sometimes trigger your dizziness, but it’s a safe test. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Dix-Hallpike… maneuver? Trigger my dizziness…? Oh dear. That doesn't sound very pleasant, Doctor. I already feel a bit unsteady. I’m not sure I want to deliberately make myself more dizzy. Perhaps… perhaps we could just skip that test as well? I don't think I'm up to it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. MayHugh. Absolutely. We won’t perform any tests you’re not comfortable with. Your well-being is the most important thing. Based on your symptoms – the fluctuating hearing, dizziness with spinning sensation, the ringing in your ears, and the lack of significant findings on the ear exam – and taking into account your history of slightly elevated blood pressure, I suspect you may be experiencing a combination of issues. It’s possible you have some degree of Meniere’s disease, which affects the inner ear, and possibly some positional vertigo contributing to the dizziness. However, we need further testing to confirm this. I’d like to order an audiogram to assess your hearing and a Vestibular Function Test to evaluate your inner ear balance. Would you be able to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Audiogram… Vestibular Function Test… Oh dear. More tests… I suppose so. As long as they don’t involve deliberately making me dizzy. I can schedule them, yes. My daughter usually helps me with these things. She’s very organized. Can you give me the details, so I can pass them on to her? I'm not very good at remembering these things, you see. And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. It's unsettling feeling like I might fall over at any moment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. MayHugh. I'll write down the details for the audiogram and Vestibular Function Test. The audiogram can be done at the clinic next door, and the Vestibular Function Test will need to be scheduled at the specialist center in the city. It usually takes about a week to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a low-sodium diet, as excess salt can sometimes exacerbate the symptoms of inner ear disorders. I'll also prescribe a medication called meclizine, which can help with the dizziness. It's a mild antihistamine, and it can sometimes cause drowsiness, so please be careful when driving or operating machinery. I'll also suggest avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as these can also trigger dizziness. Do you have any questions about the medication or the dietary recommendations?
PATIENT: Low-sodium diet… meclizine… No caffeine, no alcohol… Alright. It sounds like a lot to remember. Caffeine and alcohol I can manage easily enough. But low-sodium… that might be tricky. I do enjoy a bit of salt with my food. And meclizine… does it have any side effects? I don’t want to be too drowsy. I still want to be able to enjoy my gardening. And… how long should I take the medication for? Is it a long-term thing? It’s just… I don't want to be relying on medication for the rest of my life, if possible. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. MayHugh. It's completely reasonable to be hesitant about taking medication long-term. Meclizine can cause drowsiness in some people, but it's usually mild. If you experience significant drowsiness, you can reduce the dose or stop taking the medication altogether. It's also important to avoid driving or operating machinery if you're feeling drowsy. As for the low-sodium diet, it's not necessarily a lifelong commitment. We're recommending it initially to see if it helps reduce your symptoms. You can gradually reintroduce salt into your diet if your symptoms improve. We’ll start with a one-month trial of the medication and the dietary changes. After that, we'll reassess your symptoms and decide on the best course of action. The goal is to find a solution that allows you to feel normal again without relying on medication unnecessarily. Do you have any questions about the potential side effects of the medication, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s alright. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… the dizziness, that’s what worries me the most. Falling over… I’m afraid of falling and breaking something. But… I suppose it’s good to have a plan. And… I trust your judgement. I’ll pass the details on to my daughter, and she’ll schedule the tests. And I’ll try my best with the low-sodium diet. It’s just… I love my food, you see. I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your help. It’s a relief to finally have a plan, even if it involves a few tests and a few restrictions. I appreciate your patience and your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. I understand your concerns, and I’m here to help every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And remember, safety first. If you experience any sudden or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room. I’m glad we were able to come up with a plan. Have a good day, Ms. MayHugh, and please take care.
