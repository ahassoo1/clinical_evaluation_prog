DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Fabing. Thirty-five years old. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Osga. It’s just… paperwork, really. I got a notice about needing to fill some things out for Medicare, and I figured it’d be easier to do it here with someone to help if I get confused.
DOCTOR: Paperwork. Always paperwork. Honestly, people come in for the silliest things. Alright, let's get this over with then. Do you have the forms with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here they are. I tried to start some of them, but… well, some of the questions were a bit unclear. I didn’t want to guess and mess things up.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let me see what the fuss is about. Honestly, it’s all pretty straightforward. Have you been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mean, nothing major. I had really bad asthma as a kid, but I grew out of most of it. Sometimes it flares up with the smoke from wildfires, but that’s about it. Does that count? I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, just for check-ups.
DOCTOR: Asthma. Right. And you're… Blackfeet, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. From the reservation here in Montana. My family’s been there for generations. Is that important for the forms?
DOCTOR: Everything is important, Ms. Fabing. It’s called a comprehensive history. Do any other illnesses run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. My grandma on my mother’s side had… diabetes, I think? And my uncle, her son, he had heart trouble. I think that’s about it. My mother always said our family was pretty healthy, all things considered. But I don’t really know a lot of the details.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And you said you haven’t been to a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. I work a lot, you know? Control and valve stuff… it keeps me pretty busy. And it’s… well, it’s not easy getting time off. Plus, I just haven’t really needed to go. Until this paperwork thing, of course. I always figured if something was really wrong, I’d go, but… preventative stuff just never felt urgent.
DOCTOR: Fine. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. No reactions to bee stings or anything like that, either. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: And medications?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. And sometimes a little allergy medicine during ragweed season. Nothing regular, though. Oh! And I use a rescue inhaler sometimes when the smoke gets really bad, like during wildfire season. But that’s it. Does that count as a medication? It's not… prescribed, exactly. I just keep one on hand.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Let's just say ibuprofen and the inhaler. Right. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My grandpa smoked, and it wasn’t pretty. I’ve always stayed away from it. And I don’t drink much either, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not even that lately, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you’re relatively healthy, which is… good. Let’s finish this paperwork then. Just fill in your Medicare information and sign at the bottom. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay. Medicare number… hmm… alright, here we go. Is there a box for emergency contact? I didn’t see one.
DOCTOR: It’s on the second page, Ms. Fabing. Look carefully. Honestly, people… Just hurry up.
PATIENT: Oh! There it is. Sorry. I’m just trying to be thorough. My husband, Dale. He's right here in town. Is that everything? I don't want to leave anything out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s enough. I’ll submit this. Don't bother me unless something serious comes up. Next!
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Osga. I appreciate you helping me with the paperwork. Have a good day.
