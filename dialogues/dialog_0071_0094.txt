DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… hello. My husband… he make appointment for me. Something about… learning? I forget. I work with metal, very busy job. Not much time for… this.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. That’s perfectly alright. Sometimes appointments feel like… another thing on the list. Your husband mentioned learning, so perhaps he was concerned about memory?
PATIENT: Memory? I… I don’t know. Things… happen. I forget where I put my tools sometimes. Or what I eat for lunch. Is that… bad? I don’t feel sick. Just… old, maybe? It’s a hard job.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to recognize these things are… different than usual. Forgetting things occasionally is normal, especially with a demanding job like yours. But let’s try to get a clearer picture. When did you start noticing these memory slips?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Maybe… last year? Or was it the year before? Everything is so… fast. Work, home, work… I don't really think about when I forget. I just… do the next thing. Is this going to take long? I have a big order to finish.
DOCTOR: We'll try to be as efficient as possible, Airam. A few more questions, and then we can do a quick check-up, just to rule things out. Last year… so roughly a year ago, you started noticing increased forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe. It's… little things. Like names. Customers come, I meet them a lot, but sometimes… poof. Gone. And sometimes I go to the shop and I… forget what I need to buy. My husband gets mad. He says I’m not paying attention. Is this about my brain? Is something wrong with my brain?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Airam. We want to figure out what’s going on, and it could be a number of things. Let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No. I get tired. Very, very tired. But that’s the job. Metal is heavy. I eat… okay. I guess. My husband cooks. I mostly just drink tea. Lots of tea. And… I don't sleep well. I worry a lot. About work, about money… about forgetting things. Is that a symptom? Worrying?
DOCTOR: Yes, those can be symptoms, Airam. Fatigue, trouble sleeping, and anxiety. Okay. Let's take a quick look at your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No! No conditions. I’m strong. I work with metal! Never sick. Not really. Maybe a cold sometimes. But nothing… serious. My mother… she had problems with her stomach. But that’s… different. I don’t have stomach problems. What is this about, Doctor? Are you saying I’m… sick?
DOCTOR: No, Airam, I'm not saying you’re sick. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. And it's good to know about your mother's stomach problems – family history can be important. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm… I think… maybe when I was little? Something with my tonsils. But it was so long ago, I barely remember. My husband says I had stitches, but… I don't remember going to the hospital or anything. It was… a very long time ago. Does it matter? I feel fine, mostly. Just… forgetful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tonsillectomy a long time ago. That's good to know. And you said your husband gets concerned about your memory?
PATIENT: He worries about everything. About the money, about the work, about the house. Now about me forgetting things. He says I’m not organized. That I leave tools everywhere. He gets very… loud. He says I’m a mess. But I need my tools! How can I work if I can’t find my tools? It’s very frustrating. He doesn't understand.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress both at work and at home. And it's understandable why you'd be frustrated. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No! No pills. I don’t like pills. My husband… he takes some things for his blood pressure, but I don’t take anything. Tea is enough. And… sometimes a little bit of ginger when my stomach hurts. But that’s it. Just tea. I don’t trust those pills. They make you feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And you mostly drink tea, with a bit of ginger for your stomach sometimes. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I really need to get back to work. The order is very big. And my husband will be angry if I’m gone too long. What are you even looking for? Is this going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: We'll be as quick as possible, Airam. And we’ll talk about costs later. I just want to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam – that just means checking your reflexes and balance. It won't take long at all. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m warning you, my blood pressure is probably high. I worry a lot. And my husband… he makes me worry even more. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm… that's it. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Not drastically high, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Everything sounds clear, but a little fast. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: This is… silly. I can see. I’m not blind. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to go. And my husband… he’s going to be furious if I’m late. Is my blood pressure high because of him?
DOCTOR: It’s just part of the routine, Airam. It helps us get a complete picture. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just let your arms relax… good. And can you stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: I can stand. But I’m not very good at balance. Metal is heavy. It makes you… tired. And my husband always tells me to hurry. It makes me feel… rushed. Is this test about my rushing? Is he making me sick? This is ridiculous. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little unsteady. Nothing too concerning, but it's good we're checking. Now, can you walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe, like you’re walking on a tightrope?
PATIENT: Whoa! I told you! I'm terrible at balance. Metal… it hurts my feet. And my husband… he never helps me carry things. He says I'm weak. This is… humiliating. Can I sit down now? I feel dizzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Please sit down. Okay, Airam, that was helpful. Your balance is a little off, and you did mention some dizziness. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like a combination of things could be going on. The forgetfulness, fatigue, and anxiety could be related to stress, but the balance issues and dizziness warrant further investigation. I want to rule out some other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work, just to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function. And I think an MRI of your brain would be a good idea, just to make sure everything looks normal.
PATIENT: Blood work? An MRI? What does that even mean? That sounds… expensive. And scary. I don't like needles. And I don't like being stuck in machines. My husband is going to be furious if I spend more money on tests. And what if something is wrong? I don't want to know. I just want to go back to work and forget about all this. Can’t I just take some tea? And maybe a nap? This is too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Airam. It is a lot to take in. The blood work is a simple procedure – just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. And the MRI is painless – you’ll lie inside a scanner while it takes pictures of your brain. It's a safe procedure, and it will help us understand what's going on. We'll discuss the costs with you and see if there are options to make it more affordable. And it’s important to remember that finding out what's going on is the best way to address it. We’re not looking for anything specific right now; we're just being thorough. We'll take it one step at a time. How about this: I'll write you a referral for the blood work and the MRI. You don't have to schedule them right away. You can think about it, talk to your husband, and then decide what you’re comfortable with. In the meantime, let's talk about some stress management techniques. Are you familiar with any relaxation exercises, like deep breathing or meditation?
PATIENT: No! No relaxation exercises. I work with metal! I don’t have time for… that. And my husband… he just tells me to work harder. He doesn’t understand. This is too much. I just want to go home. And forget about all this. Can I at least get a note for work? To explain why I was gone so long? He's going to be furious.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I can write you a note for work explaining your appointment. I’ll include that you were undergoing some medical evaluation. And I understand you're feeling overwhelmed right now, Airam. It’s okay to take things one step at a time. Here you go. This note explains that you were seen for medical evaluation and may require further testing. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and the MRI, if you decide to proceed with those. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe headaches, dizziness, or difficulty walking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I just want to go home. And forget about all this. Tell my husband… I'm sorry. .
