DOCTOR: Alright, Janie Licano, 52 years old. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Um… chronic… fatigue, I think the paper says? Honestly, it’s just… being tired. Really tired. It’s been going on… a while now. I don’t really keep track of dates so well these days. It just… is. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: “Chronic fatigue…” Yes, well, it’s a start. “Just being tired” can mean a lot of things, unfortunately. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “A while now” is… not terribly specific, but we'll get there. Let's try to narrow it down a little. When you say tired, is it more of a physical exhaustion, like you’ve run a marathon, or more… mentally draining?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… both? Like, my body aches, you know? But also… I just can’t seem to… focus. Things slip my mind. I forget why I even walked into a room sometimes. It's frustrating. It's not like I'm getting less active, if that makes sense? I still… do things. It’s just… harder.
DOCTOR: Right. Aches and… mental fog. It’s common, honestly. A lot of people these days are running on empty. Still, we need to rule things out. Have you noticed if it's worse at a certain time of day?
PATIENT: Oh dear… time… That’s tricky. Maybe… afternoons? Yes, I think it gets worse in the afternoon. Everything just… feels heavier. And I nap more. I don’t mean to, but I just… collapse on the sofa sometimes. My husband… well, he used to say I was a sleepyhead. But he’s… gone now. So it doesn’t bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Afternoon fatigue, naps… It could be a number of things. Let’s go through some basics. Any changes in your appetite or weight lately?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat… enough, I think. I used to cook a lot more, but now it’s mostly just… simple things. Weight… I don’t know. I haven’t weighed myself in ages. I suppose I’ve lost a little, maybe? Everything feels… loose. But I’m tall, you know? 187… something centimeters. So maybe you wouldn’t notice. Is this taking long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a general idea, Janie. Weight loss can be significant. And height doesn’t negate that. We’re just trying to build a picture here. Now, let's talk about sleep. Aside from the naps, how are you sleeping at night?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep… it comes and goes. I wake up a lot. Sometimes I’m hot, sometimes I just… can't get comfortable. My legs… they ache, you know? And then I’m thinking about things. Old things. Things that… don’t matter anymore. So I just… lie there. I don’t really… dream much. Or if I do, I don't remember them. It's just… quiet. Mostly. Can we… get this over with soon?
DOCTOR: Right. Interrupted sleep, leg aches… Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Well, I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible, but… persistent. And my hands… they’re always cold. Even in the summer. And… oh! I’ve been feeling a bit dizzy lately. Especially when I stand up quickly. But I just thought it was… old age. It's probably nothing. Honestly, I don't want to bother you with all this.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” can still be something. Alright. Headaches, cold hands, dizziness… We should check your blood pressure and do a quick physical exam. Just to rule things out. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh… careful now… Yes, alright. I feel a bit… wobbly, to be honest. Everything seems to… swim a little. Is this going to take much longer? I really have to… get going.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little low, and your pulse is somewhat irregular. Okay, let’s just listen to your lungs again… Do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. My husband… he was the one who always went to the doctor. I just… followed along. He always said my heart was “strong as an ox.” But that was… a long time ago. I haven't really… paid attention since. Honestly, I'm not very good with all these medical things. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, your blood pressure is on the lower side, and I do hear some… irregularities. And you mentioned dizziness. It’s probably nothing serious, but we need to do some blood work to rule out things like anemia or a thyroid issue. It’s standard procedure. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also check your vitamin D levels. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so… not that I remember. I haven't taken much in the way of medicine in years. Just… painkillers for my arthritis sometimes. But nothing… serious. Oh! I think I had a bad reaction to penicillin when I was a child. A rash, I think. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, all these tests… Is it really necessary? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure to rule things out, Janie. And it's better to be safe than sorry. We need a baseline to understand what's going on. We can't just guess. Here’s the form for the blood work. You can go to the lab across the street. They’re open until 5 pm. Once you have the results, you can either have them faxed here, or bring them back with you. Then, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… I suppose so. Across the street, you say? I hope it doesn't take too long. I really do have things to do. Alright then. I guess… I'll go do that. Thank you… I think. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’ll get a call to schedule a follow-up. Have a good day.
