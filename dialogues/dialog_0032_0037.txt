DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pipkorn. It is very nice to meet you too. Um, well, I have been… having some trouble with my breathing. It makes a whistling sound when I try to take a deep breath. It's been happening for a few days now.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… a little tea kettle, maybe? But inside my chest. It's not painful, just… worrying. I do not like it. It makes me feel… tired, too, trying to breathe like that.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long precisely has this “whistling” been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… about four days ago, I believe. Maybe five? It was after I did some gardening. I was pulling weeds, and it was quite warm that day. But I do gardening every week, and this has not happened before.
DOCTOR: And you’ve noticed this only with exertion, such as gardening?
PATIENT: No, not only with gardening. It happens sometimes when I am just sitting and reading, too. Not every time, but… often enough that I thought I should come see you. It is more… noticeable when I am moving around, yes. But it is there even when I am resting. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mrs. Kilton. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Well, I have been coughing a little. Not a bad cough, just… a tickle in my throat. And I feel a bit… warm, sometimes. Not a fever, I don’t think. Just… not my usual cool self. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do not want to bother you with too much detail.
DOCTOR: A “tickle” and feeling “not your usual self” are rather vague, Mrs. Kilton. But we will proceed. Have you had any chest pain or tightness accompanying the breathing difficulty or cough?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And not tightness either. Just… this whistling, and the cough. And the tiredness. It's not a bad tiredness, Doctor. Just… more than usual. I do get tired easily, being my age, you understand. But this is… extra. I hope you can help me figure out what is happening. I do not like feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – perhaps asthma, COPD, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I have been very healthy my whole life, Doctor. A little arthritis in my hands, but that is all. The doctor back home, he always said I was a very strong woman. He did check my heart every year, and it was always good. I have never had any problems with my lungs, not that I know of. I do not smoke, and I have never smoked. I always ate good food, too. Or, as good as I could, living in the country as I do.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, yes. Many years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was… oh, goodness, almost thirty years ago now. And I broke my wrist when I was a young girl, but that healed up just fine. Other than that, no. No hospital stays, no other surgeries. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can, Doctor. They do not make me feel very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. It is called… naproxen, I think? The little white pills. I take one in the morning, and one at night. And sometimes, if my hands are really bothering me, I take an extra one. But that is all, Doctor. No other pills, no vitamins, nothing like that. I prefer to eat my vegetables. They are much better for you than pills, I always say.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have eaten all sorts of things in my life, and I have never had a bad reaction. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I do get a little itchy sometimes when I am around cats, but that is just a little allergy, nothing serious. I avoid cats if I can, and I am fine. I do not think that is what is bothering me now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. I’d like to listen to your lungs now, if you don't mind. Please sit back and take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds good. I am happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, particularly as you exhale. It's subtle, but present. Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated as well. Your oxygen saturation is 94% which is acceptable, but could be better. I also note some mild pallor to your skin. Do you feel any tightness in your chest when you breathe, or any pain with the wheezing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not any tightness. And not any pain either. Just… the whistling sound, and the feeling of being tired. It's like… my lungs are working too hard, maybe? I do not know how to explain it. It is not a bad feeling, but it is not a good feeling either. It is just… different. And I worry when things are different.
DOCTOR: Given your history and the findings of my examination, it is possible you are experiencing a mild exacerbation of some underlying airway obstruction. It could be something as simple as a viral upper respiratory infection causing some bronchospasm, but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to assess your lungs more thoroughly. We will also need to run some blood work to check your white blood cell count and rule out infection. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray? And blood work? Well… I do not like needles, Doctor. And I worry about the radiation from the X-ray. But… if you think it is necessary, I suppose I can do it. I want to know what is wrong. Just… please be quick with the needle, if you can. And tell me exactly what you are looking for. I always like to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Kilton. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal, and the benefits of identifying the cause of your symptoms outweigh the risks. As for the blood work, I’ll let the phlebotomist know to be as gentle as possible. The blood tests will help us assess for infection and other inflammatory markers. We will also check your oxygen levels more accurately. I'll have my assistant come in shortly to draw the blood and escort you to radiology for the X-ray. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of an inhaled bronchodilator, which should help open up your airways and ease your breathing. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: An inhaler… that sounds… good, I think. If it can help me breathe easier, then yes, that sounds very agreeable. I do not want to have to worry about my breathing all the time. And I appreciate you being so gentle with the needle. I always get so nervous. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have Sarah draw the blood, and then she will escort Mrs. Kilton to radiology. In the meantime, I'll leave you with a detailed information sheet about the inhaler, and instructions on how to use it. Once the results are back, we'll discuss them and formulate a more comprehensive treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before Sarah gets here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. And for being so patient. I worry a lot, you see. But I feel much better knowing that you are looking into this. I suppose… I will just wait for Sarah then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Kilton. Sarah will be right with you. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you experience any worsening of your symptoms while you wait. .
PATIENT: .
