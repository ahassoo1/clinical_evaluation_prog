DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic, is it?
PATIENT: Pavlovec. P-A-V-L-O-V-E-C. It's...hard to keep track of things these days, you know? Been a long time. A long time. But yes, that’s right. And you are…?
DOCTOR: Bethanie Nooruddin, Doctor. And yes, I understand things can be…difficult as one gets older. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Doctor Nooruddin. Right. Well, it’s this cough. Been…a while now. Just a dry cough. Doesn’t bring anything up, if you know what I mean. Just…hacks and scratches. Mostly worse at night. Makes it hard to sleep. I don’t even know when it started, to be honest. A few months, maybe? Longer? Everything feels…blurry.
DOCTOR: A few months, you say. And just a dry cough, nothing productive. Alright. Any fever, chills, or shortness of breath accompanying it?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. My wife…she always took care of checking those things. It's been…a few years since she passed. Shortness of breath…no, not really. I get a little winded walking up the stairs, but I always have. Old age, I guess. It's just…this cough keeps me up.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no fever, no chills, no significant shortness of breath beyond what you’d expect with age. And this cough is primarily a nighttime issue. Have you tried anything to alleviate it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My wife used to give me…some kind of syrup. Cherry flavored, I think? But I don’t have any of that now. I tried some honey once, but it didn’t really do much. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore it. It's…hard to explain. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it, and I don't really have anyone to…remind me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll need to have a listen to your chest, just to get an idea of what we're dealing with. Could you sit back and lean forward a bit?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Of course. Lean forward…right. I hope I’m not too much trouble, Doctor. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your breathing is a little wheezy, but not dramatically so. It could be some mild bronchitis, or even just age-related changes. We should also check your oxygen saturation. Nurse, could you get the pulse oximeter in here, please?
PATIENT: Oxygen…saturation? Is that…serious? My wife always said I was a healthy man, even if I did complain a lot. I don’t like machines, Doctor. They always seemed to find something wrong.
DOCTOR: It’s just a quick check, Mr. Pavlovic. It simply measures the oxygen level in your blood. It’s routine. And frankly, a little complaining is perfectly normal at your age. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? I…sometimes. My feet feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but I figured it was just from being on them too long. I used to do a lot of work with my hands, you know? Automotive work. Body repair, mostly. But it's been years since I really did much of anything. My wife…she made the best Hmong sausage. I miss that.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some ankle swelling, likely related to prolonged standing. The nurse will be back shortly with the oxygen saturation reading. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…a hard question. My wife handled all the doctor visits. I just…showed up. I think…I had high blood pressure, once? She gave me pills for that, for a long time. But I stopped taking them when she…passed. I didn’t see much point, then. And I think…arthritis in my hands, maybe? They were always stiff and sore. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at remembering these things. It all just feels like a long blur now.
DOCTOR: Right. So, history of hypertension, possibly arthritis. And you haven’t been to a doctor regularly since your wife passed. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. My wife always asked me that before giving me anything, but I don’t recall ever having a reaction. Nothing serious, anyway. Maybe a little itching sometimes? But that could have been anything. Honestly, I mostly just avoid taking pills whenever possible. They never really seemed to help much. And they always made me feel…funny.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the nurse says your oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s on the lower end of normal, but not critically concerning. Given your history of hypertension, the dry cough, and the slightly low oxygen, I'm thinking it's likely mild bronchitis, potentially exacerbated by age-related changes. However, we should rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray just to be safe.
PATIENT: A…chest X-ray? Oh, dear. Is that…necessary? I don't like those machines, Doctor. All that radiation… My wife always said I was a delicate man. Is it really that serious? Could we maybe just…try some cough syrup first?
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, it's a standard precaution. It's a very quick procedure, and the radiation exposure is minimal. I understand your concerns, but I need to ensure there isn't something more serious going on. Pneumonia, for example, can be quite dangerous, especially at your age. We’re not going to jump to any conclusions, but a chest X-ray will give us a clearer picture. I'm ordering it now. The nurse will explain where to go.
PATIENT: Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose I don’t have much choice. My wife always said I should listen to the doctors. Just…please be quick, alright? I don’t like being in hospitals. It reminds me… of bad times. And could you…explain what you're looking for? I like to know what’s going on, even if I don’t understand it all.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and check for any signs of infection, fluid buildup, or other abnormalities. We'll be looking for areas of consolidation, which can indicate pneumonia, or any signs of heart failure, which could explain the low oxygen saturation and potential ankle swelling. The nurse will take you now, and I'll review the results as soon as they're available. .
