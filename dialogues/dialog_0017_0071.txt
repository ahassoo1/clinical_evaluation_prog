DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Darryl Blim, Family Medicine. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Blim. Well, it’s about getting some shots, if you don’t mind. My daughter... she’s trying to get her husband settled here, you see. He’s coming from overseas, and she needs to know what vaccinations he needs for his visa, or to, uh, become a permanent resident, I suppose. It's a bit confusing, all the paperwork. She thought I should come talk to a doctor about it, to be sure.
DOCTOR: A rather… roundabout reason to be in a doctor's office. Visa requirements are hardly my area of expertise, Mr. Skarbek. However… if it’s simply a matter of standard vaccinations, we can address that. Do you have any documentation outlining specifically which vaccinations are required?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, Doctor. That’s the trouble. She got some information online, a whole list of things, but it’s… well, it's not very clear. Something about needing proof from a doctor here in the States, but I didn't want her to rely on just any information she found. That’s why I came to you, to get a proper understanding. I’m afraid I’m not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Online information… predictably. Very well. To avoid wasting further time, let’s start with his age and country of origin. And has he had any vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: He’s 32 years old, Doctor. And he’s coming from… let me think… Colombia. As for vaccinations, I honestly don’t know. She hasn’t mentioned anything about them. He didn't grow up with the best access to healthcare, from what I understand, so it's unlikely he had many, if any. Would there be a way to find out, perhaps? Or do we just assume he needs everything?
DOCTOR: "Assume he needs everything" is… not entirely inaccurate, given the circumstances. However, we'll proceed with a basic protocol. Has he ever had a Tuberculosis test, or a BCG vaccination?
PATIENT: Tuberculosis... BCG... I’m sorry, Doctor, those don’t ring a bell. I’ve never heard of those. My daughter didn’t mention anything about tests, or… what did you call it, a vaccination? I’m truly not much help, am I? She's usually the one who handles these things. She just thought it best to have a doctor’s opinion, to be safe. Is it very important to know if he's had these things?
DOCTOR: Mr. Skarbek, with all due respect, it is crucial to ascertain his vaccination status. Colombia has a relatively high prevalence of certain infectious diseases. Without knowing his history, we risk exposing him – and others – to preventable illnesses. We'll need to proceed as if he has no prior vaccinations. Do you have any records at all – even a small card, or a note from a previous physician?
PATIENT: No, sir, I truly don’t. He didn’t keep any records, and I haven’t seen a doctor with him, or anything like that. He lived in a very rural area, Doctor, and healthcare was… scarce. She told me it was difficult just to get basic medical attention, let alone keep track of vaccinations. I feel terrible about not knowing, but there simply wasn’t a system in place for that sort of thing. What does this mean for him, exactly? Will he need a lot of shots?
DOCTOR: It means, Mr. Skarbek, that he will require a series of vaccinations. We'll need to cover tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, influenza, and potentially others depending on his intended activities here. It’s… a substantial undertaking. Before we proceed, are you aware of any allergies he may have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. He doesn't think he has any, but he’s never really been tested for them. He grew up eating mostly what he grew himself, you see, so he wasn’t exposed to many processed foods or chemicals. He did mention once that he got a bit of a rash when he wore a certain type of wool, but it wasn't a severe reaction. Just a little itchy. Is that something we need to worry about? I apologize for being so… unhelpful. She really should have come herself.
DOCTOR: A "little itchy" is still a potential reaction, Mr. Skarbek. We will document a possible wool allergy. Now, let's move on to his medical history. Has he ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized... let me think. She did mention he broke his arm when he was a young boy, climbing a tree, I believe. It wasn't a fancy hospital, mind you. Just a small clinic in his village, but they set the bone, and it healed alright. He never had any major illnesses, as far as I know. Just the usual childhood things, a few colds and fevers, but nothing serious enough to require a long stay anywhere. He’s a pretty strong young man, really. Is this information helpful, Doctor? I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Mr. Skarbek. Now, does he have any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. He doesn't. He’s always been very active, working on his family’s farm. He eats mostly fresh fruits and vegetables, and he rarely drinks anything other than water. He’s a very healthy man, as far as I know. She said he has a lot of stamina, and never complains of feeling unwell. She worried about him adjusting to the colder weather here, more than anything. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm beginning to feel quite… flustered.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with a standard vaccination schedule, and I'll document a possible wool allergy. I need to perform a brief physical exam to establish a baseline. Please remove your shirt and shoes. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. This will take only a few moments.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. That… that sounds reasonable. I suppose it's necessary. It's been a long time since I've had a physical exam, Doctor. I hope I’m not too out of shape. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Please lie back on the examination table. I'll begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply, Mr. Skarbek. Heart rate is slightly elevated, but rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you’ll just… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Not a bit. It feels… normal, I suppose. I eat a lot of fiber, if that helps. She always says I need to watch my digestion. It’s probably just my nerves, feeling a bit tense. It’s been a long time since anyone’s poked around in my stomach like this. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No hepatosplenomegaly noted. Very well. Based on this brief examination, and your… limited medical history, we will proceed with a series of vaccinations. I’ll write out the schedule now. Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis… measles, mumps, rubella… influenza… and a varicella booster. We'll administer the first set of vaccinations today. Take this to the nursing station. They'll administer the vaccines and schedule your follow-up appointments. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… quite a list. Will these shots make him very sick? And how many will he need? She's always been the one to ask these questions... I don’t even know where to begin. And… how much will all of this cost? I have private insurance, but…
DOCTOR: Mild side effects – soreness at the injection site, perhaps a low-grade fever – are common. Serious reactions are rare. As for the number of shots… it will require multiple visits, as some vaccines require boosters. The cost… I am unable to provide a precise estimate. You will need to verify coverage with your insurance provider. I believe that covers everything. The nursing staff will provide you with detailed instructions regarding post-vaccination care. I have several other patients waiting, Mr. Skarbek. If you'll excuse me...
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I… I suppose I should go speak with the nursing staff. Thank you again for your time. .
