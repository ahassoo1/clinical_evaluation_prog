DOCTOR: Hi Ricky, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot… it’s been swelling up, see? Mostly just the one, my left one. It started a few days ago, I think maybe last Tuesday. It’s not painful painful, more like… achy, if I stand on it too long. It's just… big. Really big.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. So, the swelling started last Tuesday in your left foot, and it’s more of an ache than sharp pain, especially with standing. And you'd describe it as quite swollen. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me if anything specific happened last Tuesday that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Last Tuesday… I was helping my neighbor, Old Man Hemlock, with his garden. He was tryin’ to move a big pile of rocks for a new flower bed. I lifted a few, not huge ones, but… maybe I overdid it? I don’t remember twisting it or anything. Just…liftin’. That's the only thing I can think of. I usually don't do much lifting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, lifting rocks for Old Man Hemlock last Tuesday. That’s helpful. And you don’t recall any twisting or specific injury, just the lifting itself. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling and ache?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no chills… it's not red or hot, just… puffy. And it kinda hurts when I press on it, right here… But that's about it. I can still walk on it, but it's uncomfortable. I’ve been tryin’ to keep it off it as much as possible, but you know, gotta get around.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, redness, or warmth. Just swelling, ache with standing and pressure, and discomfort with walking. You've been trying to rest it, which is good. Let's do a quick exam of your foot and ankle. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I hope it's nothin’ serious. I don't have insurance, you see, so… I'm a little worried about costs. But do what you gotta do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about costs, Ricky, and we'll definitely keep that in mind as we go through this. We’ll discuss options if further testing is needed. Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness right here, along the inside of your ankle, as you mentioned. The swelling is definitely more pronounced on this foot compared to your right. Your range of motion is a little limited, but not severely. And your pulse feels good and strong, which is reassuring. I don’t feel any instability in the joint. It could be a sprain, or possibly some early arthritis flaring up, but we'll need to consider other possibilities. Do you have any history of arthritis, or any other medical conditions that you know of?
PATIENT: Arthritis… not that I know of. My mother had somethin’ in her hands, always complainin’ about it, but I never had problems with my joints. No, nothin’ like that. I used to be pretty active, walkin’ a lot, but I slowed down a bit after I retired. Just… normal old-man stuff, I guess. No major illnesses, no surgeries, nothin’. I try to eat okay, mostly vegetables and fish when I can get it. I don’t smoke, and I don't drink much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known arthritis, no major medical history, and generally healthy habits – that’s good to hear. Given the history and the exam findings, it sounds most likely like a sprain, possibly a mild strain. However, to rule out anything more serious, like a fracture, I’d like to get an X-ray of your foot. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. How much would that cost, Doctor? I really don’t have much money saved up. And… is it painful? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, if you know what I mean. I just… I worry about the bills. Maybe we could just… wrap it and see what happens?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry about the costs and being uncomfortable, Ricky. Let's talk about that. An X-ray here at the clinic costs $200. I know that's not ideal, and we can discuss payment options if needed. We also have a financial assistance program we can look into. As for the X-ray itself, it’s not painful at all. You’ll simply stand or lie down while a machine takes a picture of your foot. It’s quick and doesn’t involve any needles or poking. While wrapping it might provide some temporary relief, it won’t rule out a fracture, which we need to be sure of. A fracture needs to be immobilized properly to heal correctly, and delaying a diagnosis could lead to complications. I really recommend getting the X-ray just to be safe. Would you like me to go ahead and order it, and then we can talk about the cost and payment options?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You’re right, gotta be sure. Fractures sound… bad. Okay, go ahead and order the X-ray. Just… please, tell me about the payment options afterward. And maybe we can wrap it a little before I go for the X-ray, just in case it hurts when I stand on it? I appreciate you explainin' everything so carefully. It's… a little scary, bein' old and breakin’ things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ricky. I completely understand. It’s always a little nerve-wracking when something doesn’t feel right, and being cautious is always the best approach. I’ll go ahead and order the X-ray now. And yes, we can definitely wrap your ankle for support before you go. That will make it more comfortable. I'll have the technician wrap it tightly, but not too tight, and we’ll monitor it. I’ll step out to order the X-ray, and I'll be right back with the paperwork and to discuss the payment options. It won't be long. Do you have any questions for me while I'm gone?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. Just... hurry back, okay? And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man.
