DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been having trouble for weeks now. The usual stuff, you know. But it’s not going away. I’ve tried things. Over-the-counter stuff. It just… keeps happening. It’s really disruptive, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "trouble" – can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Do I have to draw you a picture? Diarrhea. Constant diarrhea. I thought that was pretty specific. And it's not just a little bit, it’s… a lot. Like, I can’t leave the house sometimes. It’s embarrassing, and frankly, it’s exhausting. I’ve been through this before, and usually it just… stops. But it hasn’t this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea for weeks. Any blood in it?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Look, I'm not one to… dwell on details. It’s just… liquid. A lot of liquid. And it smells awful, if you must know. Honestly, I've tried not to think about it too much. It's gross. Are you going to ask me about everything that comes out of me?
DOCTOR: No, no, I just need to rule out anything serious. Okay, and no fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever. No throwing up. Just… this. My stomach feels…rumbly, sometimes. And bloated. Like I ate something bad, but I haven’t. I eat pretty simple food, usually. And again, it's been weeks. I'm starting to get worried it's something… serious. But I really don't understand why it won't stop. Is there anything you can just give me to make it go away?
DOCTOR: Weeks, no fever, no vomiting…bloating. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Like I said, I eat pretty simple. Toast, mostly. And soup. Sometimes a little fish. I haven't been anywhere exotic, if that's what you're getting at. Look, I'm a pretty careful person. I don't go around eating questionable things. This isn't some kind of food poisoning thing, I can assure you. I just want this fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any family history of… digestive issues?
PATIENT: Family history? Really? My grandmother had a weak stomach, if that counts. She worried about everything. Honestly, everyone in my family worries about something. I don’t think it’s a genetic thing, if that’s what you're hinting at. I just… I'm a widow. I don’t have time for this. I need to get back to my painting. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach, feel it a little. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. And be gentle. I don’t appreciate being poked and prodded unnecessarily. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just lie back on the table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Take a few deep breaths for me. Okay… sounds are…hyperactive. Some rumbling. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little. There. And… there. It’s… uncomfortable. It feels… swollen. Like it’s going to burst. Honestly, I told you it was bad. Don’t act surprised. Is that all you’re going to do? Because I really need to get going. I have a commission due next week.
DOCTOR: Okay. Abdomen is tender to palpation in both lower quadrants, some distention. Alright. I’m going to order a stool sample, to check for any infections or parasites. And a blood test, just to rule out anything else. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… tell me where to go, and let me get it over with. The quicker this is done, the quicker I can get back to my life. I don't understand why this has to be so complicated. It’s just… diarrhea.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here's the requisition form for the stool sample. The lab is down the hall, third door on the left. The nurse will explain the collection process. And I'll have the nurse draw blood for the blood test as well. It's just to rule things out, Ms. Woodring. We want to make sure there isn't anything serious going on. We'll have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated. And we’ll go from there.
PATIENT: Fine. Hydrated. Great. You know, I think I could have figured this out myself. Honestly. Thank you. That'll be all. I need to go. Don't call me unless it's urgent. And by urgent, I mean life-threatening. .
