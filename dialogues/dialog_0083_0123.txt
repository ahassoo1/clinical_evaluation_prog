DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Not all over, really, but mostly on my arms and back. It just…itches.
DOCTOR: I see. Itchy skin can certainly be very bothersome. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this itching started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started…oh, maybe a couple of weeks ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoyance. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. It's hard to say exactly, you know? Time just…slips away when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Cassimatis. Time does seem to move faster as we get older. And it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when symptoms begin. So, it's been worsening over the past couple of weeks. Is it constant itching, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It's not always itchy, thankfully. But when it is itchy, it's a really bad itch. Like, I have to scratch it kind of itch. I try not to, because I don't want to make it worse, but sometimes I can’t help myself. It feels better for a minute when I scratch, but then it just…starts up again. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds very frustrating. And you're right to be cautious about scratching. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to make the itching worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t know if anything makes it worse, exactly. But I did switch laundry detergents recently. A new brand, one of those “eco-friendly” ones. Could that be it? I haven’t thought about that until now. I also went to visit my daughter in Florida last week – it was very hot and humid there. Maybe something with that? I don’t know, really. I just feel itchy!
DOCTOR: Okay, both the new detergent and the trip to Florida are good things to consider. We'll definitely explore those possibilities. Now, besides your arms and back, have you noticed any itching anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, just my arms and back, mostly. A little bit on my shoulders, maybe, but not much. It’s not on my legs or stomach or anything like that. And no rash, thankfully. Just…itchy skin. It doesn’t look bad, which is good, but it feels awful.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know it's localized and there's no rash. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. No fever, no tiredness, no weight loss… I haven’t noticed anything else, really. I sleep okay, eat okay… I guess I’m pretty healthy for my age, all things considered. This itch is just…new. And annoying!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get hay fever when I was a little girl, but I grew out of that. And I’ve never had any serious illnesses or surgeries. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of fish oil for my joints, that’s it. And sometimes I take Tylenol for a headache, but not very often. Otherwise, no. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I prefer natural remedies, if I can find them.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m not seeing any obvious rash or hives. Your skin appears generally healthy, though there is some mild dryness. I don’t see any signs of infection or anything particularly concerning. It's possible this is a case of dry skin exacerbated by the change in laundry detergent and the humidity in Florida. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count, or CBC, just to check for any underlying inflammation or other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. A blood test seems like a good idea. Yes, that’s perfectly alright with me. I don’t mind a little poke if it helps figure out what’s going on. Is it a lot of blood? I don’t like needles very much, you know.
DOCTOR: It's just a standard blood draw, Ms. Cassimatis – a few vials. It shouldn't be too uncomfortable, and it's over quickly. The phlebotomist is very skilled. While we wait for the results, I recommend switching back to your old laundry detergent. And try to keep your skin well-moisturized with a fragrance-free lotion. We can also try an over-the-counter anti-itch cream containing hydrocortisone. Would you like me to write you a prescription for that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A prescription for the cream would be wonderful. And switching back to my old detergent sounds like a good idea too. I should have thought of that myself! I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s nice to have someone explain things so clearly. I was starting to get really worried about this itch.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It's my job. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Here's the prescription for the hydrocortisone cream. You can pick it up at the pharmacy of your choice. And here's the lab order. You can go to the lab anytime that's convenient for you. They will contact you to schedule an appointment if needed. We should have the results back in a few days. I'll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if the itching gets significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your help. I feel much better already, just knowing what we’re going to do. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
