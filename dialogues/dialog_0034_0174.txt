DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the reason for this visit wasn’t what it is. I’m here because… well, frankly, I haven’t been feeling myself lately. Everything just feels… heavy. I’m hoping you can help. I'd like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. I understand you'd like to be efficient, and I'll do my best to respect your time. “Feeling heavy” can mean a lot of things, though. Could you elaborate a little bit on what that means for you?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. It’s difficult to explain. It’s not a physical weight, you understand. It’s… a lack of joy. Things I used to enjoy – my garden, seeing my grandchildren – they don’t…spark like they used to. I find myself…just sitting. A lot. And not wanting to do anything at all. It’s been going on for…oh, I don’t know, maybe three months now? Perhaps longer. It’s all blurring together, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. A loss of interest and pleasure in activities you once enjoyed, and increased feelings of…just sitting, as you put it. That's helpful information, Ms. Derasmo. Three months or longer is certainly enough time for us to investigate what might be going on. Before we go further, could you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in sleep… yes, there have been changes. I used to be a very sound sleeper. Now, I wake up frequently. Often in the middle of the night, and I struggle to get back to sleep. As for appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I have no interest in eating at all. Other days, I eat…comfort food, mostly. Things that aren’t good for me. I haven't lost much weight, but I’m not feeling very healthy, if that makes sense. It's all quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Derasmo. Fragmented sleep and changes in appetite alongside the loss of enjoyment are all things we need to consider. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I’ve been quite fortunate, actually. I had a bout of pneumonia years ago, but recovered fully. Otherwise, nothing major. I see my general practitioner for annual check-ups, and my blood pressure is a little high, but it’s managed with medication. I had a hip replacement about five years ago, but that healed well. I don't recall anything else significant. Honestly, I try not to dwell on these things. Is this important? I’m hoping this isn't going to be a long process.
DOCTOR: It is helpful information, Ms. Derasmo. Knowing about the pneumonia, your managed hypertension, and the hip replacement gives me a better understanding of your overall health. It doesn’t sound like there’s anything immediately concerning there. Could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, and for how long have you been on them?
PATIENT: Let me think… for my blood pressure, I take lisinopril. I believe 10 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on that for… oh, goodness, at least seven years now, perhaps longer. And occasionally, when my hip flares up, I take ibuprofen, but not regularly. Just as needed. That’s it, I think. I don't take any vitamins or supplements, and I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Is that sufficient? I really hope we're getting somewhere. This is quite draining.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Derasmo, that’s very helpful. Lisinopril 10mg daily and ibuprofen as needed. That clarifies things nicely. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any mental health conditions – depression, anxiety, or anything similar – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother was… a very reserved woman. She kept a lot to herself. I don’t recall her ever being diagnosed with anything, but she often seemed… sad. My aunt on my father’s side was… eccentric. People said she was “a bit unstable,” but I never knew the details. And my brother… he struggled with alcohol for many years. I don't know if that counts. It wasn't a cheerful upbringing, to say the least. Is that useful information? I’m not sure how much I can help with this.
DOCTOR: It is useful, Ms. Derasmo, and thank you for sharing that with me. A family history of reservedness, possible mood issues in your mother, and your brother’s struggles with alcohol – those are all things we need to consider. It sounds like there may be some predisposition, but it doesn’t necessarily mean anything definitive. One final area before we move to a physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your social situation?
PATIENT: Social situation... well, I'm divorced. Have been for many years. My children are grown and have families of their own, which is wonderful, but they live far away. I have a few friends, but we don't see each other often. I live alone. I used to be very active in my community, but I've lost interest in those activities. I spend most of my time at home, gardening when the weather permits. Frankly, it's rather lonely. I suppose that explains a good deal of this, doesn't it? I really would like to get this sorted out, Doctor. It's all very tiresome.
DOCTOR: It does help to understand the full picture, Ms. Derasmo. Living alone, separation from your children, and a loss of previous social activities – those factors can certainly contribute to feelings of loneliness and, potentially, what you’re experiencing now. Now, with your permission, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your thyroid. This will help rule out any other potential medical causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Get it over with, please. I understand it’s necessary. Honestly, I’ve had enough of talking about it. The sooner we figure out what’s wrong, the better. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let's proceed.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Derasmo. If you could please sit back and relax. Okay, Ms. Derasmo. Your blood pressure is a little high today, but it’s not significantly different from what you’ve likely experienced before. Your heart and lungs sound normal, and your thyroid feels unremarkable. I don't detect any obvious physical abnormalities. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m considering several possibilities. Given the loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, and feelings of loneliness, one strong possibility is depression. However, other conditions can mimic these symptoms, so we’ll need to do some further investigation. I’d like to order some blood work. This will help rule out any underlying medical causes, such as thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or anemia. I also want to do a urine analysis. These tests should give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex that I should be aware of before ordering these tests?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. Latex, medications...I’m fine. Just get it done, please. I’m growing impatient. Is this going to take long? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I wouldn't want to miss that. It's one of the few things I still look forward to. Though, truthfully, even that hasn't been sparking joy lately. But still, I’d prefer not to cancel.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. No known allergies. I've ordered the blood work and urine analysis. The lab technician will call you to schedule an appointment. It shouldn't take long – usually less than an hour for both tests. While we await the results, I want to ask you a few more specific questions. Have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… yes. A great deal of hopelessness, actually. It feels like…everything is pointless. I don’t see much point in anything anymore. As for self-harm… no. Never. I would never do anything like that. That’s… unthinkable. I just… feel empty. And tired. Terribly, terribly tired. Is that what you wanted to know? I find these questions…distressing. I’d rather just get a prescription and be done with it. But I suppose I understand you need to ask. It’s just…difficult.
DOCTOR: It is difficult, Ms. Derasmo, and I appreciate you answering honestly. Feelings of hopelessness are a significant symptom, and it’s important to address them. Based on everything you've told me – the loss of interest, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, feelings of loneliness, hopelessness, and the lack of any significant physical abnormalities – I am leaning towards a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. However, we need to rule out other possibilities with the blood work, and I would like to discuss some treatment options with you. Before we proceed, I want to assure you that depression is a treatable condition. Many people experience similar symptoms, and with the right care, you can feel better. Would you be open to discussing medication and psychotherapy as potential treatment options?
PATIENT: Psychotherapy... medication... I suppose. If it’ll actually help. I’ve never been one for talking about my feelings. Always preferred to keep things to myself. But if it’s necessary… then I’ll consider it. But honestly, Doctor, I’m skeptical. I've always been a strong woman. I don’t see how talking to someone is going to magically fix things. But if you think it’s worth a try… then proceed. Just… keep it brief. And don't expect miracles. I’m not one for…sentimentality. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, that is not too much to ask at all. It’s perfectly understandable that you’re skeptical, and I respect your desire to keep things brief. I’m not expecting miracles either. The goal isn’t to “fix” things, but to equip you with the tools to manage your symptoms and regain a sense of control. Psychotherapy – specifically cognitive behavioral therapy – can help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns and develop coping strategies. Medication – typically an antidepressant – can help regulate the chemicals in your brain that affect mood. I’m going to prescribe a low dose of sertraline, an antidepressant, to start. We’ll monitor your response closely, and adjust the dosage as needed. I’m also going to give you a referral to a therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. You can schedule an initial consultation at your convenience. In the meantime, are there any activities – even small ones – that you still find mildly enjoyable?
PATIENT: Mildly enjoyable… hmm. My garden, I suppose. I still potter around in there. It’s… therapeutic, in a way. It keeps my hands busy. And I do enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoon. That’s about it, really. Nothing grand. Just…small comforts. I suppose I should also mention my bridge club. Even though I’m not enjoying it as much as I used to, it does get me out of the house. Is that useful information? I’m growing rather weary of this conversation, Doctor. Perhaps we can wrap things up soon? I have a feeling I'm going to need a long nap.
DOCTOR: That is useful information, Ms. Derasmo. Maintaining those small comforts – gardening, tea, bridge – is important. They can serve as anchors during challenging times. Alright, let’s wrap things up. I’ve prescribed sertraline 25mg daily. Please start taking it tomorrow. I’ve also given you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a cognitive behavioral therapist. Her number and address are on this sheet. I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any side effects from the medication – nausea, dizziness, changes in sleep – please contact my office immediately. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to assess your response to the medication and discuss how your therapy is going. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Just… I suppose I’m a little anxious about the side effects. I’ve heard those can be unpleasant. And I’m not sure I’m cut out for all this…talking. But I suppose I’ll give it a try. Thank you, Doctor. For your time. And for listening. I suppose. I'll be going now. I'm quite exhausted.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. It was my pleasure. Side effects are possible, but often mild and temporary. Dr. Reed is very skilled and will make you feel comfortable. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And get some rest. You deserve it. Have a good day, Ms. Derasmo.
