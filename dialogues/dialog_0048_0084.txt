DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. So, you’re here today… what brought you in?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes. It’s… difficult to explain exactly. I’ve just been… feeling short of breath, I think. And my mouth and eyes are very dry. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it feels… worse lately, perhaps. I don’t… I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: "A little while now," you say. Vague, but alright. Short of breath and dry mouth. Any fever, chills, or cough accompanying that?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no chills… not really. I haven’t coughed, not a proper cough. Just… a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing major. It doesn't feel like a sick cough, if that makes sense. More… irritating. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so unclear. It's all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Foggy, yes. Well, we all have days. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, no. But sometimes… a tightness, maybe? It’s hard to describe. It doesn't hurt, precisely. More like… pressure. It comes and goes, and it’s not always there. It’s… unsettling, I suppose. I don’t know if that’s… what you mean by pain? I’m sorry. This is difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pressure, comes and goes. Any recent changes in your life?
PATIENT: Recent changes… oh dear. That's a… good question. I was… divorced last year. That was a change, I suppose. A big one. And I've been… focusing on my writing more. Trying to, anyway. I moved to a new place a few months ago, a smaller town. Other than that… not much comes to mind. I’ve been trying to keep things… simple. Is the divorce relevant? I didn't think… well, I’m not sure what’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Divorced last year, new town, focusing on writing. Stress can manifest in various ways, of course. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Let me think. No, I don’t take anything regularly. I used to, for… anxiety, a long time ago. But I stopped taking those a few years back. Nothing for blood pressure or… anything else. Just… nothing. I don’t really… like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Is that… unhelpful? I apologize. I often forget these things.
DOCTOR: No regular medications. Alright. Any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Oh. Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. No bee stings, no… funny rashes. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, and… nothing happens. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that’s… probably just the dryness. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. If you could just sit up straight for me… and breathe normally. We’ll listen to your lungs and check your… vitals. Don’t worry, it won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I'll try my best. Sit up straight… right. I hope I don’t… fidget too much. I tend to do that when I’m nervous. Is there anything I should be… expecting? I apologize for my… apprehension.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again. Hmm. Lung sounds are… slightly diminished bilaterally. Not alarming, but worth noting. Blood pressure is 128/84. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Let me listen to your heart now. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs detected. I'm going to check your throat now. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, I’m opening… wide. Diminished lung sounds… that doesn’t sound… good, does it? I apologize if I’m being… difficult. I just… worry easily. Is my throat… red? I can feel it’s a bit dry. I’ve been drinking plenty of water, I promise.
DOCTOR: Throat is mildly dry, some redness in the posterior pharynx. No exudate. Lymph nodes are… slightly palpable, but not significantly enlarged. Okay. Mildly dry throat, slight redness, minimal lymphadenopathy. It could be a simple viral upper respiratory infection, although you don’t have a cough or fever. It’s also possible this is related to… stress. Do you have any history of asthma or other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not asthma. Not that I know of, anyway. My mother… she had some breathing trouble when she was very old, but I don’t believe it was asthma. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like that. I used to be quite a strong swimmer, actually. I could hold my breath for a very long time. But… that was a long time ago. Is it… concerning that my lung sounds are diminished? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: “Diminished lung sounds” can mean a number of things. It's not necessarily alarming, but we should rule out other possibilities. Given your history and the lack of other symptoms, I'm not overly concerned about a serious respiratory infection. However, because of your report of shortness of breath, I’d like to order a chest X-ray just to be safe. And a complete blood count. To rule out anything else. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A chest X-ray… and a blood test. Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… I don’t enjoy hospitals very much. Or… tests. But if it will help… then yes, please. When will I have these… done? And will they… hurt? I apologize for my… timidity. I tend to worry.
DOCTOR: The X-ray and blood work can be done at the imaging center across the street. It shouldn’t take long, and the blood draw is relatively painless - just a quick pinch. The imaging center will schedule the X-ray. Take this with you to the lab. I'll have the results sent to me. Once I have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe chest pain, or significant difficulty breathing – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Rest, stay hydrated… avoid strenuous activity. And go to the emergency room if… things worsen. No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. You’ve explained everything very… thoroughly. Thank you, Doctor Sink. I apologize for taking up your time. I… appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Get the tests done as soon as possible. And try not to worry. .
