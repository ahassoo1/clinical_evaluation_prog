DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I’m using the machine… the one for the sleep apnea. It just doesn’t seem to be doing the whole job, if you know what I mean. I still feel tired all day, even after a full night with it on. It's a bit frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, the CPAP machine. Right. And you’ve been using it consistently, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, consistently. Every night. I wouldn't skip it. My daughter – she’s very good at reminding me, bless her – she checks the data on it, too. Says I’m getting the hours in. It’s not that I don’t use it, it’s just… I still feel like I’m dragging all the time. It's hard to explain. Like I haven't really slept, even with the mask on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the data does show consistent usage, as your daughter reports. Let’s try to pinpoint what might be going on. Beyond the daytime sleepiness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, my wife – ex-wife, now, bless her heart – used to say I snored like a freight train, before the machine, of course. That’s gone. But, I do wake up with a dry mouth sometimes. And… occasionally a little bit of a headache in the mornings, nothing terrible, just… noticeable. And I guess I haven't much energy for my garden this year, which is a shame. I always loved working out there.
DOCTOR: A dry mouth and occasional morning headaches…and reduced energy. Right. And how long have you been experiencing these headaches and reduced energy, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches and tiredness have been creeping up slowly, I'd say maybe the last… six months or so? It wasn’t sudden. It just sort of… got worse gradually. Even with the machine helping with the snoring, you see. It’s not like it was a miraculous fix, all at once. I figured it would take time, but… I expected to feel better than this by now. It’s just… lingering, this tiredness. Very frustrating, it is.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed recently… let me see. Well, my granddaughter, little Sofia, started school this year, which is lovely. Keeps me busy driving her around. And… oh! I switched to a new brand of coffee. Decaf, mind you, the doctor told me to cut back on the caffeine. Could that be it? I’m trying to remember if it was around the time things started feeling worse… Honestly, I have so many little things going on, it's hard to keep track. Everything just seems a bit… fuzzy, these days. That's probably a better word than tired, actually. Fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the new coffee could be a factor, though it seems unlikely to be the sole cause. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your throat. Then we can talk about some potential next steps. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies, thankfully. Nothing at all. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard. Just a bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes, but nothing a little bland food can’t fix. Go ahead with the exam, please. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to feel… normal again. You know? Normal. This fuzziness is just no fun.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is slightly dry, but no significant redness or swelling. Now, open your mouth and say "Ah." Palate appears normal. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72. Respiratory rate is 16. Temperature is 98.6. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal on initial examination. Now, I'd like to order some blood work. Just to check your thyroid levels and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. That “fuzziness” you described could be related to a number of things. We’ll start there.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems a good idea. Thyroid, you say? My mother had something with her thyroid, I vaguely remember. Vitamin deficiencies… well, I don't eat as well as I should, truth be told. Too much takeout these days. Alright, let's do the blood work. When should I expect the results? And… is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all? I'm trying to be proactive here, you see. Not just sit around feeling fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, your mother's history is relevant. It's good you mentioned that. The lab results should be back within three to five business days. In the meantime, I would recommend trying to incorporate more nutrient-rich foods into your diet, as you said. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Also, adequate hydration is crucial. And… despite the CPAP machine, ensure the mask is fitted properly and you are consistently using it as prescribed. If you're having any trouble with the mask itself, we can schedule an appointment with a respiratory therapist to reassess the fit. We’ll see what the blood work reveals, and then we can formulate a more concrete plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds very alright, Doctor. Fruits, vegetables…hydration…yes, I can manage that. The mask… I haven't thought about the fit in a while, actually. Perhaps it is a bit loose. An appointment with a therapist… that's a good idea. I'm happy you suggested it. Thank you. Three to five days… I’ll keep an eye on the calendar. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and not just dismiss this as “old age”. It means a lot. And… if I do remember anything else, any little detail, I’ll be sure to call. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Paske. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes to mind. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And it's never "just old age".
