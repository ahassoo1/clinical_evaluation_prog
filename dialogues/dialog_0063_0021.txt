DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's my foot, see? It's been swelling up. Not all the time, but mostly in the evenings. Feels kinda tight, too. Like my shoe's too small, even though it is a wide size.
DOCTOR: Swelling… evenings…tightness. Right. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Parascondola?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, around the end of June, I reckon. Maybe the first week of July? It wasn't bad at first, just a little puffiness. But it’s definitely gotten worse these last couple of weeks. I remember because the heat was really bad then, and it seemed to swell up more on the hotter days.
DOCTOR: Heat…interesting. And is there any pain associated with this swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. It's more like… achy. A dull ache, mostly if I've been on my feet all day. Like after work, you know? I work at the bank, sitting mostly, but still gotta walk around a bit. Sometimes, if I press on it, it's a little tender. But no sharp pain, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Any injuries to the foot recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Nothing I remember, anyway. I haven't twisted it or dropped anything on it or anything like that. I’m pretty careful, usually. I mean, I walk a lot, going to and from work, but the sidewalks are pretty level around here. I don’t go hiking or anything. Just normal walking.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the swelling, and the achiness. No fever, no redness… it doesn't feel hot to the touch, either. I haven’t noticed any numbness or tingling, and I can move my toes just fine. It's just… the foot. A puffy, achy foot. It's kinda worrying me, though, because it keeps getting bigger.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a look at it. Please, have a seat on the examination table and remove your shoe and sock. And do try to be quick about it. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Right away. Here we go… Hope it's nothing serious. It feels warm now, actually. Maybe that's just me being nervous.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see some edema present, particularly around the dorsum and medial malleolus. No significant erythema, though the skin does appear slightly warm to the touch. Palpation reveals mild tenderness, but no bony abnormalities detected. Can you point to me where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here, on this bump… and kinda up here too, on top. It's not a sharp pain, more like… a pressure. Like someone's squeezing it. And when I move my foot a certain way, it feels a little tight around the ankle. It's hard to explain. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It's… vague. We’ll need to rule out some possibilities. Do you have any history of diabetes or high blood pressure, Mr. Parascondola?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with either one. I try to eat alright, mostly fish and vegetables. And I walk a lot, like I said. I haven't been to the doctor in… well, a long time, to be honest. Just for check-ups, nothing serious. I don’t really like going to doctors, if I’m being truthful. They always poke and prod.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had bad legs, always swollen. She was from Somalia, you see, and they didn't have good doctors there, not like here. She didn't get diagnosed with anything either, just…bad legs. My father, he was healthy as a horse, though. Never sick a day in his life. Lived to be 90, he did. But my mother, she struggled. I always figured maybe it's something I inherited. Does that matter, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could. Given your mother's history and the edema, we will need to investigate for possible venous insufficiency. I'm going to order a D-dimer to rule out a deep vein thrombosis. And a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. We will also need to check your thyroid levels. It's standard procedure, Mr. Parascondola. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with any medications before. Penicillin, aspirin, nothing. Just… regular medications, I don’t really take much of anything. Is a deep vein… what was that again? Sounds serious. What does that even mean? And I don’t have insurance, so… how much is all this going to cost? I’m on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: A deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. It requires prompt treatment. The cost… I cannot give you an exact estimate, Mr. Parascondola. It will depend on the lab fees and the physician’s charges. The clinic does offer a limited financial assistance program, but I cannot guarantee eligibility. We'll draw the blood now, and a phlebotomist will explain the cost before proceeding. Do you have any medications you currently take, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, maybe. But I try to just rest when I have a headache. I really don’t take anything regularly. Honestly, I just want to know if it's something serious. Is it… is it something I need to worry about right away? Because I have to go back to work tomorrow. I can’t afford to miss work.
DOCTOR: We’ll have the results back within 24-48 hours. Until then, elevate your foot whenever possible, and avoid prolonged standing. I will also prescribe a mild compression stocking. However, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, shortness of breath, or chest pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand those instructions, Mr. Parascondola?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. Elevate my foot, avoid standing… compression stocking. And go to the emergency room if it gets really bad. Okay. What kind of compression stocking? And where do I get it? Is there a specific store I need to go to? I don't want to get the wrong kind. And...will these tests tell me what's causing the swelling, or just tell you what it isn’t?
DOCTOR: A pharmacist can assist you with the correct compression stocking grade, typically 15-20 mmHg. Any medical supply store will carry them. As for the tests… they will help to narrow down the possibilities. If those come back negative, we may need to consider a referral to a vascular specialist. The phlebotomist will draw the blood, and you can take this order to the lab. Any further questions for me, Mr. Parascondola?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all for now. Thank you… I guess. I just hope it's nothing too serious. I'll go see the phlebotomist now.
