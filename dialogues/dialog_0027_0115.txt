DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Annelle. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s about… a friend, actually. She’s been feeling quite unwell, and I’m helping her get sorted. She’s got… a yellowing, you see. Her skin… and the whites of her eyes. It’s rather noticeable. I believe it has something to do with her liver, the doctor mentioned something about hepatitis… a long time ago. I’m afraid I don’t recall the specifics. It's all a bit of a blur, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a yellowing… jaundice, we call that. And a history of hepatitis… right. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. Is your friend experiencing any other symptoms besides the yellowing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Oh dear. Let me think. She’s… very tired, I believe. And not much appetite. She’s lost some weight, though I can’t say how much. She also complains of… discomfort, a dull ache under her ribs, on the right side, I think. It comes and goes. She's not herself at all, really. It's been going on for… well, a while now. I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It's perfectly understandable. We'll take our time. So, tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and right upper abdominal discomfort… Okay. And has she noticed any changes in her urine or stool?
PATIENT: Changes… Oh, now you mention it… she did say something about her urine being… darker than usual. Like tea, she said. And her stool… well, it's been rather pale, almost clay-colored. Yes, that's right. Pale stool and dark urine. Is that… concerning? I truly don't mean to bother you with all of this, Doctor. It’s just… she’s very worried, and so am I. I’m not very good with medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: That is important information, Annelle. Dark urine and pale stools… those can be signs of a problem with the liver or gallbladder. We need to do a proper examination. Let me just ask a few more questions about her history, if you don’t mind. Does your friend drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well, she used to, years ago. But she stopped, a long time ago. Not for health reasons, then, but… personal ones. She hasn’t touched a drop in decades, I assure you. She’s always been very careful about her health, actually. This is all so strange. She's a very active woman, always has been. It’s just… baffling. I wish I could be of more help, Doctor. Perhaps I should just let her speak to you directly? She is capable, when she feels up to it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No recent alcohol use. Okay. And does she have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I believe she had a reaction to penicillin once, many years ago. A rash, I think. Nothing serious, but she avoids it now. Other than that… I honestly can’t say. She doesn’t take many medications, thankfully. Just a little something for her blood pressure, occasionally. But that’s it, I think. Oh dear, I really am terrible at remembering these things. I apologize again, Doctor. I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Annelle. You're doing perfectly fine. It's a lot to remember. Just a penicillin allergy and medication for blood pressure. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if she's comfortable with that. Just to check her abdomen and look for any signs of swelling or tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that would be fine. She’s… she’s quite anxious, so please be gentle. She doesn’t like being fussed over, if you understand. She’s a strong woman, very independent, and doesn't like to show weakness. But she'll cooperate, I assure you. She understands it's necessary. I'll stay with her, if that’s alright? Just to… hold her hand, you see. It will help calm her nerves.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Annelle. You're welcome to stay with her. Please, have her lie down on the table, and I’ll start with an abdominal exam. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment… Okay. I do detect some tenderness in the upper right quadrant, as you mentioned with the discomfort. It doesn't appear to be any acute distension. Her liver feels slightly enlarged, but that’s not conclusive. I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Specifically, a liver panel, a complete blood count, and a bilirubin level. These will give us more information about her liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. She’ll… she’ll do it, of course. Just… please be quick. She doesn’t like needles, you see. And please explain the results to me, afterwards, in… simple terms. I’m not very good with medical jargon, as you’ve probably gathered. I just want to know what’s wrong with her, and what can be done to help. I'm… I'm really starting to worry now. Is it serious, Doctor? You can be honest with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. I understand your concern, and I will be as honest and straightforward as possible. The symptoms you've described – the jaundice, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and pale stools – do suggest a possible liver problem. It could be a number of things, from a simple infection to something more serious. That’s why the blood tests are so important. They will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. Right now, I can't tell you definitively what’s wrong. We need the results of the tests. But I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get her the help she needs. I'll explain everything to you in simple terms, I promise. I’ll get the order for the blood work sent to the lab now. It usually takes a couple of hours for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend she stay well-hydrated and avoid any strenuous activity. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… please hurry. And thank you. Thank you for being so kind. It’s just… she’s all I have left. Perhaps… perhaps if I could get a call as soon as the results are in? Even if it’s bad news, I’d rather know right away. I need to be there for her. And… and if it is serious… what would happen then? Would she need to be… in the hospital? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, but I’m… I’m terrified. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I completely understand your fear. I will personally call you as soon as the results are in, no matter the time. And I will explain everything to you in detail. Regarding what would happen if it is serious… it depends on the diagnosis. If it's a severe infection, she may need to be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotics and supportive care. If it's something more chronic, like cirrhosis, we may need to consider further testing and discuss options for long-term management. But right now, it’s too early to say. We need the results of the tests first. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help her. I’m here for both of you. Please, try to stay calm. Worrying won't help. We'll face this together. Now, let me just write down my number for you, and I’ll have the nurse escort you both to the lab. .
