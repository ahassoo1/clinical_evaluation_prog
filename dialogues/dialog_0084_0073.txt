DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Voytek. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let's just get right to it. This…problem…has been going on for weeks now. Weeks! And nothing seems to help. It’s just…constant. And embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to get straight to the point, Ms. Woodring. Constant and embarrassing sounds really frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it's…diarrhea. Okay? Really bad diarrhea. I've tried everything the drugstore sells. Those things for sensitive stomachs, the stuff to…stop things up…nothing works. It just keeps happening. Several times a day. And it's not just a little upset, it’s…explosive. Honestly, I’m starting to feel ridiculous even coming here. I mean, it’s diarrhea. What are you even going to do about diarrhea?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. It sounds very unpleasant, and I appreciate you telling me how it's impacting you. It's definitely valid to seek medical attention for something that's going on for weeks and isn't improving, even if it feels…basic. We need to figure out why it's happening. When did this start exactly?
PATIENT: Around…the beginning of July, I think. Maybe mid-July? Honestly, it all feels like one long, miserable blur at this point. It started gradually, just a little rumbling, then…not good. And it hasn't let up. I thought it was something I ate at first, but I’ve changed my diet completely and it’s still happening. It’s just…constant. Do you need a specific date? I really don’t remember.
DOCTOR: No, mid-July is fine. We can work with that. And it’s good you tried adjusting your diet—that helps us narrow things down. Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Stress. Everything makes me stressed these days. Running my own painting business, dealing with…well, everything. It’s a lot. And when I’m stressed, it just…flares up. But then not being stressed doesn’t fix it either, so I don’t even know anymore. It's like my stomach just decided to betray me. Is that even a thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, that is a thing. Stress can absolutely wreak havoc on your digestive system. Okay, so stress seems to be a factor. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Like what? I just have…this. I mean, I’m tired, obviously. Dealing with this all day is exhausting. And I haven’t been very hungry. It’s hard to want to eat when you know what’s going to happen afterwards. No fever, no…blood, thankfully. Just…a lot of running to the bathroom. Is that enough information? I feel like I’m explaining something incredibly stupid.
DOCTOR: No, you're not explaining something stupid at all. This is important, and it's good you're sharing this with me. No fever or blood is good. Loss of appetite makes sense given everything that's happening. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Ugh, not really. I was a pretty healthy kid. Had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing serious. I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago, that’s…it. And I take a multivitamin. Oh, and I'm allergic to penicillin, if that matters. I’m not a big fan of doctors, so I don’t usually go unless something is really, really wrong. Which, apparently, this is.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy ten years ago, penicillin allergy, and a multivitamin. Good to know. Do you have any family history of digestive issues, like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really know. My family isn’t…big on talking about health things. My mom was always…private. And she passed away a few years ago. I don’t know anything about her side of the family, really. My dad…he was more interested in fishing than doctor’s visits. So, no, I don’t have any information about that. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can work with that. Let's talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good lord, no. I run a business, I don't have time for that. I have to be up early, painting. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a weekend. That’s about it. And definitely no smoking. I can’t stand the smell of it. I need to be able to breathe when I’m up on a ladder. Honestly, I’m pretty boring.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Just a glass of wine occasionally. Okay. I’m going to ask you a few questions about your recent travels, if you’ve done any. Have you traveled outside of the country in the last six months?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I haven't left the state in years. I’m too busy. Besides, all this…stuff…started before any travel would have been possible. Honestly, even thinking about a vacation right now feels exhausting. I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent travel. Alright, Ms. Woodring, I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now… Do you feel any pain anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: A little. Right…there. And a little bit on this side too. It’s not sharp, just…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been like that for a while now, actually. I just figured it was stress. Everything hurts when I'm stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that tenderness. And I'm listening for bowel sounds now…They’re a bit…hyperactive. Which makes sense given everything you’ve described. Alright, Ms. Woodring. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing acute diarrhea. Given the duration and the lack of fever or blood, it’s less likely to be a serious infection, but we do need to investigate further to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a stool sample to check for parasites and bacteria. I also want to do some blood work to check your electrolytes and rule out any inflammation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: More tests. Great. Look, I don't understand any of that. All I know is I feel awful and I need this to stop. But…fine. Tests. Whatever it takes. Just tell me how to do the…stool sample thing. And how long will it take to get the results? I really can’t be out of commission for long. I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. We'll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I’ll have the nurse give you instructions and a kit for the stool sample. It's a fairly simple process – you’ll collect a small sample in the provided container and bring it back to the clinic. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. In the meantime, I want you to focus on staying hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, electrolyte drinks. And avoid dairy, greasy foods, and sugary drinks. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable, I guess. Water and…not eating things. Fantastic. Look, if it's nothing serious, can I just…go back to work? I really can’t afford to lose any more time. I have a client breathing down my neck. And if it is serious…what then? I don't even want to think about that. Just…tell me what to do with the sample and I’ll get it done. Hopefully, it's just something stupid.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. The nurse will go over the instructions for the stool sample. If the tests come back negative, we can discuss strategies for managing stress-related diarrhea, like dietary modifications and potentially a referral to a therapist. If the tests do reveal an infection or another issue, we’ll discuss appropriate treatment options. I'm going to write you a note for work excusing you for a few days while we wait for the results. And please, don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s everything. Just…get it over with, okay? I have a business to run. And honestly, I'd rather be painting. Just…please hurry. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. We'll get everything processed as quickly as possible. The nurse will be right in with the stool sample kit. And please, take care of yourself. .
