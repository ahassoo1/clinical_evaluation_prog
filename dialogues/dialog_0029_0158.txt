DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it's about this… letter. For a pet, you see. Some place needs a letter saying I'm a suitable owner or something. It's all a bit much, really. I just want to get it over with. I don’t even remember why I need it, specifically. Something about an apartment, I think?
DOCTOR: Right, I see here… a pet suitability letter for your apartment complex. Okay. And you're not experiencing any health concerns yourself today?
PATIENT: Health concerns? No, not really. I mean, I'm fine. Perfectly fine. Don't see what that has to do with a dog, though. I just need the paper. Is this going to take long? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, the apartment complex requires a basic health assessment to ensure you're capable of providing adequate care for the animal. It’s fairly standard. Just a few quick questions, and a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. It shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I get sniffles sometimes, but everyone gets sniffles, don't they? Dust, probably. Or maybe it's the weather. Honestly, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. Why would that matter for a pet? Is this doctor a bit… thorough?
DOCTOR: It's to rule out anything that might impact your ability to care for a pet long-term, Ms. Wrye. For example, a compromised immune system could make you more susceptible to certain animal-borne illnesses. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. Oh! I take something for my… joints. Sometimes. When they bother me. It's a little blue pill. I can't remember the name of it, though. My daughter used to get it for me. She handles all that now. It's probably something common. Don't worry about it. Really, I'm quite healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any significant medical history – any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me things I haven’t thought about in years. Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was little. That's about it, I think. And… something with my back, a long time ago. I slipped on the stairs. It was terribly embarrassing. But it healed. I don't even remember exactly when it was. Things just… fade, you know? Are we getting anywhere with this letter?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. Can you step up on this stool for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical, fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I haven’t had a proper check-up in ages. My daughter says I'm fine. She’s a very sensible girl. Don't poke too hard, though. My joints aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, please, Ms. Wrye. In and out. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's take a look at your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, bending knees… There we go. A little creaky, if I'm honest. It's the weather, I tell you. Always affects my joints. Is that enough bending for you, Doctor? I don't want to pull anything. Honestly, all this fuss over a little dog… It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness and crepitus in both knees. Range of motion is limited, but not severely. Do you experience pain with walking or climbing stairs?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Not all the time. It's more of a… discomfort, really. A little ache. And stairs are… challenging, let's just say that. I take my time. And I don't run up them, if that’s what you're asking. I don't do a lot of running these days. Are we getting closer to this letter, Doctor? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while you appear generally healthy, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and you do describe some joint discomfort and limited mobility. While you are capable of caring for a pet, I would recommend following up with your primary care physician for a more thorough evaluation of your blood pressure and joint pain. We can write the letter stating you are medically cleared to own a pet, but I want to ensure your own health is prioritized. Would you like me to draft that letter now?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. Yes, please, just write the letter. As long as it gets me what I need. And really, I do take care of myself. I eat reasonably well and I don’t overexert myself. A little ache in my joints is hardly a medical emergency. And my daughter worries too much anyway. Just… get the letter done, Doctor. I’ll think about seeing another doctor. Maybe.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Wrye. This letter states you are medically cleared to own a pet. I’ve also included a note recommending you follow up with your primary care physician regarding your blood pressure and joint pain. It’s just a precaution, of course. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well... is there a fee for all this? And I really don't think I need a lecture on seeing another doctor. I'll think about it. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Wrye. The fee will be billed to your insurance. Have a good day. .
