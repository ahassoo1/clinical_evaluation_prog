DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes. Well, my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for...a little while now. Not a serious thing, I don't think. Just…annoying. I work, you see, and can't be sick. It’s a very important job, separating things. Very precise. I just need to know it's nothing…bad.
DOCTOR: "Separating things," hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. Chemicals, mostly. And…other things. It’s…complicated. You wouldn’t understand. It requires…attention to detail. And a strong constitution. Really, I just need something for the pain. I haven’t been sleeping well either, because of it. It’s probably just a cold, though. It has been humid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, even “just a cold” can disrupt things. Let's get a little more information, just to be thorough. You said it's been hurting for a “little while now”… can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh dear. That’s…difficult. A week, maybe? Perhaps a little longer. Everything feels so…muddled lately. It started gradually, you see, not suddenly. Just a scratchiness, and then it got…worse. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to dates. I have things to do. It's not like I have time to keep a calendar of my ailments. Really, doctor, is this necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Ottaviani. Understanding when things started and how they progressed helps me figure out what's going on. If it truly is “just a cold,” that’s one thing. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. It comes and goes. Mostly worse in the mornings, when I wake up. And when I…talk a lot. Which I have to do, you see, explaining things to the…others. They aren't very bright, most of them. And it's…uncomfortable when I swallow. Like sandpaper. Is that a good enough description? I really don’t see the point of all these questions, but if you need to know… there you have it.
DOCTOR: Sandpaper is…a very descriptive way to put it, thank you. And it is helpful. Morning pain and discomfort with swallowing… alright. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh, I haven't taken my temperature. I don't have a thermometer. And frankly, I don't feel…hot. I’m usually rather cool, actually. My late husband, bless his soul, always said I was a cool cucumber. I haven't felt…ill enough to worry about a fever. Just…annoyed. And tired. Is it possible to be tired without having a fever? I suspect that’s all this is. Just exhaustion. From…everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, it is absolutely possible to be tired without a fever. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think…well, my appetite hasn’t been very good. But that’s probably just because of…everything. And I’ve been a bit…short-tempered, I suppose. But really, who wouldn’t be? Dealing with…people all day. And the noise. It's terribly loud in the factory. Is that a symptom? Being irritable? I shouldn't be complaining, I suppose. I have a job, when so many others don’t. It’s just…everything is a bit much lately. Really, doctor, I don’t see what any of this has to do with my throat.
DOCTOR: It can all be related, Ms. Ottaviani. Stress can certainly affect your body, and it can make existing issues worse. Let's move on. Any cough?
PATIENT: A cough? No. Not really. A little tickle sometimes, but nothing…productive. Just a…small irritation. Really, it’s barely noticeable. I wouldn't even mention it if you hadn’t asked. It’s just…everything is irritating lately. I’m beginning to think you’re trying to irritate me with all these questions. I mean, I came here about my throat, and we're discussing my…temperament. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Ottaviani, I am not trying to irritate you. I need to gather information to make an informed assessment. A simple throat pain can have many causes. Now, have you noticed any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty…breathing? No! Of course not. I breathe perfectly fine. Always have. I walk to work, you see. It’s a long walk. And difficulty swallowing…well, it’s uncomfortable, as I said. Like sandpaper. But not…difficult. I can still eat, I can still drink. I just…don’t particularly want to. Is that a symptom? A lack of appetite? I really think I’m wasting my time here. I should be at work. Things need…separating. Honestly, doctor, are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Ms. Ottaviani. And I understand you're frustrated. But I need to rule out anything serious. Before we dismiss this as “just a cold,” I'd like to take a quick look at your throat, just to be thorough. It will only take a moment. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to look at my throat? After all these questions about my temperament and appetite? Fine. Fine. But don’t expect to find anything. It’s probably just a little…irritation. Hurry up, please. I have things to do. And try not to poke around too much. It’s rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are a little swollen. No visible exudate. Hmm. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged as well. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs just to be safe. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: A deep breath? Fine. Honestly, I don’t know why you’re doing all this. It's just a sore throat. My late husband always said I worried too much. He was a very practical man. Always knew the right thing to do. And he wouldn't have wasted time with all these…tests. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get back to work. Things aren't going to separate themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Okay. Ms. Ottaviani, while your lungs sound good, the redness in your throat, the swollen tonsils, and the enlarged lymph nodes suggest a possible infection – likely viral, but we can't rule out strep throat without a test. I recommend a rapid strep test. It’s a quick swab, and we’ll have results in a few minutes. It’s best to know for sure so we can get you the right treatment if needed.
PATIENT: A test? Another test? Honestly, doctor, this is ridiculous. Strep throat? I haven’t been ill in years. And I certainly don’t have time for tests. I have responsibilities, you see. Important responsibilities. I separate things. Very precise work. It requires…concentration. I can’t be wasting time in a doctor’s office. Honestly, I think I’ll just go home and take some aspirin. That’s what my late husband always did. He was a very sensible man. And he didn't bother with all these…complications. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand your frustration, but dismissing potential strep throat without testing could lead to complications. If it is strep, it's important to treat it with antibiotics to prevent rheumatic fever. That’s a serious condition. I strongly recommend the test. It’s a quick and simple procedure. If it’s negative, you can go home and take aspirin, as your husband suggested. But we need to rule it out first. I also want to discuss your fatigue and irritability. While stress may be a factor, those symptoms can also be associated with underlying medical conditions. A simple blood test could help us get a better understanding. Would you be open to that as well?
