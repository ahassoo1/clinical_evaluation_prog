DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, it’s… down there. Somethin’s leakin’. It’s… not right. Been happenin’ a little while now. Don’t know what to do about it. It's... messy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Genard. It takes courage to discuss these matters. When you say “leaking,” could you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's... kinda slimy. And it smells funny. Not a good smell, you know? Like… old fish, maybe? I dunno. It gets on my… you know… my underthings. I keep havin' to change. It's just… bothersome. It ain't like it used to be, that's for sure. Back in my day… things were different.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite distressing, and you’re right to seek attention for it. The change you’ve noticed is important. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me when you first started noticing this leakage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… when did it start? Let me think… a while now. A couple months, maybe? Hard to say, really. Things kinda blur together when you get old, you know? I think it started after… after that fella left. He wasn't a good one, that one. Always rushin' things… Maybe it has somethin' to do with him. I don't know nothin' about all that, though. Just started happenin' and it's been botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Genard. It's helpful to understand the timeline, and I appreciate you mentioning that detail. It’s possible there’s a connection, but we'll focus on understanding what's happening medically. Now, is this leakage constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Not all the time. Sometimes it's worse than others. Like, after I… well, after I use the bathroom, mostly. And when I get real warm, you know? Like after workin' in the garden. I do a lot of plantin', keeps me busy. But then… then it happens. And it's just… unpleasant. I try to keep things clean, but it's hard when it keeps… happenin’.
DOCTOR: I see. So it seems to be related to urination and activity. Has there been any burning or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burnin’? No, not really burnin’. Not like a fire, you know? Maybe a little… sting sometimes. But nothin’ bad. Mostly just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s not right. And… well, down there itches sometimes too. Real bad. I try not to scratch too much, but it's hard. I use that lotion, the one with the aloe, but it don't help much. It’s just… a bother. A big bother.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Ms. Genard. The itching is also important information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently – any constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now you're askin’ a lot! Bowel habits… let me think. Well, I get a little… stopped up sometimes. Happens when I eat too much mango. Love my mango. But I take them… them little pills, you know? The ones for regularity. They work okay, mostly. No blood, no, nothin’ like that. Just… old lady problems, I guess. Everything gets slow when you get old. That's just the way it is.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re addressing the constipation, Ms. Genard. And you’re right, changes do happen as we age. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes… let me think. The doctor, back when my husband was still alive, he said somethin’ about my sugar bein’ a little high, once. But he didn’t say nothin’ about pills or anything. I just ate less sweets. And… well, I had the flu real bad a few years back. Stayed in bed for a week. Other than that… nothin’ much. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just aches and pains, you know? Old lady stuff. I never really liked goin' to doctors, to be honest. They always poke and prod. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Genard. We’ll try to make this as comfortable as possible. So, you mentioned some elevated sugar levels in the past, but haven’t been formally diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: That's right. Just once, the doctor said somethin' about it. He never wrote nothin' down, though. Just told me to cut back on the coconut cake. I did, for a while. But then… well, coconut cake is so good! I don't really worry about it much, to be honest. I just take things easy and try to enjoy life. I don't want to spend my days frettin' about every little thing. It just ain't worth it. But this leakin’… that’s botherin’ me. It's just… messy and unpleasant. And I don’t know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you prioritize enjoying life, Ms. Genard. However, the leakage is a legitimate concern that we should investigate. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations, aside from the flu you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think real hard. No, not really. Not surgeries, no. When I was a little girl, I broke my arm climbin' a mango tree. But that was a long time ago. They just put a cast on it. And… well, I had my babies, of course. But that wasn't surgery, exactly. Just… natural. Other than that… nothin’ much. I’ve been pretty lucky, I always say. I never liked bein’ poked and prodded. It always made me nervous. This whole thing is makin' me nervous, to be honest. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Genard. We’ll do our best to make you comfortable. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes… family history. That's a tough one. My mama, she died when I was young. From somethin' with her heart, I think. And my papa, he smoked too much. Got somethin' with his lungs, they said. My brother, he had high blood pressure. But other than that… not really. Lots of us just… get old and pass away. It's just the way it is. Not much talkin’ about sickness in my family, you know? Just try to live a good life and hope for the best. This whole thing is makin' me tired, to be honest. I just want to know what's wrong and get it fixed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Genard. It’s helpful to have that information. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just them little pills for regularity, like I said. And sometimes I take that ibuprofen for my arthritis. When it's real bad. But that's about it. Not much else. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of fruits and vegetables. And I drink plenty of water. I don't like takin' a lot of pills, you know? Makes me feel sick. This whole thing is makin' me anxious, to be honest. I just want to go home and relax. I've been answerin’ questions for a long time now.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Genard, and I appreciate your patience. We’re almost finished with the initial questions. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes when I brush the bougainvillea, but that's just the flowers. Not a real allergy, just… itchy. And I don’t really eat fancy foods, so nothin’ to be allergic to there. Just fruits and vegetables and rice. Simple stuff. I try to avoid trouble, you know? This whole thing is makin' me frustrated, to be honest. I just want to know what's wrong and get it fixed so I can get back to my garden. Can we get to that now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, we absolutely can. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. Now, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and then a gentle internal exam to assess the source of the leakage. It may be a little uncomfortable, but I will be as gentle as possible. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam. You mean… down there? Well… I don’t like that part. Never liked it. But… if you have to, I guess. But please, be gentle. And quick. I don't like bein' poked and prodded. And… and explain what you’re doin’, okay? I get nervous easy. Just… be gentle. And quick. And tell me what you find. I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I completely understand your apprehension, and I promise to be as gentle and thorough as possible. I will explain everything as I go. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. This just helps me get a general sense of your overall health. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to lie on the examination table, with your knees bent and feet flat. I'll use a speculum to gently examine the vaginal area. This will allow me to see if there's any inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities. I will use lubricant to make it more comfortable. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'm carefully inserting the speculum now… I'm visualizing the vaginal walls… I do notice some mild redness and a small amount of discharge. It doesn't appear to be any signs of a major infection, but I see some mild thinning of the vaginal tissues, which is common with aging. I will also perform a brief palpation of your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Alright, Ms. Genard, that's all done. I apologize for any discomfort. Based on the exam, I suspect this leakage is likely due to a combination of age-related changes in the vaginal tissues and possibly some mild urinary incontinence. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a urine sample to check for infection and a simple blood test to check your sugar levels, as you mentioned some concerns about that in the past. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a lot. But… if you think it’s necessary. Thinning tissues… that sounds old. And I don't like the sound of incontinence. Does that mean I can't hold it? Oh, dear. Okay, a urine sample and a blood test. But please, no more pokin’ and proddin’. I’m tired. And… and can you explain what all this means? Like, what can I do about it? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Genard. It's completely normal to feel worried when you're not sure what's going on. "Thinning tissues" is a common change that happens with aging, especially after menopause. It can make the vaginal area more sensitive and prone to irritation. And "incontinence" simply means a loss of bladder control. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't hold your bladder at all. There are different degrees of incontinence, and many treatments available. Based on what I’ve seen so far, it appears to be mild. The urine sample will help us rule out a urinary tract infection, which can sometimes cause leakage. The blood test will help us check your sugar levels and ensure there aren't any underlying issues contributing to your symptoms. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Options might include pelvic floor exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder, topical estrogen cream to help restore some of the vaginal tissue thickness, or, in some cases, medications to help control bladder function. We will take things one step at a time. First, let's get the urine sample and blood test done. Then, we'll review the results and discuss your options in detail. I'll explain everything clearly, and we'll make a decision together. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises… like… squeezin’? I’ve heard about that. But those other things… cream and pills… I don’t like takin’ pills. And cream… sounds messy. Oh, dear. Okay, fine. Urine sample and blood test. But… can I get a list of those exercises? And… how long will the tests take? I don’t want to be waitin’ forever. And… will this be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. I just… I want to feel better, but I don’t want a big bill. It’s just… a lot to deal with.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a lot to deal with, Ms. Genard. And it’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about cost and waiting times. Yes, pelvic floor exercises – often called Kegel exercises – involve squeezing the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. They can be very effective in strengthening the bladder muscles and reducing leakage. I can provide you with a handout with detailed instructions and diagrams. We can also discuss them during a follow-up appointment. The urine sample and blood test should take approximately 3-5 business days to come back. The lab will send the results directly to me, and I will contact you as soon as I have them. Regarding the cost, I understand you do not have insurance. I will discuss the costs with the billing department and see if we can arrange a payment plan or explore any available financial assistance programs. I can also provide you with a detailed estimate of the costs for each test and any potential treatment options. I want to be transparent and ensure you’re comfortable with the financial aspect. Let's start by getting the lab requisitions for the urine sample and blood test. My nurse, Maria, will take you to the lab and explain the process. Once you’ve had the tests done, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a personalized treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… manageable. Maria, you say? Is she nice? I don't like nurses who poke too much. But… a payment plan would be good. And if you can explain everything clearly, that would be helpful. Okay, Maria. Let's get this over with. But… just be gentle, okay? Everything's achin’ today. And… thank you. For not makin’ me feel too foolish. It's hard gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Genard. It’s my pleasure to help you. Maria is wonderful – very kind and gentle. She will take excellent care of you. And I promise to explain everything clearly, every step of the way. It is hard getting old, and you are not foolish at all. You’re a strong woman for coming in to address this. Maria, could you please come in and assist Ms. Genard with getting the lab requisitions for the urine sample and blood test?
