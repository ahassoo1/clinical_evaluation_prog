DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Osterholm. It’s… well, it’s my eyes, mostly. They’ve been really bothering me when I’m outside. Like, super sensitive to the light. It’s gotten worse over the last few months, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sensitive to light, you say. Okay. And when you say "bothering," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly. More like… everything is just really, really bright. It makes me squint a lot, and sometimes I get a headache after being in the sun for even a short time. It feels like I need to shield my eyes constantly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… vague, but I suppose. And how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started really subtly, maybe around… November last year? But it was just a little bit then. Barely noticeable. It really started getting bad around… February, I guess? And it's definitely worse now, with the sun being stronger. It’s been pretty consistent since then, just… getting a little bit worse each month.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see... February… you saw Dr. Ramirez for a cold then, nothing about eye complaints. And you’re 32, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, 32. And yes, that was just a regular cold. Nothing to do with my eyes. I hadn’t really noticed the eye thing then, I suppose. It was slow to come on, like I said. It's just… frustrating, you know? I like being outside.
DOCTOR: Well, everyone likes being outside. That's hardly a medical symptom. Let’s try to focus. Have you noticed any changes in your vision other than the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry! You’re right. I get carried away sometimes. Let’s see… Changes in vision… Hmm. Not really blurry vision, no. But sometimes things look… washed out, maybe? Like the colours aren’t as bright as they should be. And I think I’m having trouble seeing in dim light. Like at night, it takes me a while to adjust when I go inside. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Washed out colors, difficulty seeing at night… Any family history of eye problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mum… she wore glasses, I think. For reading mostly, when she got older. And my grandfather, on my dad’s side, he had glaucoma, I think it was. But I’m not totally sure. My dad didn’t really talk much about it. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember a lot of details.
DOCTOR: Glaucoma… Right. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just some over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, for headaches. Nothing regularly. And I’m allergic to penicillin, if that matters. Is this something serious, Doctor? I'm a little worried.
DOCTOR: It's probably nothing… but we’ll take a look. Let's do a quick examination. I’m going to check your visual acuity and look at your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It won't take long. Just follow my instructions.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I’ll just do whatever you need me to do. Let me know if I need to look in a certain direction or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I want you to read the smallest line you can on this chart. Cover one eye, please. Which eye doesn’t matter to start. Tell me what you see on each line, starting from the top.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Let's see… top line is… E, F, P, T… second line is… Z, V, Q, Y… third line is… H, R, L, B… fourth line is… X, C, 8, D… Oh, this one is getting harder… fifth line is… F, P, 6, D… and I think… I can sort of see a G, but it’s blurry. That’s about as far as I can go. Is that what you wanted?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Visual acuity is… approximately 20/40 in that eye. Now, cover the other eye. Let's see how that one does. Same thing. Read the smallest line you can.
PATIENT: Okay… this one… Hmm. Top line is the same… E, F, P, T. Second line… Z, V, Q, Y. Third line… H, R, L, B. Fourth line… X, C, 8, D… and… Oh, this is… worse. I can barely make out the X. And I definitely can't see the C or the 8. I think that’s it for this eye. It’s much blurrier.
DOCTOR: Alright. 20/70 in that eye. Now, I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes to look at the back of your retina. It might be a little bright, just try to relax and look straight ahead. Don't blink if you can help it. Hmm… Okay… Interesting.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m trying to relax. It is pretty bright. Is everything alright? What are you seeing? You said “interesting…” That doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: Well… It could be nothing. But I’m seeing some mild optic disc pallor in both eyes. And a few drusen. It’s… subtle. But it suggests early signs of age-related macular degeneration, and possibly some early glaucoma. It’s not an emergency, but it needs monitoring.
PATIENT: Oh. Wow. That’s… a lot. Macular… degeneration? And glaucoma? I’m only 32! Is that… common? What does “monitoring” mean? Will I… go blind? I'm sorry, I'm just… a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Well, “common” is a relative term. It’s uncommon at your age, yes. But not unheard of. Especially with family history. As for “monitoring,” it means we’ll need to do regular check-ups – visual field tests, OCT scans of your retina, and measure your intraocular pressure. It’s to see if it’s progressing. As for going blind… it’s unlikely if we catch it early and manage it properly. But you need to be diligent about your appointments. I’m going to order some baseline tests. And I’ll give you a referral to a specialist, an ophthalmologist. They’re better equipped to handle this than I am. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, I think so. Regular check-ups, tests, and… a specialist. An ophthalmologist. That sounds… complicated. But okay, I’ll do it. Whatever I need to do. Will Medicare cover all of this? The tests and the specialist? I don’t want to get stuck with a huge bill. And… how often do I need to go for these check-ups? Is it every year?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the basics, yes. But you’ll need to check with them directly about specifics. As for how often… the ophthalmologist will determine that based on your test results. It’s likely every six months to a year initially. I’m printing out a referral form now. And here’s a list of ophthalmologists in the area. Choose one and make an appointment as soon as possible. Honestly, it’s probably just a slight variation of normal aging. But better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I'll… I'll call and make an appointment with one of these specialists as soon as I can. I hope it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, don't wait too long. And try not to worry too much. It’s probably nothing serious. Have a good day.
