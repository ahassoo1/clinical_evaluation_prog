DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I'm a family medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I came because… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe when I lie down. It just… feels like something is pressing on me. I don’t know if that makes sense. I’d like to get it checked, if you don’t mind. I haven’t been feeling quite right for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Difficulty breathing when lying down is certainly something we should investigate. It's good you came in to get it checked. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Well, it started… oh, maybe a month ago? I noticed it when I was trying to read in bed. I usually lie flat, but then I felt like I couldn't get enough air. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… tightness in my chest. And I have to use more pillows now to prop myself up. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’d like to get back to sleeping comfortably, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began about a month ago, associated with lying flat, and is relieved somewhat by using pillows. You describe it as tightness, not a sharp pain. Is this tightness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It's worse at night, definitely. During the day, if I'm sitting up or walking around, I hardly notice it. But the moment I lie down… that's when it starts. And it can wake me up sometimes, needing to adjust my pillows. It’s not every night, but often enough to be a worry. I haven’t done anything to bring it on, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: So, it’s primarily nocturnal, worsening when lying flat, and doesn't seem to be triggered by any specific activity. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this tightness – perhaps any cough, wheezing, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No cough, Doctor. And no wheezing that I’m aware of. My ankles… now that you mention it, they have been a little puffy lately. Not terribly so, just… noticeable. I thought it was the heat, to be honest. We’ve had such warm weather. I haven’t paid it much mind. But yes, a little swelling. Nothing painful, just… there. I do try to keep my salt intake down, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild ankle swelling. That’s good information. Have you noticed any palpitations or a rapid heartbeat associated with this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Palpitations… hmm. Let me think. No, not exactly palpitations, but… sometimes I feel like my heart is beating a little faster when I’m trying to catch my breath. Not a fluttering, just… more aware of it, I suppose. It doesn’t last long, and it doesn’t happen every time I have trouble breathing. But yes, occasionally. Is that important, Doctor? I do try to stay calm, but it's difficult when you can’t breathe properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional awareness of a faster heartbeat. We'll want to investigate that further. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure years ago, but it’s been managed with medication for a long time. I take a small dose every day. As for diabetes… no, the doctor told me I was pre-diabetic once, but I changed my diet and it went away. No heart problems, as far as I know. I had a regular check-up last year, and everything seemed fine then. I'll have to think if I can remember the name of the doctor who did it. I move around a bit, you know. Different doctors over the years.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We can look that up if needed. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Every morning. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s over-the-counter, Ibuprofen, I think it's called. I don't take it every day, only when my joints are bothering me. I try to avoid it if I can. It doesn't always help much, anyway. I’d rather just rest when my arthritis acts up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin daily and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, probably thirty years or more. That was the only surgery I’ve ever had. As for being hospitalized… I was in the hospital once for pneumonia, a long time ago. But that was before the blood pressure medication, I think. I haven’t been seriously ill since then, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, you know. I eat a good diet and I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and a previous case of pneumonia. Now, thinking about your family… do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any history of heart problems, lung disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, just like me. And she had a stroke when she was quite old. My father… he was healthy as a horse, never had a day of illness. And my brother, he’s still alive, but he doesn’t take care of himself like he should. He smokes, unfortunately. As for lung disease or blood clots… not that I’m aware of. We didn’t talk about medical things much in my family, if I’m honest. It wasn’t considered polite, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension and stroke. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve never had a reaction. I can wear any sort of jewelry, and I haven't had any trouble with pollen or animals. I’m quite fortunate, really. I think I’m rather plain in that regard. Are we almost finished with the questions? I’d like to get this sorted out, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: We are almost finished. Just a few more quick questions, then we'll do a physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. Not a drop of alcohol, and I certainly don’t smoke or use any… recreational drugs. I always thought those things were bad for you. My mother always said moderation was key, but I prefer to avoid them altogether. I drink plenty of water, though. And herbal tea. Is that alright, Doctor? I hope you don’t mind. I just want to be clear, I try to live a very clean life. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, we are finished with the questions. Thank you for being so thorough. It sounds like you do indeed take very good care of yourself. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles. Then we can discuss possible causes for your breathing difficulties and what steps we can take to figure out what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I’m ready when you are. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s a little worrisome, you know, not being able to breathe properly. Let's get started, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a nice, deep breath in... and out... good. Now another one... and out... Okay, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/88. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some faint crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Your ankles have mild pitting edema, as you mentioned. Based on what you've told me and what I'm hearing, it sounds like you may be experiencing some fluid buildup in your lungs, which is causing your breathing difficulties. This could be related to your high blood pressure, or it could be something else. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and possibly some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out other causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think that's necessary, then I trust your judgment. I'd like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. Chest X-ray and blood work… I can certainly do that. Will they be able to do it here at the clinic? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge game on Thursday, you see, and I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do both the chest X-ray and the blood work right here at the clinic. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the blood work will take about ten. We usually get the X-ray results back within an hour or so, and the blood work results typically take a couple of days. I'll have the nurse draw your blood first, and then we'll send you over to radiology for the X-ray. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your breathing gets significantly worse, or if you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anyone you'd like me to contact after the tests?
PATIENT: That sounds very efficient, Doctor. I appreciate that. I think I can manage on my own for now. I don’t have any close family nearby. My brother lives in California, but we don’t talk much. No need to bother him. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I’d like to get this resolved quickly, if possible. I do worry about these things, you know. And I really don't want to miss my bridge game. It's the highlight of my week. Can we go ahead and do the blood work now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll get the ball rolling right away. I'll have the nurse, Sarah, come in and get you started with the blood work. She'll explain everything to you. I'll also have her schedule a follow-up appointment for you for next week, just in case. Sarah, could you please come in and draw some blood for Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking such good care of me. It’s a relief to know I’m in capable hands. I do hope it isn’t anything too serious. I try to stay healthy, as I said. But… one never knows, does one? I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. And try not to worry too much. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll do everything we can to figure this out. Just relax and let us take care of things. I'll be right next door if you need anything at all.
