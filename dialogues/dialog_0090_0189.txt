DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… well, my business. Been seeing a bit of red when I go to the bathroom, you understand? Not a pleasant sight, I can tell you that. And at my age, one expects these things, but still… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Red in your stool, you say. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… not terribly long, thankfully. Maybe… a week? Give or take a few days. I don't spend that much time analyzing it, you know. It’s not like I’m looking for patterns. Just noticed it, and it bothered me, so here I am. Waste of a good morning, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: A week. Okay. And is it bright red, like fresh blood, or darker, maybe more… maroon in color?
PATIENT: Bright red. Definitely bright red. Like… well, like you’d expect blood to look. Not some old, murky color. It's… concerning, that’s what it is. I’ve lived a long life, seen a thing or two, and I know what fresh blood looks like when I see it. It’s not something you miss.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood. And how much blood are we talking, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, now don’t go asking me to measure it! I’m not a plumber, you know. It’s… enough to notice, alright? Enough to make one worry. Not a Niagara Falls, mind you, but not a tiny speck either. A good… a good tablespoon, maybe? Though I haven’t actually measured it. Honestly, I’d rather not think about it any more than I have to.
DOCTOR: A tablespoon. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits at all?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to go. Sometimes it’s easy, sometimes it isn’t. Happens when you get old. But no, nothing… drastically different. Regular as clockwork, mostly. Though perhaps a little… softer, now that you mention it. But that could be the peaches. I had a particularly good batch this year.
DOCTOR: Peaches, alright. And any abdominal pain, cramping, or discomfort with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… a little bit of a grumble in my gut sometimes. Nothing to write home about, though. I’m an old man; things ache. Probably just gas. Or the peaches. Honestly, you’re asking a lot of questions about… well, private matters. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to gather information, Mr. Rowbottom. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that's a good question. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. I like my food. I suppose… maybe a pound or two? But that could be the heat. It’s been awfully hot this summer. And when you’re my age, a pound or two feels like a lot. Honestly, I’m not one for weighing myself all the time. It just depresses me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my arthritis, now and then. Ibuprofen, mostly. Nothing fancy. And allergies… not that I know of. Never been one for sniffles and sneezes. I’m a tough old bird, you know. Lived a good life without needing a bunch of pills and potions.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to do a quick examination, Mr. Rowbottom. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. If you'll just lie down on the table, please.
PATIENT: Examination, is it? At my age. Honestly. Fine. Get it over with. Don’t poke around too much, mind you. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. No obvious masses or tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, but… Bowel sounds are present, though a little sluggish. I’m going to need to check a stool sample to determine the source of the bleeding. And I’d like to order a complete blood count, just to rule out anemia.
PATIENT: Sluggish, you say? Everything’s sluggish when you get old! Honestly. A stool sample? Do I have to collect it myself? That’s… undignified. And a blood count? All this for a bit of red in the toilet bowl? Seems a bit much, if you ask me. I suppose… I suppose I can do it, but I’m not happy about it. Just get it over with quickly.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Rowbottom. We need to rule out any serious underlying causes. I'll provide you with the necessary containers and instructions for the stool sample. As for the blood count, it’s a simple test, and it will give us valuable information. I’ll have the nurse explain everything to you. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully. And please, try not to delay getting the samples collected. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you say. Standard procedure, is it? I suppose you have to earn your money somehow. Honestly. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results. And tell the nurse to speak up, my hearing isn’t what it used to be. I think I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day.
