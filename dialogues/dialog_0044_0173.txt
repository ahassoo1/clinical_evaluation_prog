DOCTOR: Hello Jailenne, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Asami, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been getting these chills lately, and it’s a bit worrying. Not a fever, just… cold. It's been on and off for a couple of days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills that come and go for a couple of days. That’s good information. Can you tell me a little more about those chills?
PATIENT: Hmm, okay. It’s not like a shivering cold, more like… I just feel really cold inside, you know? Like I need a blanket even when it’s warm. And it comes and goes throughout the day. Sometimes I’ll be perfectly fine, and then suddenly I just feel…brrr. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything specific, honestly. I haven’t been out in the cold or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, feeling cold inside despite being warm, and it's not tied to any specific activity or temperature. That’s helpful. Do you have any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, like I said. I haven’t really been coughing or sneezing. Maybe a little tired, but I usually am, to be honest. Work’s been busy. Oh! And my muscles ache a tiny bit, but that could just be from lifting boxes at work. It’s hard to say. I don’t think there’s anything else, but I’m trying to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, or sneezing. Some tiredness, and muscle aches which could be work-related. Let's explore the tiredness a bit more. When you say tired, is it just feeling generally worn out, or something more specific?
PATIENT: It’s more like… just completely drained, you know? Like I could sleep for a week and still not feel rested. It’s not just after work, it’s all day. Even on my days off, I feel like I have no energy. I try to drink lots of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It's a bit frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand, that sounds really draining. Okay, so constant fatigue, even on days off. Let's take a quick look at your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. Nothing major, thankfully. I had really bad tonsillitis when I was a kid, but those were removed years ago. And I broke my wrist once, but that healed fine. Other than that, no. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I do have some… anxiety, but I manage it with some relaxation techniques, not medication. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Anxiety is definitely relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. And no other chronic medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the tonsils when I was little, like I said. Nothing else. It was… a long time ago. I don’t really remember much about it. I was pretty young. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly fine. It doesn't sound like that's relevant now. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, let me think… My mum has high blood pressure, she’s managing it with medication. And my grandfather, on my dad’s side, had diabetes. Other than that, I don’t think so. No one else really has anything major. Everyone else seems pretty healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, mum with high blood pressure and grandfather with diabetes. That's good information. And now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I don't smoke at all. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I try to live pretty healthy, honestly. I eat reasonably well and try to get some exercise when I can, even if it's just a walk. It’s just… hard sometimes with work.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs, and you try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. I've tried a lot of different foods over the years, and nothing's ever bothered me. Wait... I think I get a tiny bit itchy sometimes after eating shellfish, but it’s not a serious reaction, just a little itch. It doesn’t happen every time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a very mild itch after shellfish sometimes, but not a serious reaction. That's good to note. Alright, Jailenne, thank you for that information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just to check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I hope it’s not anything serious. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, let’s take your temperature. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. Blood pressure is 128/80, slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Finally, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Everything feels normal there as well.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s reassuring. It’s just… everything feels off, you know? Even if everything seems normal. What do you think it could be? Is it my anxiety, maybe? Or something else?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when things don't feel right even when tests are normal. It could be related to your anxiety, as anxiety can cause a wide range of physical symptoms. However, the chills and constant fatigue are worth investigating further. To rule out some common causes, I'd like to order some blood work. We’ll check a complete blood count to look for signs of infection or anemia, a thyroid panel to see if your thyroid is functioning properly, and a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can cause fatigue and muscle aches. We'll also check your electrolytes. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again. Vitamin D… I don’t think I get enough sun, to be honest. I work indoors all day. Is it a lot of blood? I don’t really like needles.
DOCTOR: It's not a lot of blood, Jailenne. Just a few vials - probably less than a teaspoon altogether. And I understand your aversion to needles. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to make it as quick and painless as possible. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, try to get a little bit of sunlight if you can, and focus on getting enough rest and hydration. Are you able to take some time off work to rest?
PATIENT: I think I can take a day or two. My boss is usually pretty understanding. I'll try to get some sun, but it's been so cloudy lately! Thank you, Dr. Asami. I really appreciate you listening to me and taking this seriously. It helps just knowing we're trying to figure it out. Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? Or will you just call me when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I can help. It’s important to feel heard and to have a plan. We’ll give you a call as soon as the results are available, usually within 48 hours. You don't need to schedule a follow-up appointment right now, but we can if the results show something that requires further discussion. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – especially if you develop a fever, severe muscle aches, or any difficulty breathing – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Dr. Asami. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I'll wait for the call. I think I'll go home and try to get some rest. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. You take care of yourself, and try to get some rest. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day as well.
