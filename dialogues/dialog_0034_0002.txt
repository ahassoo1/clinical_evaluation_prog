DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, it’s… going to the bathroom. It’s just… hard now. Not painful, exactly. Just… takes a long time, and I don’t always… get it all out, you know? It’s been going on for… a little while now, I think. I forget how long exactly. My husband, he notices it more than me, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with emptying your bladder, and that it's been gradual in onset. It’s also helpful to know your husband has noticed it as well. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, emptying… that’s a good way to put it. It just… dribbles sometimes after I think I’m done. And I have to… push a little, you know? Not hard push, but… more than I used to. I don't know if that makes sense. And I seem to be going to the bathroom more often, especially at night. Waking my poor husband up… I feel bad about that. Does that… explain it better? It’s hard to talk about, sorry.
DOCTOR: It absolutely explains it better, Ms. Stoffregen, and please don’t apologize. These things are difficult to talk about, and you are doing a good job describing what you're experiencing. The dribbling, the feeling of needing to push, and the increased frequency, particularly at night – those are all important details. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your urine stream itself?
PATIENT: Urine stream…? Oh dear. What do you mean? Is it… different colored? I haven't been paying attention to the stream part, just if I go or not, you know? It looks… normal, I think. Yellow. Sometimes darker if I haven't had enough water. Is that what you mean? It doesn't hurt when it comes out, if that makes a difference. I just… have trouble starting sometimes. It takes a minute. Does that help? I'm not good with… descriptions.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. You're doing just fine. You mentioned it takes a minute to start, and that's very helpful. And no pain, that's good to know. When you say it takes a minute, does it feel like you have to strain to get it started, or does it just… delay a bit?
PATIENT: Oh… strain… yes, maybe a little. Not hard straining, like when you're… constipated, you know? Just… like I have to think about it. And then it comes, but it’s not as strong a stream as it used to be. More… gentle. And I have to go again not long after, even if I don't feel like I have much left. It’s… frustrating. And my husband says I’m fidgeting more, trying to… get it all out. He’s a good man, always noticing things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of hesitancy, a weaker stream, incomplete emptying, and frequency. The fact that your husband has noticed the fidgeting is also useful information. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, ask away, Doctor. No fever, no chills. My back… sometimes aches a little, but I'm an old woman! That's just… old age, I reckon. And my abdomen… no pain, not really. A little… gassy sometimes, but everyone gets that, right? Nothing serious, I don't think. I haven’t felt sick, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… tired a lot of the time. But that's probably just getting old too, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s good to know there’s no fever, chills, or abdominal pain. And yes, fatigue can certainly be a part of getting older. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… That’s a long time ago now. Let me think… My doctor, he used to say my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. He put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it when I retired. Too many pills, you know? And… I think I had a touch of the sugar, they said, but it went away. Nothing serious, he said. I mostly just try to eat healthy and take it easy. My husband does the remembering for most of it, though. He’s very good at that. Does that help? I'm sorry, I'm not very good with all these details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It's helpful to know about the past high blood pressure and the history of elevated sugar levels, even if they were in the past. We can always look up records if needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… Let me think… Years ago, when I was younger, I had my gallbladder out. And… I broke my wrist once, silly thing, falling in the garden. But that was a long time ago. And… I was in the hospital when I had my first baby, of course! But that was… well, a very long time ago. Nothing else, I don’t think. My husband might remember if there was anything else, but I'm mostly just trying to keep my mind blank these days, you know? Too much to remember as you get older. Is that helpful? I'm sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the broken wrist is good to have. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a little something for my arthritis, you know, for my hands. It helps with the stiffness. And sometimes I take a little something for my sleep, just when I can’t get to sleep. My husband gets worried when I toss and turn all night. Other than that… no, not really. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Too many side effects, you know? I get a little something from the chemist when my stomach's upset, but that's just when I need it. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Knowing about the arthritis medication and the sleep aid is helpful. Before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask about any allergies you might have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I eat most things. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the dust, you know? Old house. And I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications, not that I remember. My husband says I'm pretty lucky, haven’t got any of those fancy allergies. But I could be wrong, I suppose. My mind isn't what it used to be. Does that help? Sorry if I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. No known allergies is good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a gentle examination of your lower abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Listening and checking… gentle examination… yes, alright. I don’t mind. It’s just… I get a little cold easily these days, you know? Maybe you could keep the paper on me? And… please be gentle, my skin is a little thin. But yes, go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable. I'll keep you well-covered and be as gentle as possible. Okay. I'm listening to your abdomen now. I don't hear anything concerning at this point. Now, I'm gently pressing on your abdomen. Do you feel any pain or discomfort in any particular area?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s alright so far. Just… a little pressure, you know? Not painful, exactly. But… right there… … feels a little… tight. Not painful, but… firm. Like a little knot, almost. It’s hard to explain. And… when you press, it feels a little… sensitive. But it’s not bad, Doctor, don’t worry. Just… different than the rest. And… is that all you need to do? I get a little cold easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s very helpful. I do feel a mild fullness in that area, and it's good to know it feels sensitive to the touch. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes in your legs. This is just to make sure everything is functioning properly. Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, I'm going to ask you to bear down, as if you are trying to have a bowel movement. This will help me assess your pelvic floor muscles. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… bearing down… yes, alright. I can do that. Diminished reflexes… what does that mean, Doctor? Is that bad? Is it something to worry about? And pelvic floor… oh dear. I haven’t thought about my pelvic floor in… well, a very long time! But yes, alright. I’ll try. Is that right? Is that enough? I'm a little embarrassed, you know. Old woman and her pelvic floor… It’s a bit silly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. You’re doing great, and there’s no need to be embarrassed. Diminished reflexes simply mean that the signals traveling between your nerves and muscles are a little slower than they used to be, which is very common with age. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem, but it’s something we consider as part of the overall assessment. And you did a great job bearing down. I noticed a slight descent of the bladder, which is also common with age and can contribute to the symptoms you're experiencing. Based on everything you’ve told me and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with a combination of bladder outlet obstruction and pelvic floor weakness. These can often happen together as we age. It’s important to rule out other potential causes, however. I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection and a post-void residual measurement to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bladder outlet obstruction… and pelvic floor weakness… That sounds… complicated. And post-void residual… Is that going to be… unpleasant? I’m a little worried, Doctor. Is it something serious? And complicated… I just want to be able to go to the bathroom without… all this fuss. Urine analysis and residual… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please be gentle, you know? I’m an old woman. Just… tell me what I need to do. And… is it going to take long? I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. It does sound complicated, but we’re going to take it one step at a time. The urine analysis is a simple test where we collect a urine sample. The post-void residual measurement involves using a small, sterile device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It's not painful, but it can be a little uncomfortable. It should only take a few minutes. The purpose of these tests is to rule out infection and to get a better understanding of how well your bladder is emptying. Based on the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Often, simple exercises, lifestyle modifications, or medication can help manage these symptoms. Before we proceed, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… exercises? Lifestyle modifications…? That sounds… manageable. Not like surgery or anything scary. Yes, alright. Exercises and modifications… I can try. And not surgery… that’s good. Hmm… yes, one question. Will these tests tell me why this is happening? Is it just… old age? Or is there something else wrong? And… will it get worse? I don't want to end up… you know… needing help with everything. That’s my biggest worry, I think. Losing my independence. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Stoffregen, and very valid concerns. The tests will help us determine the likely cause of your symptoms. While age is a significant factor, other things can contribute, such as changes in muscle strength, nerve function, or even prior childbirth. The tests can help rule out other potential causes and give us a better idea of the underlying mechanism. As for whether it will get worse, that depends on several factors. Often, early intervention with exercises and lifestyle modifications can help slow or even reverse the progression of these symptoms. We'll monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. We will also discuss options for managing your symptoms if they do worsen, but our initial goal is to help you maintain your independence and quality of life. Now, let's get started with the urine sample. I’ll provide you with a sterile cup and instructions. Then we’ll move on to the post-void residual measurement. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Urine sample and residual… Yes, let’s get it over with. The sooner we know, the better, I suppose. Hopefully, it’s not too bad. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so patiently. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I appreciate that. Just… tell me exactly what I need to do. I don’t want to mess anything up. And… where is the bathroom?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. The bathroom is just down the hall to your left. I’ll provide you with a sterile cup and instructions for collecting the urine sample. It’s important to collect a midstream sample, which means you’ll start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. After you’ve collected the sample, I’ll guide you through the post-void residual measurement. It involves using a small, sterile device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. Here are the instructions. Please let me know if you have any questions or need any assistance. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call me if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. Midstream… I think I remember that from… well, a long time ago. I’ll go try. And… I’ll call if I get stuck. Don’t worry, I’m not afraid to ask for help.
