DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Galena. It’s…nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s about some shots I need. My daughter… she’s trying to get her husband’s family over from overseas. They need certain vaccinations, and she thought I should come see a doctor to figure out exactly what all is required. It’s a bit confusing, all of it.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations, right. Yes, that can be…a bit of a puzzle. Okay. So, to clarify – these are vaccinations for travel by your daughter’s husband's family?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. They are coming to visit, and then hopefully stay here with us. My daughter is handling most of the paperwork, but she said it's best if I come in and talk about what shots they need, based on where they’re coming from. It has something to do with…requirements for the visa, I believe. She mentioned something about needing proof, and you being able to provide that. I hope that makes sense. I'm not very good with all these official things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Visa requirements…right. Okay. And do you happen to know where they’re traveling from specifically?
PATIENT: Let me see… My daughter told me… they are coming from the Philippines, I believe. Yes, that’s it. The Philippines. She said something about needing different shots depending on which islands they are from within the Philippines, but I didn't really follow all of that. It all sounded very complicated.
DOCTOR: The Philippines… right. Yes, that can be…detailed. Okay. Now, just to get a full picture…have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Not recently, no. It’s been… a long time, I suppose. I had the usual ones when I was younger, you know, as a child. And maybe a tetanus shot or two over the years. But nothing in a very long time. And truthfully, I don’t have a good record of what I’ve had. It was a while ago, and things weren’t kept as carefully then. Does that make things difficult?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon, Mr. Skarbek. Records aren’t always easy to come by. We can work around that. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small pill, every morning. My regular doctor prescribed it, years ago. It keeps things… stable. I can’t recall the name right off hand, I’m afraid. I have a bottle at home if you need to know exactly what it is. It’s nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication…okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m a pretty simple man. No food allergies, no bee stings…nothing like that. My wife… she was the one with allergies, always having to carry an EpiPen. But I’ve always been…lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, before we get into the specifics of vaccinations for your daughter’s family, let's just do a quick check of your vital signs. Just routine, you understand. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure…that sort of thing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I understand it’s all part of making sure everything is right. I appreciate you taking the time to help me sort this out. It's a relief to finally be talking to someone who knows what they're doing. It all felt so overwhelming before.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Skarbek. That’s what I’m here for. If you’ll just have a seat here, and we’ll get started. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure. Then we can discuss what vaccinations your daughter’s family may need.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. I'm ready when you are. I hope I don't make too much noise breathing; I sometimes get a little…wheezy in the mornings. Just an old habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a nice, deep breath…and exhale. Good. And again…yes. I do hear a little bit of wheezing, as you mentioned. Not terribly concerning, but we’ll make a note of it. Blood pressure is…142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your medication. Now, just a quick look in your ears…open wide, please.
PATIENT: Alright, I’m opening wide. I always thought my ears were a decent size. My wife used to say they were quite prominent. She liked that. Is everything alright in there? I hope I don't have too much wax. I haven’t really thought about it much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Everything looks clear, Mr. Skarbek. A little wax, as you suspected, but nothing significant. Alright. And just a quick palpation of your lymph nodes… No swelling or tenderness…good. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam for now. Now, let’s talk about those vaccinations…do you have any idea where within the Philippines your daughter’s family will be traveling from specifically?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. My daughter mentioned something about… Mindanao, I believe. Yes, that's right. Mindanao. She said it's a larger island, and that the requirements might be different there than other parts of the Philippines. I don't know much about it, to be honest. She said something about… different diseases being more common there. Is that correct? It all sounded very complicated.
DOCTOR: Mindanao…yes. That does add a bit of complexity. Okay. According to this, given travel to Mindanao, we should consider vaccinations for Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and potentially Japanese Encephalitis, depending on the length and type of travel. Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis should be up-to-date as well, and it’s always a good idea to have influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Have you had any of those vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot of names. I honestly have no idea, Doctor. I haven’t kept track of any of that. Like I said, it’s been a long time since I’ve had any shots. I suppose I should have, but… well, life gets in the way, you know? Are those all necessary? It sounds like a lot to… endure. And are they expensive? I'm on a fixed income, and I wouldn't want to put too much strain on my savings.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Skarbek. It is a lot to consider, and cost is always a factor. Let’s prioritize. Hepatitis A and Typhoid are highly recommended for travel to Mindanao, as they are transmitted through contaminated food and water. Tetanus is a booster we should definitely update, regardless. Japanese Encephalitis is more dependent on the length of stay and the specific areas visited within Mindanao. We can discuss that further. As for cost, your insurance should cover a significant portion of these vaccinations. We'll need to verify your coverage and determine any out-of-pocket expenses. Let me check your insurance benefits…just one moment. Now, do you have a copy of your insurance card with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here you are, Doctor. It's a fairly new card, I think. My daughter helped me switch over to this plan last year. She said it was a better option for me. I mostly just trust her judgment, to be honest. She's very good with these things. I hope the information is clear enough. I'm not very good at reading all the fine print.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me see… Yes, this plan does cover vaccinations. There is a small co-pay for each shot, but it’s fairly reasonable. Hepatitis A will be about $30, Typhoid $25, and Tetanus $20. Japanese Encephalitis, if we decide to proceed with that, will be a bit more expensive, around $150 for the series. So, based on this, the initial cost would be around $75 for Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and Tetanus. We can discuss the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine further once we’ve determined the length and itinerary of your daughter’s family’s trip. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, I suppose. $75 isn't a terrible amount, all things considered. I think it would be best if I just went ahead and got those three shots done, then. Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and Tetanus, you said? And then we can talk about the Japanese Encephalitis one later, if it seems necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it's important, I'm willing to consider it. I just want to make sure my daughter's family is safe when they come to visit. When can we get these done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Skarbek. We can administer those three vaccines today, if you’d like. It’s best to get them all at once, to expedite the process. They can be a little tender afterward, and you might experience some mild fatigue, but that usually resolves within a day or two. I’ll need you to sign a consent form for each vaccine, and then we’ll proceed. Here you are. Just read through them carefully, and let me know if you have any questions. You can fill those out there, and I’ll be right back to assist you.
PATIENT: Alright. I’ll do my best to read through these carefully. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so it might take me a little while. Hopefully, they aren’t too complicated. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Skarbek. I’ll be right here if you have any questions at all. Don't hesitate to call out if you need me to clarify anything.
PATIENT: Doctor? I’m a little confused by this section here… it mentions something about possible side effects. What exactly are those? I'm not very good with medical jargon. It says something about…anaphylaxis. That sounds…scary.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern, Mr. Skarbek. Anaphylaxis is a very rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. It’s why we always monitor you for a short period after the injection. The symptoms include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, and dizziness. However, it’s extremely uncommon, and we are fully equipped to handle it if it were to occur. The vast majority of people experience only mild side effects, such as soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, or fatigue. We take every precaution to ensure your safety, and we'll be monitoring you closely throughout the process. Does that help to clarify things a little?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, thank you, Doctor. Knowing that you're prepared for it… that makes me feel a lot better. It's just… I haven't had a shot in decades, and I'm a bit nervous about everything. So, if it's so rare, do most people still get them? Are they worth getting if the risk is so small? I don’t want to needlessly expose myself to something dangerous.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Skarbek. Even though anaphylaxis is rare, the diseases these vaccines protect against are much more common, especially in areas like Mindanao. Hepatitis A and Typhoid can be debilitating, and even life-threatening, if contracted. These vaccines significantly reduce your risk of contracting these illnesses, and the benefits far outweigh the small risk of a serious allergic reaction. We also screen you beforehand to identify any potential allergies or contraindications that might make you unsuitable for vaccination. Think of it as a preventative measure, a way to safeguard your health and ensure you can enjoy your time with your daughter's family without worry. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense. Protecting myself from getting sick… so I can enjoy time with my family. You're right. I hadn't thought about it that way. If it's better to be safe than sorry, then I guess it's worth it. Alright, Doctor. Let's go ahead and get it done. I trust your judgment, and I want to be healthy for my daughter’s family. Where do I need to sign?
DOCTOR: Excellent decision, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad we could discuss your concerns. Right here, please, on each form. And then we’ll get you settled for the injections. Wonderful. Now, if you’ll just roll up your sleeve…we’ll get started. It will be just a quick pinch, and then you’ll be all done. I'll explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here we go. Just… try to be quick, if you would. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a quick pinch… there we go. All done. See?
PATIENT: Ouch. That was a pinch! Not terrible, though. Is that…all of them? I'm hoping I won't feel too awful later.
DOCTOR: Just one more… there we go. All done. And that’s it. Two quick pinches, and you’re all set. Yes, that was all of them. You might experience some mild soreness at the injection sites, and perhaps a low-grade fever or fatigue, but that usually resolves within a day or two. Here, drink some water. And just relax here for about 15 minutes. I’ll be monitoring you to ensure you don’t have any adverse reactions.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm just glad it's over. I feel a little… achy already, but I suppose that's to be expected. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and making me feel comfortable. It means a lot. Do I need to do anything special after this? Like, avoid certain foods or activities?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad we could get through that together. No, nothing special. Just take it easy for the rest of the day, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activities. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you experience any discomfort. And if you develop any unusual symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or a high fever, please contact me immediately. Everything looks good so far. Just continue to relax for a few more minutes, and then you’re free to go. I’ll give you a copy of your vaccination record to keep for your records, and I’ll also send a copy to your regular doctor. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You really put my mind at ease. Having that record is helpful, though. I'll be sure to keep it safe. I'm just glad I got it done. Now I can focus on getting ready for my daughter's family's visit.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This document details the vaccinations you received today, including the date and type of vaccine. Keep this in a safe place, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. I’m glad I could help, Mr. Skarbek. Enjoy your time with your daughter's family. And if you ever need anything, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful day! .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
