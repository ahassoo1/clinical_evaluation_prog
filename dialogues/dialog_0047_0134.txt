DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kelder. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it's been my stomach, mostly. I just don't feel right, you know? I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's been going on for a little while now, but it feels worse lately. I… I can’t really remember when it started, exactly. It just sort of is.
DOCTOR: Right. “Stomach not feeling right,” nausea, early satiety… and you say this has been going on for “a little while.” Hmm. It’s often helpful to pinpoint when things started, if possible, but we can work around that. Can you tell me more about the nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, well, it’s not… violent, usually. More like a queasy feeling, all the time. It comes and goes, but it’s there. And it doesn’t always mean I throw up, just… feel like I might. It's worse after I try to eat, I think. Not always, but a lot of the time. It’s just… unpleasant. I mostly just try to eat small things, but even then… Sometimes it doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: Queasy feeling, intermittent, not always associated with vomiting, worse after eating… Okay. And you mentioned you're eating smaller portions now. What sorts of things are you able to keep down, generally?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… Toast, usually. And… soup. Broth, mostly. Not chunky soups. Just… clear broth. And… sometimes applesauce. But not much else, really. I used to love a good roast chicken, but that just doesn't sound good anymore. It's hard to say what will be okay on any given day. It just… doesn’t feel good, you know? Everything feels heavy.
DOCTOR: Right. So, limited diet – toast, broth, applesauce. Things that are easily digestible. And a general feeling of heaviness. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – any heartburn, bloating, changes in your bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, heartburn… sometimes. Not terrible, but it’s there, a little burning feeling. And… I think I have lost some weight, yes. My clothes feel a bit looser, but… I haven’t really been weighing myself. I just haven't had much appetite, so I figured that was it. Bloating… not really. And my… well, everything’s pretty regular, if you know what I mean. I haven’t noticed any changes there. Though… everything feels slow, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heartburn, some weight loss, feeling of slowness… We’ll need to explore this a bit further. Now, Mrs. Kelder, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a hard question. I’ve been to the doctor a fair bit over the years, you know. My age… things wear out. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And… I had some trouble with my heart a few years back, but they gave me some medicine and it seemed to help. And… Oh! And cancer. They… they told me I had cancer. A while back. I had… treatments. But it's all a bit fuzzy now. I don't remember what kind.
DOCTOR: Right. Gallbladder removal, some heart trouble… and a history of cancer. That’s… important information. Do you recall where the cancer was located, or what type of cancer it was?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I really don’t. They just told me I had it. And then they gave me… pills. And something with a needle. It was at the hospital, of course. I remember being very tired. And my husband… he was there. But… the details are just gone. It feels like a long time ago, and… everything was so stressful. I’m sorry. I wish I could tell you more. I just remember being grateful they were helping.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kelder. It's understandable that details are hazy after something like that. We can often find records of past treatments. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than what you might have taken for the cancer previously?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just this. For my blood pressure. And… sometimes a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But not every day. It's… Lisinopril, I think it's called, for the blood pressure. And… oh, I forget the name of the arthritis one. It's a little white pill. I get it at the pharmacy. That's all, I think. Unless… sometimes I take something for sleep, but only when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril for blood pressure, something for arthritis as needed, and something for sleep occasionally. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. My husband always said I was lucky that way. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m not allergic to cats, though! I love cats. But medicine… no, I don't think so. I've taken a lot of things over the years and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Mrs. Kelder, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Just a routine check to get a better sense of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I'm an old woman, I'm used to things creaking and groaning!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me. Take a deep breath… and another… Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly diminished. Take a deep breath in… and out… Lungs are clear. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. It’s just… a little soft, I suppose. Not hard or anything. It feels… empty, if that makes sense. Ooh, maybe a little there. Just a tiny bit. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It comes and goes, really. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant… slightly guarded. Tympanic throughout. Bowel sounds are… present, but somewhat hypoactive. Alright, Mrs. Kelder. Given your history and these findings, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better picture of what's going on. We'll check your liver function, your kidney function, and do a complete blood count. It will also be good to check your electrolytes. We might also want to consider an abdominal ultrasound, to get a closer look at your gallbladder and liver. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… thorough. Blood work and an ultrasound… Is it serious, Doctor? Is it the cancer again? I just… I don’t want to go through all that again. It was so tiring last time. I just want to feel better, you know? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Mrs. Kelder. The tests are simply to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. The tenderness in your right upper quadrant, combined with your history of cancer, warrants further investigation. It could be related to your previous cancer, but it could also be something else entirely. We need to rule things out. The ultrasound will give us a better visual understanding, and the blood work will give us some important clues. It's important to be proactive, but I don't want to cause unnecessary alarm. We're simply gathering information at this point. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk. They'll schedule you for the blood work, and we can arrange the ultrasound for later this week. Do you have any specific concerns about either of those procedures?
PATIENT: Oh… well, no, I don't think so. Blood work is just… a prick, right? And the ultrasound… is it safe? I've heard things… But if you think it's best, I trust you, Doctor. I just… I wish my husband was here. He always knew what to ask. He was a very practical man. But… yes, go ahead with the tests. I want to know what’s going on. And I just… I hope it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is very safe, Mrs. Kelder. It uses sound waves, not radiation. And yes, it’s understandable to feel anxious. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible. I'll also write you a prescription for some anti-nausea medication to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. It’s not a cure, but it should provide some relief. Do you have any allergies to medications that we've discussed?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no allergies that I know of. I told you, I'm a very lucky woman! Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not… scaring me too much. I appreciate it. I just want to feel like myself again. Do you think… do you think it's possible I could feel better soon?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible, Mrs. Kelder. Once we have the results of these tests, we’ll have a much clearer understanding of what’s going on and can develop a plan to address it. I’m cautiously optimistic that we can find a solution to help you feel better. In the meantime, please take the anti-nausea medication as directed, and try to rest. I’ll have the lab orders and the prescription sent to the front desk. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough. Thank you again. I just… I hope it's nothing too serious. But I trust you to take care of me. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mrs. Kelder. Please let the front desk know if you have any trouble scheduling the tests. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. .
