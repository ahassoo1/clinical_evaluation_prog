DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just...a cough. Been on me for a while now. And I get tired real easy, and my sinuses…they feel clogged up a lot. It’s just getting old, I guess. I want to get it sorted if I can, don't want it dragging on all winter.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and sinus congestion. And you said it's been going on for a while… can you tell me roughly how long “a while” is?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think...probably close to three, maybe four months now. Started mild, just a tickle, but it’s gotten worse, especially in the mornings. And the tiredness…that’s been building up slow-like, but I really notice it now when I’m at work. It's hard to keep going some days.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months. And it’s worse in the mornings, and you're experiencing increasing fatigue. Do you notice anything that specifically makes the cough worse – like being in cold air, lying down, or being around certain things?
PATIENT: Yeah, cold air definitely gets to it. And...dust, I think. Working in the plant, there's always some kind of dust flying around. It seems to kick it up pretty bad. Lying down doesn’t make it worse, but it feels worse when I'm trying to sleep, you know? 'Cause I'm just layin' there coughin'.
DOCTOR: Right, so cold air and dust seem to be triggers. And it's more noticeable at night because you're lying flat. Have you had a fever, chills, or any shortness of breath with this cough?
PATIENT: No fever, no. Not that I've checked, anyway. I don't really bother with thermometers. No chills either. And...no, I can breathe alright. It's not like I'm wheezing or nothin'. It’s just… a constant cough, and it makes me feel worn out. It's mostly a wet cough, too. Lots of…stuff coming up. Sorry to be graphic.
DOCTOR: No, no apology needed. That's helpful information. A wet cough with sputum production. What color is the sputum, generally?
PATIENT: Ugh... mostly it’s clear, or kinda white. But sometimes, especially when it’s real bad, it gets…yellowish. Not bright yellow, more like…old straw colored, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And have you noticed any chest pain with the cough, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No chest pain. None at all. And… no swelling either. My feet get a little tired after work, but that’s just from standin’ all day, I figure. I haven’t noticed any swelling swelling. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain or swelling. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or lung disease?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' serious. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills a few years back. I haven’t been to a doctor much, honestly. Just when somethin' really hurts. I mostly try to tough things out.
DOCTOR: Alright, managed hypertension. Do you know what medication you were on for that, if you remember?
PATIENT: Let me think...I think it was something with an 'A' in it? Amlodipine, maybe? Or somethin’ close to that. I stopped takin’ it a while back, though, doctor said my numbers were lookin’ good enough to try without it. Been okay since, 'til this cough started, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine previously for hypertension, currently off medication. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything put in front of me. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Just coffee, to get me through the day. And water, when I remember. I don’t really bother with vitamins or nothin’ like that. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit. My dad smoked, though. He died young, lung cancer. That kinda scared me off it.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I have a beer with supper sometimes. Maybe three, four times a week. Nothin' crazy, just to relax. I don’t drink hard liquor, and I don’t go out drinkin’ with the boys or anything. Just a beer with my meal, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional beer consumption. Now, let’s talk about your work. You mentioned working in a plant. What kind of work do you do there, and are you exposed to any specific dusts or chemicals?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's a food processing plant. Mostly I'm sortin' and packin' the beans. Lots of dust from the beans themselves, I guess. And sometimes there's a smell, kinda chemical-ish when they’re cleanin' the equipment, but I don’t know what it is. We get masks sometimes, but they don’t always fit right, and I forget to wear 'em half the time. It's not the best job, but it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, sorting and packing beans at a food processing plant with exposure to bean dust and occasional chemical smells. You mentioned the masks don’t always fit well. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up and I’ll listen to your lungs?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. stands up slowly Be careful, I'm a little unsteady on my feet. Go ahead. leans slightly forward, trying to relax
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Alright. I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, and some crackles as well. Your breathing sounds a bit labored. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Now, could you open your mouth?
PATIENT: Ugh… wheezing? That doesn’t sound good. opens mouth Alright, here. Not much to see, just a regular mouth. tries to smile weakly I guess that’s what you're lookin' for, right? Just tell me if somethin’s wrong. I don’t want this draggin' on all winter.
DOCTOR: Okay, throat looks normal, no obvious signs of infection. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Now, let's check your oxygen saturation and temperature. Your oxygen saturation is 93%, which is a little low. And your temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit. Given your symptoms, wheezing, crackles in your lungs, lower oxygen saturation, and history of cough and fatigue, I’m concerned about a possible lower respiratory infection, potentially bronchitis or even some early signs of pneumonia. We need to get a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia. Also, I want to do a sputum sample to identify what's causing the infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Pneumonia? That sounds serious. fidgets slightly X-ray and a…sputum sample? I guess so. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Can I still go to work, though? I need the money. But I don’t want to get anyone else sick, if I got somethin’ bad. Tell me what I need to do. And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, it's good you're thinking of others. We'll get this figured out. You should stay home from work until we get the X-ray results back, to avoid potentially spreading anything. The lab technician will guide you on how to properly collect the sputum sample. It’s best to do it first thing in the morning. As for the X-ray, we can get that done right here in the clinic after this, and the results usually come back within a couple of hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. And I recommend you start taking over-the-counter guaifenesin, an expectorant, to help loosen up the mucus in your lungs. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Albuterol inhaler…guaifenesin...okay. I can try. rubs his forehead So, no work 'til you call. Inhaler, pills…and no coughin’ on people. Sounds about right. Just tell me how to take these things, and what to watch out for. I'm a pretty simple guy, Doctor. I don’t want any surprises. And…thank you. I appreciate you lookin’ into this. I was startin' to think I was just gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You're not just getting old, it's good we're investigating this. Here's a printout with detailed instructions for both the albuterol inhaler and the guaifenesin. For the inhaler, you'll want to take two puffs every four to six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. It's important to rinse your mouth out with water after each use to prevent thrush. The guaifenesin, you can take 600 milligrams every four hours as needed. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids while taking it. As for things to watch out for, if you experience any severe shortness of breath, chest pain, fever over 101 Fahrenheit, or if your cough gets significantly worse, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Ugh...rinse my mouth? That's a lot to remember. Okay, two puffs every four to six hours, rinse mouth. Guaifenesin with water. No fever over 101. Shortness of breath, chest pain...go to the hospital. pauses, thinking I think I got it. Is there anything else I should be doin'? Like, special foods or somethin’? Or…anything I should avoid? I don’t want to mess this up. And…can I still have my beer? Is that okay? looks at Dr. Voytek with a hopeful expression
DOCTOR: That's a good question! No special foods or anything like that. Just focus on staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. As for things to avoid, try to limit your exposure to dust and smoke as much as possible, especially during this recovery. And regarding your beer, it's probably best to limit your alcohol consumption until we know what’s causing your symptoms. Alcohol can sometimes interact with medications and can also weaken your immune system. Just one beer a day, if you really want one. And make sure to eat something with it, okay?
PATIENT: Alright, one beer, with food. Noted. chuckles softly Sounds like a sensible plan. Hydrate, rest, limit dust, one beer. I can do that. I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been a real help. I’ll go get the X-ray, and I'll wait for your call. Thank you again. stands up slowly, a little steadier this time I appreciate your patience with an old man like me. gives a small nod and turns to leave Hopefully, this gets sorted out quick.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pithan. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. And you're not an "old man" – you're just taking care of yourself. Take it easy, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
