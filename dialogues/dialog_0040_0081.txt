DOCTOR: Right. Jailia Chakka. Eighteen years old. Look, I've got a waiting room full of actual patients, so let’s just get to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's quite simple, really. I am experiencing a rather...unfortunate decline in my physical condition. I’ve been losing weight, despite maintaining a perfectly reasonable diet, and I’m perpetually fatigued. Furthermore, I’ve been suffering from excessive night sweats, which is…unbecoming, to say the least.
DOCTOR: "Unfortunate decline," is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's rather… distressing. One expects a certain level of physical well-being at my age. It's simply not acceptable to feel… diminished. And frankly, it's impacting my work. A graphic designer needs a certain… vibrancy.
DOCTOR: Right, vibrancy. Look, everyone feels tired sometimes. You're eighteen, probably staying up too late on… whatever it is eighteen-year-olds do. Let’s not make a mountain out of a molehill. When did this… “diminishment” start, precisely?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you my lifestyle is perfectly regulated. I maintain a consistent schedule. As for when it began… approximately three months ago, I would say. It was subtle at first, a slight decrease in energy. But it has been progressively worsening. It’s not simply ‘feeling tired,’ Doctor. It's… a genuine weakening. I can recall the exact date, actually; it was May 2nd, after a particularly demanding freelance project. I was finishing a logo design for a new tea company.
DOCTOR: May 2nd… tea company… hmm. Alright, let’s see what the records say… Okay, height 196…weight 105?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. 196 centimetres. It’s… a considerable height. One doesn't simply forget one’s height. And yes, my weight is 105 kilograms. Are you… questioning my numbers, Doctor? I assure you, I am perfectly aware of my own physical attributes.
DOCTOR: Don’t get snippy with me, young lady. It’s just… a rather unusual ratio, that’s all. Have you had any fevers, chills, night sweats – you mentioned night sweats, but how frequent?
PATIENT: "Snippy"? I simply find it… unsettling when a medical professional doubts information I provide. As for the night sweats… they are becoming quite regular, Doctor. Almost every night now, I wake up drenched. It's… extremely inconvenient. And no, I haven't had a fever, per se, but I often feel… warm. A sort of internal heat, even when the room is cool. It's rather distressing, really. It disrupts my sleep, of course, and then affects my concentration. One can’t produce quality work when one is constantly exhausted and… clammy.
DOCTOR: Internal heat… right. Any… unusual bowel movements?
PATIENT: Doctor, I fail to see how my… bowel movements are relevant to my fatigue and weight loss. Really, I find that question rather… intrusive. However, if you must know, they are… normal. Perfectly normal. I maintain a very regimented diet, as I've mentioned. This is becoming quite unproductive, Doctor. I am attempting to convey a serious medical concern, and you are asking about… bodily functions.
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve been doing this for twenty-five years. You tell me everything, then I can figure out what's wrong. It's called a medical history. Alright, any cough?
PATIENT: Very well. If you insist on this… exhaustive interrogation. No, I do not have a cough. I assure you, my respiratory system is functioning perfectly adequately. I practice mindful breathing exercises, you see. It's essential for maintaining focus during long design projects. One must be able to control one’s bodily functions, Doctor. It’s a matter of discipline. Honestly, I fail to see how any of this… minutiae will assist you in diagnosing my condition. This is wasting both of our time.
DOCTOR: Right. No cough. Any changes in appetite?
PATIENT: Actually, yes. That is something I haven’t mentioned. My appetite…has lessened somewhat. Not drastically, but I find myself less inclined to eat. The thought of food doesn’t… appeal as much. It’s quite perplexing, really. One expects a healthy appetite, especially given the demands of my profession. I require energy to create, Doctor. It’s a fundamental requirement. It started around the same time as the fatigue, approximately three months ago. And no, it isn't because of any emotional distress. My life is perfectly stable, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, decreased appetite... Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: My family history is…quite unremarkable, Doctor. No history of chronic illness, no significant ailments, certainly nothing resembling my current condition. My mother is perfectly healthy, runs a small tailoring business, very robust. My father is a retired engineer, equally healthy. We are Nepalese, you see, and generally known for our…sturdiness. It’s quite baffling, really. This is a rather…isolated incident. No one in my family has ever experienced such… debilitation. I assure you. It's… concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's just do a quick physical exam. Lie down on the table. I need to listen to your lungs and feel your abdomen. Don't make a fuss.
PATIENT: "Don't make a fuss"? Doctor, I find that tone rather… condescending. However, if a physical examination is absolutely necessary, I suppose I can comply. But I trust you will be… thorough and respectful. Please proceed. But do be gentle.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound…clear. A little fast breathing, but nothing alarming. Abdomen…soft. Not tender. A little…thin, but nothing remarkable. Pulse is elevated. Blood pressure is…normal. Everything seems okay. Have you been…stressed lately?
PATIENT: "Seems okay"? Doctor, I am experiencing significant physical distress, and you dismiss it with "seems okay"? I assure you, my condition is far from acceptable. And yes, I suppose one could argue that dealing with a dismissive medical professional is somewhat stressful. But that is hardly the root of my problem. This examination has been… utterly unproductive. I am losing weight, experiencing debilitating fatigue, and suffering from excessive night sweats, and all you can tell me is that I "seem okay"? This is… frankly, unacceptable. I was hoping for a diagnosis, perhaps some sort of treatment plan, not… vague assurances and patronizing questions. I fail to see what this consultation has accomplished.
