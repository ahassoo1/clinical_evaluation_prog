DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, travel, yeah. Need… stuff for travel. My wife, she always… she took care of this. Now I have to do it. It's… far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, travel vaccinations, got it. And where are you travelling to, Odell?
PATIENT: Somewhere hot. Very hot. Lots of… sand? I don't… she booked it. Nepal to… other place. Not America. Not Europe. Just… hot. Does it matter? I just need the… shots.
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, Odell, as different regions require different vaccinations and precautions. Do you happen to know the country, or even a city?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, okay. She wrote it down… somewhere. Hold on. … Here. Dubai. Yeah, Dubai. Is that… important? It sounds expensive.
DOCTOR: Dubai. Okay, that's helpful. Yes, that is important. It helps me determine which vaccinations and preventative medications you might need. Now, just to get a better understanding, how long will you be travelling for?
PATIENT: Two weeks. She wanted a… break. Two weeks. Is that long enough to get sick? She always said to be careful with… the water. I don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Two weeks. Okay. And you're concerned about getting sick, especially with the water. That's good awareness. Before we discuss specific vaccinations, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Recent? Uh… no. Not that I remember. She took me to the doctor. Years ago. For… everything. I just… followed her. I don't keep track of these things. Is this important? I feel… dizzy a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent vaccinations. We'll need to consider you potentially needing some updates then. And you mentioned feeling a little dizzy – is that new, or have you been feeling that way for a while?
PATIENT: Just now. Maybe the heat in here? It's... stuffy. I don't usually get dizzy. She always said I have… good blood pressure. But she was always checking things. I don't know what good blood pressure is. It just sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's check your blood pressure just to be sure. And we can rule out anything immediate causing the dizziness. It’s a quick and painless check. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. No. Not that I know of. She gave me pills for… sleeping. And something for my… stomach. But no allergies. Never had a reaction. Are you sure you need to know all this? It feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Just making sure we have a complete picture, Odell. And it is a lot, I understand. It's always best to be thorough, especially with travel medicine. Now, have you had any significant medical conditions in the past – anything major you’ve been treated for?
PATIENT: Major…? Not really. I broke my arm once, when I was little. Climbing a tree. She was very mad. And… she said my heart was strong. That's about it. I'm a strong man. I work with… metal. Big metal. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, just a broken arm as a child and a strong heart – good to know! Working with metal is good, but doesn't directly affect the travel vaccines. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… the sleeping pills. Sometimes. When I can't… you know. And… a little something for my stomach. When I eat bad food. But not all the time. She got them for me. From the… shop. Do you need the names? They're in Nepali. You probably won’t understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sleeping pills and something for your stomach, both prescribed by your wife. Knowing the names would be helpful, even if they are in Nepali, we can try to identify them. But for now, let’s focus on your travel plans. Have you travelled internationally before?
PATIENT: Just… with her. Everywhere. America, Europe, some places in Asia. She liked to explore. I just… went with her. I don't remember the names of the places. Too many places. I just followed her. It’s different going by myself. Much different. Is Dubai safe? She always picked safe places.
DOCTOR: Dubai is generally considered a very safe destination, Odell. So that's good. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I’ll check your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, please. I don’t like doctors. Too many… poking and prodding. She always said I was a strong man, very healthy. But she isn’t here now. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, temperature is normal. Pulse is a little elevated, but likely from being in a new environment and some anxiety. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, but not critically high. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. Everything seems okay so far, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something to keep an eye on. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, flu, or stomach upset?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… I've been trying to take care of myself. She always… she always made sure I was healthy. I had a little stomach trouble last week, maybe? Something I ate. But it passed. It's probably nothing. Just… feeling a little weak, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, some recent mild stomach upset that has resolved, and a feeling of being a little weak now. That's good information. One last question before we discuss vaccinations. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight…? Hmm. Maybe a little. I haven’t been eating as well. She always made sure I had… good food. Now I just… eat whatever. Not much appetite, to be honest. I’ve lost some weight, probably. Is that bad? She would be mad if she knew.
DOCTOR: Okay, some recent weight loss and decreased appetite. That’s something we’ll want to address. Based on what you’ve told me, Odell, and the slightly elevated blood pressure and recent weight loss, I recommend we hold off on giving vaccinations today until we get some basic blood work done to check your overall health and rule out anything concerning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work…? More poking and prodding? Ugh. I just want to go to Dubai. She booked everything. Is it… necessary? I just want to get this over with. I miss her. I just want to go. But... if you say so. But make it quick. And no needles if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand you're frustrated, Odell. And I’m very sorry for your loss. It is necessary to ensure your health before travelling, and to determine if any preventative measures are needed. The blood work is a simple procedure – just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. It will give us a much clearer picture of your health and help us make the best decisions for your trip. We'll need to check your basic blood counts, kidney function, and liver function. It won't take long, and it’s better to be safe. Shall we proceed with the blood work then?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. And explain everything. I don't understand… blood counts. Or kidneys. Or livers. Just… explain it so I can understand. I don't want any surprises. And no needles if possible. Seriously. It makes me… nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. We'll get this done quickly. As for the blood work, think of your blood as a river flowing through your body. The blood cells are like little boats carrying oxygen and nutrients. The "blood count" just tells us how many of each type of boat we have – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Your kidneys are like filters, cleaning the river. The test checks how well they're working. And your liver is like a processing plant, breaking down things in the river. The test checks how well it’s working. It's all just a way of making sure your internal systems are running smoothly before you travel. And yes, it does involve a needle, unfortunately. But it’s a small needle, and it’s very quick. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But… be quick. And… don’t talk to me while you’re doing it. Just… do it. Please. This is… hard. I miss her so much. She always made things easier.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Just relax your arm. I'll be very quick. And I will be quiet. Okay, all done. Just keep that bandage on for about 15 minutes. I’ll send this sample to the lab, and we should have results back within a few days. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for some antidiarrheal medication, just in case, and a list of foods to avoid while travelling. We will review the lab results and discuss vaccinations at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Okay. Antidiarrheal… good. I don’t want to be… sick. And a list of foods… good. Less to worry about. A follow-up… okay. A few days… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I just… I just want to go to Dubai. To… remember her. Thank you. I think. Is there anything else? Please, no more poking.
DOCTOR: No more poking, I promise. That’s all for today, Odell. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for August 8th at 10:00 AM. The lab results will be ready by then. Here's the prescription for the antidiarrheal medication, and this pamphlet lists foods to avoid while traveling in regions with a high risk of traveler's diarrhea. It also has some helpful tips for staying hydrated and avoiding other common travel illnesses. If you experience any unusual symptoms before your appointment – such as high fever, severe diarrhea, or dehydration – please contact the clinic immediately. Take care of yourself, Odell. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: Okay. August 8th. I’ll… remember that. Thank you. For everything. I… I just want to go to Dubai. To… to be with her memory. Bye.
