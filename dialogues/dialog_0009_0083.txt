DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor...Petri-moolx, is it? Yes. Well, it's... a little thing, really. I just... I thought it would be nice. A card. You know, a "get well" card. Or, encouragement. Something like that. My ex-wife, she always sent cards. It was… thoughtful. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It’s Petrimoulx, and yes, Medicare is good to know, thank you. So, if I understand correctly, you're coming in today because you'd like to receive a card – a get-well or encouragement card?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A card from you. It's... a little boost. I don't... I don't feel sick, exactly. Just… low spirits, maybe? It’s important to have these things, you know? Shows people care. It's not like I'm asking for a prescription or anything. Just a card. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kammer, it’s not unusual at all to want a little encouragement, and I appreciate you being so open with me about what you need. It's very important to me that my patients feel supported, and if a card would be helpful, I’m happy to do that. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me a bit more about what's been bringing your spirits down?
PATIENT: Well... it's a long story. My ex-wife... she always had a way with words. Made everything seem brighter. Now, things are just… plain. And the kids... they don’t call much anymore. It's just… the little things. Being alone, mostly. I work, you know. Stationary engineer. Boilers. It's a lonely job. Not much talking. It's not like I’m complaining. A man gets used to it. But… a card would be nice. It shows someone remembers you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you’re going through a difficult time, and it’s completely understandable to feel down when you’re facing loneliness and changes in your relationships. It takes courage to talk about these things. To get a better picture of your overall health, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Well… I guess. I don't get sick much. Strong constitution, you know. Puerto Rican blood. I had… a bad knee once, working on a boiler. Had to see a doctor then. But that was years ago. No… no big problems. I don't take any pills. Never been much for that sort of thing. I eat… okay. Mostly sandwiches. And coffee. Lots of coffee. Is that what you need to know? Because if you're asking about why I want a card, it's not because I'm sick. It’s just… nice.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kammer. I understand you're not coming in because of an illness, and I appreciate you clarifying that. I'm just gathering some basic information as part of a standard check-in. You mentioned a bad knee years ago. Was that treated with surgery or physical therapy?
PATIENT: No surgery. Just… physical therapy. Lots of stretching. And ice. It still bothers me sometimes, when it’s cold. But I can manage. I worked through it, mostly. A man's got to work, you know? Can't sit around feeling sorry for himself. It’s just… a little ache. Nothing to worry about. Really. Now, about that card… are you going to write something nice in it? It's important to have a personal touch. My ex-wife always knew what to say.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I will. I’m happy to personalize it, Mr. Kammer. I will definitely write something thoughtful. Before we move on, could you tell me if you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes, during the spring. But that’s just dust, probably. I eat everything. Puerto Rican food, you know? Lots of spices. Garlic, onions, peppers... everything. I'm a pretty robust fella. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure you need all these questions just for a card? It feels… a little much. I just want a nice card to brighten my day. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Mr. Kammer. I apologize if my questions seem excessive for what you’re seeking. I sometimes get carried away with being thorough. It’s a habit, and I want to ensure I’m providing the best possible care, even for something as simple as a card. Let’s put the medical history aside for now. You mentioned feeling low spirits due to loneliness and changes in your relationships. Would you be open to discussing that a little more?
PATIENT: Discuss… it? What’s there to discuss? My ex-wife is gone, the kids are busy... I work alone. It is what it is. I don’t complain. A man doesn't wallow. But… it’s just… quiet. Too quiet. I miss… someone to talk to. Someone to share a coffee with. That’s all. But that’s not something you fix with… questions. It's a feeling. A loneliness. And a card… a card would just be a little something to remind me that someone… remembers. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you listening, but maybe… maybe we should just focus on the card?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. I apologize for pressing further when it's clearly not what you're seeking. It's my tendency to try and understand everything, and I realize now that sometimes, just acknowledging how someone feels is enough. Let’s absolutely focus on the card. I will write something thoughtful and personal, and I hope it brightens your day. Would you like me to write anything specific, or is there a particular message you'd like me to convey?
PATIENT: Just… something nice. Something about… remembering. About how… nice it is to be remembered. And… maybe something about… a good, strong cup of coffee. That would be good. That would be very good. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for understanding. It’s… it’s a little thing, but it means a lot. Really. Now… when can I expect the card?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. “Remembering” and a “good, strong cup of coffee” – perfect. I will write something along those lines, and I promise to get it to you as soon as possible. My nurse will bring it around tomorrow. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s all. Just the card. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… kind. It's not easy talking about these things, you know? But you made it… easier. Thank you. I should get going now. Have a good day, Doctor. And… thank you again for the card. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You have a wonderful day as well, Mr. Kammer. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything. .
