DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It's… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I just feel… down. More than usual, you understand. And I thought it best to get it checked. I haven't much time, if you don't mind a quick conversation.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani, we’ll go at your pace. It’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to explain – that's what I'm here for. And don’t worry about the time; we’ll make the most of it. When you say “down,” can you tell me a little more about what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… a heaviness, really. Like a weight on my chest. Not physically, you understand. Just… emotionally draining. I don't enjoy the things I used to. Even getting up in the mornings is a struggle. And I sleep… too much, perhaps? Though when I am awake, I'm restless. It's a peculiar thing. Does that make any sense? I’ve been a lifeguard and ski patrol for… well, a long time. I'm usually quite robust, you see. This is new.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Nani. It sounds incredibly frustrating to feel this way, especially given how active you usually are. It’s good you’re recognizing this is a change for you. So, this feeling of heaviness, the loss of enjoyment, and trouble with sleep… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps… three months now? It started gradually, I think. Just a little less enthusiasm for my work, a little more… solitude. But it's gotten progressively worse, particularly in the last month. It's interfering with… everything, really. And my daughter, bless her heart, she noticed. She suggested I come see someone. I usually pride myself on handling things myself, you see. But… I suppose even robust people need a check-up sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's very true, Nani. It takes strength to recognize when you need support, and I commend you for coming in. Three months is a good timeframe to work with. Now, has anything specific happened in the last three months that might have triggered this change?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I can readily recall. My divorce was… finalized about a year ago. That was difficult, naturally. But I thought I'd adjusted. It was amicable, you understand. No animosity. He simply… wanted a different life. And I respect that. It's probably not that, then. Nothing major, certainly. Just… life, I suppose. A series of small disappointments, perhaps. Nothing worth mentioning, really. I'm usually quite resilient, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Nani. Even seemingly small things can accumulate and affect us. It's good to consider everything. Now, let's talk a bit more about how this is affecting your daily life. You mentioned trouble sleeping and a loss of enjoyment. Are you experiencing any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… yes, actually. It's… diminished. I used to enjoy cooking, Nigerian food especially, you understand. Very flavorful! But now… I find myself skipping meals. Not intentionally, mind you. I simply don't have the… the energy for it. And when I do eat, it's… bland things. Nothing with much taste. Which is quite unusual for me. I also find I’m less social. I used to meet friends for tea, but I've been… declining invitations. I just don’t feel up to it. It’s a bit of a downward spiral, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a clearer picture. Diminished appetite, loss of enjoyment in food, and withdrawing socially… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your physical health, just to rule out anything medical that could be contributing to these feelings. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A little. I haven’t weighed myself precisely, but my clothes… they feel a bit looser. Not alarmingly so, mind you. Just… noticeable. I suppose it’s not surprising, given the diminished appetite. And the… lack of activity. I usually swim several times a week, you see. But I haven’t felt up to it lately. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, isn’t it? I feel tired, so I don't exercise, and then I feel even more tired. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani, and that's absolutely what we're aiming for. It sounds like you're describing a pattern of symptoms that's impacting your quality of life. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a commitment this afternoon, you see. But please, do what you need to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this. I pride myself on being a strong woman, but this… this is wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nani. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Neurologically, everything appears intact. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Which is good. That helps us narrow down the possibilities.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, I suppose. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… just stress, then? I’ve always been quite stoic, you see. Perhaps I’ve simply ignored things for too long. Honestly, I haven't had much time for myself, not for many years. Work, then the divorce, then… life. I suppose I should have come sooner. I just didn’t want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're here now, Nani. And it’s certainly possible that accumulated stress is a significant factor. However, given the length of time you’ve been experiencing these symptoms—three months—and the specific combination of loss of enjoyment, diminished appetite, and withdrawal from social activities, it's important to consider other possibilities as well. I’m thinking we should do some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms. It’s a routine precaution, just to be thorough. And it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help determine the cause, then yes, please do. I suppose I should have come sooner, you’re right. I’m usually quite proactive about my health, but… this feels different. Frankly, Doctor, I'm a bit frightened. I've always been so… capable. To feel this way… it’s unsettling. I just want to feel like myself again. And quickly, if possible. I have a life to live, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Nani, and it's perfectly valid. It's unsettling to feel out of control, especially when you're accustomed to being capable and independent. But remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Okay, I'll order the blood work now. It will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. The lab results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I also want to ask you a few questions about your mood. Have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… sometimes. A sense of… emptiness, perhaps. But self-harm? No. Absolutely not. I’ve never even considered such a thing. I may feel tired, and a little… lost, but I’m a strong woman, Doctor. I wouldn’t do that. I have too much to live for, even if I don’t feel like it at the moment. I simply want to feel… normal again. I’m not sure what’s happening to me, frankly. I just hope it’s something that can be fixed. This isn't like me, you see. I pride myself on my resilience.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Nani. Thank you for being so honest with me. It’s important to rule out all possibilities, and I appreciate you sharing your feelings. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial physical exam, I’m leaning towards a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, but we need the blood work to rule out any other medical contributions. It’s common for people experiencing major life changes or accumulated stress to develop symptoms of depression, and it's a very treatable condition. Once we have the blood work results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Therapy… yes, perhaps. I’ve always been a bit skeptical of it, frankly. But if it will help… I suppose I’m willing to try. Medication… I’m less sure about that. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. But I understand you’re the doctor, and I trust your judgment. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this to be over. I have a life to live, and I’m tired of feeling this way. I’ve been strong for so long, and now… now I feel weak and lost. If therapy and medication will help me feel like myself again, then yes, I’m willing to try. But please, let’s keep it as… minimal as possible, if you understand. I don’t want to be reliant on anything long-term. This isn’t me, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Nani. We will absolutely approach this with a conservative approach, focusing on the least invasive options first. We can start with therapy and see how you respond. If that isn't sufficient, we can discuss medication options, and I promise we’ll choose the one with the fewest side effects and the lowest effective dose. I'm going to write you a referral to a therapist specializing in depression, Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent, and I’ve had very good feedback from other patients. I’ll also give you some information about coping strategies for depression that you can start using immediately. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or have any thoughts of harming yourself, please don't hesitate to contact me or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. And your understanding. This hasn’t been easy, frankly. To admit that I need help… it’s not something I’m accustomed to. I suppose I should schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma. And await the blood work results. Thank you, Doctor Maskal. I hope this works. I really do. I have a life to live, you see. And I’d like to start living it again. I believe that's all.
