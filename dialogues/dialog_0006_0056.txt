DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, good to see you. Or, well, good to meet you, actually. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Dr. Gorga, is it? A…Romanian, you said? Well, never mind that. I suppose I’m here about…the library. It’s become quite dreadful, you understand. Simply dreadful. Young people these days…no respect for Dewey, none at all. It's causing…a bit of strain. I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right…the library. Okay. And this…strain…is physical, or…?
PATIENT: Physical? Good heavens, no. Not physical. Though, my back does ache a bit from straightening these…these disorderly shelves. No, it’s…mental. A constant…irritation. It’s exhausting dealing with incompetence. Honestly, it feels like I’m the only one who cares about proper cataloging anymore. It’s quite…depleting, really.
DOCTOR: Depleting…so, you're feeling…stressed, overwhelmed?
PATIENT: Stressed? Is that what you call it now? Such…simplification. It’s a profound…disappointment, that’s what it is. To see the standards of academia lowered to such depths…it’s disheartening. Yes, alright, perhaps “stressed” is one way to put it. But it's more than that. Much more. Honestly, I haven’t the energy to explain it to someone who probably hasn’t even used a card catalog.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Well, we can explore this. Just trying to get a sense of things. Have you…noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, I sleep, of course. One must sleep. Though it's not as…restful as it used to be. I find myself…ruminating. Thinking about the chaos at the library, the incorrect classifications, the…the state of modern scholarship. It keeps me up. Not every night, mind you. But enough to be…inconvenient. Is this going somewhere? I have a luncheon reservation.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the sleep, are you finding yourself…more irritable than usual?
PATIENT: Irritable? My dear doctor, I’m a professor! Dealing with students and…and the general public is inherently irritating. It’s a professional hazard. The question is ridiculous. More so than usual? Perhaps. Though I always maintain a certain…decorum. I simply have less patience for foolishness. Honestly, it’s a constant battle against…mediocrity. It's terribly draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Honestly, doctor, are you implying something? I eat perfectly well. Though, admittedly, I find myself less…enthusiastic about meals lately. The thought of enjoying a proper dinner while knowing my library is descending into anarchy…it’s simply…unappetizing. It’s a matter of principle, you see. One must maintain standards, even in the face of…everything. Now, if you’ll excuse me…is this going to take much longer? My soufflé will collapse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just cover a few more things, then. Have you been feeling…down, or hopeless, lately?
PATIENT: Hopeless? Good heavens, no! I am a scholar! I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of knowledge! Though…...it is disheartening to see the younger generation so…disinterested. So focused on…frivolity. It makes one question the value of it all, perhaps. But hopeless? Absolutely not. Simply…disappointed. Deeply, profoundly disappointed. Now, are we finished? I really must be going. This is quite a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress and disappointment. Based on what you've told me, it seems like we're likely dealing with… adjustment disorder, possibly with elements of anxiety. I’m going to recommend a brief course of talk therapy. It would be a safe space to explore these feelings and develop some coping mechanisms. Would you be open to me providing you with a referral to a therapist in the area?
