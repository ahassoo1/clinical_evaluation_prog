DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks. They ain’t working so good no more. It's hard to… push it out, you know? Like a stuck coconut.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re having difficulty with urination. That’s a common issue, especially as we get older. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start? That's a good question. Not sure exactly. Maybe… a few weeks? Feels like a long time now. Everything gets blurry, you know? I just know it's harder now than it used to be. I gotta… push and strain. It’s not comfortable. My husband, he notices too. He says I take a long time in the bathroom.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, okay. And you said you have to strain to urinate, and it's uncomfortable. Is it painful, or just… difficult and straining?
PATIENT: Not really painful, no. More like… a lot of effort. Like trying to lift something heavy, but down there. And it don't come out all at once, sometimes. It stops and starts. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Stopping and starting, and needing to strain. Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder when you go, or does it feel like some is left behind?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question… I think… sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Hard to tell, really. I try to go again, just to be sure. But then it’s really hard to get anything out. It's frustrating. I just want it to work normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me think… Hmmm. Not really. I get up at night sometimes, to go. More than I used to, maybe. But old age, right? That's what my husband says. He says everything starts to sag and leak when you get old. It's not very polite to talk about it, is it?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to talk about it, Ms. Stoffregen. It's my job to listen. Getting up more often at night – how many times would you say that is?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe two or three times? Sometimes just once. It's not every night, you understand. Some nights are fine. But it interrupts my sleep, that's for sure. I used to sleep right through, like a log. Now I’m always waking up.
DOCTOR: Okay, two or three times a night. And you’re interrupting your sleep. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain with this?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot or anything. Chills…no. And my back… well, my back always aches a little. Old age again, you know? It's just a general ache, not anything sharp or new. It's always been a bit creaky.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Medications…? Let me see…Oh, just the one for my blood pressure. Small white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But not every day. My doctor gave it to me, Dr. Lewis. I think that's it. Nothing else that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and something for arthritis as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband always jokes I'll eat anything that doesn't eat me first. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I think. It's hard to remember things like that now. Never been one for fancy foods anyway. Just a simple Tongan girl, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Ms. Stoffregen, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh my. Serious illnesses… Let me see. I had pneumonia when I was young. A bad one. Stayed in the hospital for a week. And… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… hmm… That’s all I can really remember. Everything gets a bit mixed up, you know? I had a family, children, but their names… sometimes they don't come to me so easy. It's terrible, really. It's like a fog.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Don’t worry about remembering everything. Pneumonia and gallbladder removal. Do you know when you had those procedures?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was… a very long time ago. The pneumonia, when I was a young woman. Maybe… forty, fifty years ago? And the gallbladder… even longer. Probably closer to sixty years ago. Things were very different back then, you know? The doctors didn't explain things like they do now. It feels like a lifetime ago. It's all blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, I had a good many. My husband, of course. He’s… getting on in years. And my children… five of them. All grown up now, with families of their own. But their names… It’s awful, I know. I should remember their names. My daughter, she visits sometimes. The one with… the curly hair. But I can't recall her name right now. It’s just… gone. It comes and goes, you know? Like the tide.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you may be experiencing some memory loss, and that's not uncommon at your age. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things. We can talk about that later if you'd like. For now, let's focus on your waterworks. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and checking a few things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Yes, alright. If you think it will help. It's just… all this talking is tiring. But do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please. My old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be very gentle. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Just relax and breathe normally. And I'm just going to feel your abdomen… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… a little bit sore, maybe. But that's just my old age. It aches all over, you know? Like a dull ache. Not sharp or anything. Is everything alright, Doctor? You look very serious.
DOCTOR: Everything seems okay so far, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m going to listen to your back now. Just breathe deeply. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No pain…just… a little discomfort, maybe. Like a tight muscle. I have been doing a lot of gardening. My husband says I overdo it. I just love being out there, with the flowers. It makes me feel… alive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. The exam was normal, no significant tenderness or abnormalities. Given your symptoms – difficulty starting urination, straining, stopping and starting, feeling like you don’t completely empty your bladder, and getting up more often at night – it’s possible you have an enlarged prostate, or urinary retention. Now, men have a prostate gland that can enlarge with age. But women can also have issues with bladder emptying. We need to do some tests to figure out what’s going on. I want to order a urine test and a bladder scan to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. An enlarged… what now? And a scan? It all sounds very… complicated. But if it will help, Doctor, then alright. I trust your judgement. Just… explain things slowly, please? And don’t use too many big words. I don't understand all that medical talk. A urine test, I can do. And a scan… does it hurt?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I will explain everything slowly and simply. The prostate is a small gland men have. It can get bigger as we get older and press on the tube that carries urine out of the bladder. That can make it hard to start and stop urination. But women can also have issues emptying their bladder completely. The urine test is just a simple sample, and the bladder scan is a painless test where we use a machine to measure how much urine is left in your bladder after you go to the bathroom. It doesn't involve any needles or anything uncomfortable. We just use a device like a wand on your lower abdomen. Then we can see how much urine is remaining. It will help us figure out what's going on and the best way to help you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh. A wand? No needles… That’s good. Yes, I think I understand. It sounds… less scary now. So, it will tell you how much water is still in there? After I… try to go? Alright. Alright, let’s do it. When do we do the tests? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I need to get home to my husband. He worries when I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do the urine test right here in the examination room, and then the nurse, Maria, will perform the bladder scan. It should only take about fifteen minutes total, and then we can discuss the results. Let me write the orders, and I'll have Maria come in right away. Just a heads up, depending on the results, we may need to refer you to a urologist. They are specialists who deal with problems of the urinary system. But let's get these tests done first and see what they show. Maria will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: A… yourologist? Oh dear. Another doctor? Well… alright. Let’s just get the tests done first. I don't want to think about any more doctors right now. No… I think that’s all my questions. Just… please make sure Maria is gentle. My old bones are very sensitive. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll make sure Maria is very gentle. I’ll just go ahead and call her now. Maria?
