DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about my speech. It’s been… a bit off, lately. Hard to explain, really. I just… stumble over my words sometimes. It’s not constant, though. It just… happens. I don’t really recall when it started, precisely. It feels like it's been a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, "a bit off" and stumbling over words. And you said it’s not constant, it comes and goes. You don't recall a specific starting point… that's alright, we can try to narrow it down. Can you describe what "off" feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… like my tongue doesn't quite cooperate with my brain, if that makes sense? It’s not pain, not a numbness… just… a disconnect. Like the words are there, I know what I want to say, but they don’t come out right. Sometimes it’s just a slowness, other times it's like I’m trying to untangle something. Does that… explain it at all? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very helpful description, Adyn. "Disconnect" is good. Slowness and feeling like you're untangling things… okay. Has this been interfering with anything – school, talking to friends, work, anything like that?
PATIENT: Work, mostly. I’m a construction manager, so I have to be clear with instructions and things. It’s… embarrassing when I can’t get a sentence out properly when I’m trying to tell people what to do. It hasn’t caused any major problems, thankfully, but it’s definitely made things… a bit stressful. I try to just slow down, but it doesn’t always help. School… I'm not currently in school. And friends… I usually just see them casually, so it hasn’t been too noticeable, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, work is the main area of impact, needing clear communication as a construction manager. And it’s causing stress. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the speech difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but that could just be from work, honestly. I haven’t had any headaches or dizziness. No trouble with my vision, no weakness on one side of my body… I don’t think so, anyway. My husband might notice something I haven't, perhaps? He's usually pretty observant. It's difficult for me to recall anything specific. Is there something particular I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: That’s good you’ve been thinking about it, and that you haven't noticed any other major symptoms. It's helpful to know what isn’t happening, too. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your cranial nerves, your reflexes, and just generally get a feel for things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I’m… not a fan of doctors, if I’m honest, but I’m glad I came in. It's just… unsettling when things aren't working properly, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, if you could just sit up here for me. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, then we'll move on to the neurological exam. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay… reflexes are normal. Balance seems good. Coordination is also within normal limits. Cranial nerves… your eye movements are normal, your facial symmetry is good, and your swallowing seems normal. I’m not detecting any obvious weakness or asymmetry. Your speech is slightly slurred at times, but it’s not consistent. I'm noting some mild dysarthria. Have you experienced any recent injuries to your head or neck?
PATIENT: Dysarthria? I… don’t think I’ve heard that term before. No, I haven’t had any recent injuries to my head or neck. Not that I recall, anyway. I mean, I work on construction sites, so there's always a small chance of bumping my head, but nothing major. Definitely no serious trauma. I might have gotten a little dizzy once or twice, but that was usually just from being in the heat. Is dysarthria something serious?
DOCTOR: Dysarthria just means difficulty with speech articulation, often due to muscle weakness or nerve problems. It can be caused by a lot of things – some minor, some more serious. Given your work environment, a minor head injury is a possibility, even if you don't specifically recall a significant one. The dizziness could be related, or something else entirely. To rule things out, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a basic blood work panel to check for any underlying infections or vitamin deficiencies. And, I'd like to get an MRI of your brain, just to get a clear picture of everything and make sure there's no structural problem causing this. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds a bit… involved. But if it’s to get to the bottom of things, then yes, that sounds reasonable. Blood work is no problem at all. I just… I don't like being poked and prodded, if you understand. But I trust your judgement, Doctor. So, yes, let's do the tests. What do I need to do next? Do I need to schedule the MRI appointment myself?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It's not the most pleasant experience, but it gives us a lot of information. My nurse, Maria, will give you the lab requisition for the blood work. You can go to the lab across the street – they take our insurance. And yes, you'll need to schedule the MRI appointment yourself. I’ll give you a referral, and the number for the imaging center. They'll want to confirm your insurance details and schedule a time that works for you. They'll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the scan – usually, it just involves removing any metal jewelry and letting them know if you have any implants. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your speech gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, or severe headaches, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Blood work across the street, and schedule the MRI myself with the referral. And come back if things get worse. I'll make sure to write all of that down. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I feel a little less worried now, knowing we have a plan. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I'm glad I could ease some of your worry. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all. And please, take care of yourself. Maria will be in shortly with the paperwork.
