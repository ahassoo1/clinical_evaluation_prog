DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s Ricky, please. And well, my foot’s been botherin’ me. It’s really puffed up, like a balloon almost. Been that way for a couple days now, I think. Maybe three? I lose track sometimes. But yeah, it hurts to walk on it, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Ricky, right, sorry about that. Okay, foot’s puffed up for…a few days. Hurts to walk. Hmm. Can you tell me exactly where on your foot it's hurting the most?
PATIENT: Mostly right here, on the inside. <points to the arch of his left foot> It’s not like a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, but when I try to put weight on it…oof. And the swelling goes up into my ankle a bit. It’s the left one, by the way, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Left foot, inside of the arch, dull ache that worsens with weight-bearing, and swelling extending to the ankle. Okay. Have you done anything to try and help it?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been tryin’ to stay off of it, mostly. Didn’t do much good, to be honest. I tried wrappin’ it with an old towel, but that just felt…tight. Didn't seem to help help, ya know? And I iced it once, but it didn't really do nothin' either. It's just…still swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright. No real relief with rest, a towel wrap, or ice. Have you had any injuries to that foot recently?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Not that I remember. I was walkin’ in the garden a couple weeks ago, maybe? Stepped on somethin’ kinda funny, a rock or somethin’. Didn't think much of it at the time. It just felt like a little pinch. But that was before the swelling started, so probably nothin’. I do a lot of walkin’, though. Gotta get my steps in, ya know? <chuckles softly>
DOCTOR: Okay, walking in the garden, stepped on something, didn’t think much of it. Right. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. It's just the pain and the swelling. No fever, no chills, no nothin’ like that. And it hasn’t gotten worse worse, just…stayin’ about the same, maybe a little better when I sit with it up. It just feels wrong, ya know? Like it’s gonna give way if I put too much weight on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms, stable pain, feels unstable. Let’s take a quick look at your foot, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? It's kinda sensitive. <lifts his left leg slightly, wincing a little> I'm not much for bein' poked and prodded, but I appreciate you lookin’ at it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to feel around a bit, and check how well you can move your foot. <palpates the area gently> Hmm. Definitely some tenderness here, along the arch. And it is swollen. <gently moves the foot up and down, side to side> Ouch, right there?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s the spot. <winces> Right along the inside, kinda where my arch is. And when you bend it like that, yeah, that's not feelin' so good. Feels… stretched, I guess? Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s pulled. You think it's a bad sprain? I never had one before, but I hear they're awful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to palpation along the medial arch, discomfort with range of motion. It could be a sprain, but based on the location and how it feels, I’m thinking it could be a posterior tibial tendon issue. It's a tendon along the inside of your ankle that helps support your arch. <pauses, looking at the patient> We'd need an X-ray to rule out a fracture, just to be safe. And potentially further imaging if that comes back clear. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Imaging… X-ray… sounds kinda serious, don’t it? <fidgets with his hands> I don’t have insurance, Doc. Is that gonna be expensive? And what is a… a "posterior tibial tendon" anyway? You lose me with the fancy words. I just wanna be able to walk again, that's all. Is it somethin’ that’ll heal on its own?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ricky. It does sound serious, and I want to make sure we figure out what’s going on. An X-ray will help rule out a break in one of the bones, which is the most important thing. As for cost, I’ll have the office check on pricing and see if we can find a lower-cost facility. We can also discuss options if cost is a significant barrier. The posterior tibial tendon is a band of tissue that runs along the inside of your ankle and helps hold up your arch. When it gets inflamed or damaged, it can cause pain and the arch to fall. It doesn't always heal on its own, and without treatment, it can get worse over time. <pauses> Let's start with the X-ray. Then we can discuss a treatment plan based on the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: X-ray first, then talk about what comes next… alright. That sounds… sensible. I guess. <sighs> It's just… I got things to do, you know? Gotta get my steps in. But if it’s somethin’ serious, I guess I gotta do what I gotta do. So, yeah, let’s get the picture taken. Where do we go? And how long will it take? I don't wanna be here all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. The X-ray technician is just down the hall, in room three. It should only take a few minutes. Once they have the images, we'll review them together. I’ll ask one of the nurses to get a temporary boot to support your foot in the meantime. <pauses> Just try to avoid putting any weight on it as much as possible until we get the results. We'll take it one step at a time, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, room three, no weight… I can do that. A boot, huh? Never thought I’d be wearin’ a boot. <chuckles weakly> Well, thanks, Doc. I appreciate you explainin’ it all, and lookin’ after me. Hopefully it's nothin’ too bad. I'll go find room three. <starts slowly walking towards the indicated door, wincing with each step>
