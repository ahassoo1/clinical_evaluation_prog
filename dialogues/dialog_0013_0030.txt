DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Dr. Morenomartinez, it's nice to meet you too. Um, it's a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It's…different than usual, and not in a good way. I can’t really describe it, just that it's not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Kerriann. Changes in body odor can be a little concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. It's definitely something we can explore. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe… three weeks ago? Around July 10th, I think. I remember because my niece visited then, and I usually get a compliment on my perfume, but she didn’t say anything this time. And I realized, it wasn't the perfume, it was…me. I always use the same soap and deodorant, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around July 10th. And you haven’t changed anything about your hygiene routine – same soap, same deodorant?
PATIENT: That’s right. Dove soap, the sensitive skin one, and Secret deodorant, the powder fresh scent. I've used both for years. No change at all. I even double-checked to make sure I hadn’t accidentally picked up a different brand when I was at the store last time. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to rule that out. And is this odor constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, unfortunately. It's not like it disappears at any point. It's there all day, even after I shower. I’ve even started using extra deodorant, which I never used to do, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It's just… persistently different.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent and different, even with extra deodorant. Hmm. Are you noticing it anywhere specific – underarms, feet, all over?
PATIENT: Mostly under my arms, I think. But sometimes I feel like… it’s just all over, like a general smell. It's hard to pinpoint, really. My husband… well, my ex-husband used to always say I smelled nice, even after working all day. Now... I don't know if he'd say the same thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any other changes along with this, like sweating more or less than usual, any skin changes in your armpits, or even any fevers or weight loss?
PATIENT: Let me see... I haven't had a fever. And my weight is pretty stable, maybe even a little up, honestly. I've been comfort eating a bit since the divorce. As for sweating... I don't think so? Maybe a little more than usual in the heat, but that feels normal for August. But the skin… now that you mention it, it does feel a little rougher under my arms than it used to. Not a rash or anything, just… not as smooth.
DOCTOR: Okay, rougher skin under the arms, stable weight with some comfort eating, and no fever. That's helpful. And just to get a full picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let's see… I take a multivitamin, the Centrum Silver one, just the basic senior stuff. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it last year. Other than that, no. Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the Centrum Silver multivitamin. Good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe… twenty years ago? And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that, not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, really. I used to walk a lot, before my knees started acting up. Nothing major, thankfully. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise generally healthy. And any family history of anything significant – like unusual body odor, or certain types of cancers or skin conditions?
PATIENT: That's a good question… Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandmother had arthritis. I don't think anyone in my family has ever mentioned anything about… unusual body odor. It’s not something we really talked about, to be honest. No cancer that I know of, not recently anyway. My father’s side of the family, I don’t know much about, he passed away when I was young.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure in your mother, arthritis in your grandmother, and limited information about your father’s side. Okay. And just a couple more questions about your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, probably thirty years. Not a drinker. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty straightforward person, always have been. I drink a lot of tea, though. Herbal tea, mostly chamomile. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That definitely counts! Herbal tea is good. Okay, Kerriann, that gives me a really good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just a quick look at your skin, listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe check your lymph nodes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s just… unsettling. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just have a seat here, and I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then we'll take a look at your skin. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. I'm not hearing anything unusual. Your skin looks generally good, though I do notice some mild redness and a little bit of… slight thickening in your armpits, as you mentioned. No obvious rashes or lesions. I'm also going to gently palpate your lymph nodes under your arms and around your neck. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged, but not significantly so. They're tender to the touch, but not alarmingly so. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay… That sounds… complicated. Enlarged lymph nodes… that doesn’t sound good. What does that mean? Is it something serious? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Kerriann. Enlarged lymph nodes can be caused by a lot of things, and it doesn’t automatically mean something serious. They often swell in response to infection, even a minor one. However, because of the change in body odor and the mild thickening of the skin, along with the lymph node enlargement, I want to run a few tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection, and a metabolic panel to check your overall organ function. I’m also going to order a skin swab to rule out any bacterial or fungal infections. It’s a simple test – we just wipe the area with a cotton swab and send it to the lab. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood tests and a swab… okay. I can do that. Are they going to be expensive? I’m on Medicare, and I worry about the costs sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Kerriann. Fortunately, Medicare typically covers these tests, especially given your symptoms. We'll submit the claims for you, and you'll receive an Explanation of Benefits detailing any out-of-pocket costs. The lab will also be able to provide an estimate of your costs beforehand if you’d like. Okay, I'm ordering the CBC, metabolic panel, and skin swab now. The lab is just down the hall; I’ll have the nurse send you over shortly after we finish here. It should take about 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I’m going to recommend avoiding deodorant or any scented products in your armpits until we get the results back. This will help ensure the swab is accurate. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, no deodorant. Okay, I can do that. It's a little embarrassing, but I understand. No scented products. And then we wait for the results? How long will that take? Is it days, weeks…? I get anxious waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s frustrating waiting for results. Usually, we get those back within 2-3 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We're being proactive, and these tests will help us get to the bottom of this. While we wait, if you notice any new symptoms – fever, chills, significant pain or redness in your armpits, or any other concerns – please don’t hesitate to call us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes to take you to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… please call as soon as you have the results. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismiss it. It's nice to feel like someone is taking it seriously. Thank you, Dr. Morenomartinez.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help. We will get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be right with you, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. .
