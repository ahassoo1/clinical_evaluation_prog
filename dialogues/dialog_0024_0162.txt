DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, not to be rude, but can we hurry this up? I got things to do. It's… my stomach, I guess. Feels kinda puffy. Like I ate too much, but I haven't. It’s just…bloated. Been happening a while now, honestly. Don’t really know why you need me to explain it all, though.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” you say. That is…not particularly helpful, Mr. Kristofik. Vague symptoms require vague diagnoses, and I assure you, I do not practice vague medicine. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Months, okay? Maybe six? Something like that. Look, I work with heavy machinery all day, I don’t sit around keeping track of when my belly swells. It just…started. And it hasn’t gone away. Is that good enough for you? Honestly, I just want something to make it stop. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Six months of consistent bloating. Right. And is this bloating constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly after I eat, I think. But sometimes it's just…there. Like this morning. Woke up feeling like a balloon. It’s… uncomfortable, alright? I’m not a doctor, I don’t need to give you a detailed breakdown of every single puff. Look, is it something serious, or can you just give me something for it? I really don’t have time for tests and procedures and all that.
DOCTOR: “Something for it,” you say. Very well. Have you noticed any associated symptoms?
PATIENT: Associated… what does that mean? Like, do I feel sick or something? No, not really. Just…gassy, sometimes. And kinda tired, I guess. But who isn’t tired? I lift steel beams all day, doc. It’s hard work. Honestly, I don't see what all the questions are for. Is the gas related? Look, it's bloating and gas, okay? Is it bad? Can you fix it?
DOCTOR: So, six months of intermittent bloating, associated with gas, and some fatigue. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel…look, I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? What kind of question is that? No, nothing's changed. I haven't… look, this is ridiculous. Are you trying to embarrass me? I just want to know if this is something to worry about. I don’t need a full interrogation about…that. Seriously. This is a waste of my time. Just tell me if I need to be scared or not.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, with all due respect, you are being remarkably unhelpful. To determine if this is "something to worry about," as you put it, I require a complete history. However, since you seem so…resistant to providing it, I suppose we can proceed with a cursory examination. Please lie down on the examination table. And perhaps try to be a bit more forthcoming when I ask you questions. This isn’t a guessing game.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if this is just going to be more questions, I’m leaving. I got a job to do. Don’t expect a lot of detail. I told you, I don’t sit around analyzing my insides.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin. Lie flat, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Normal bowel sounds, but slightly…hypoactive. Tenderness upon palpation in the lower left quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness, thankfully. Tympanic throughout. And do you experience any pain with any specific foods?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really…specific foods, no. Maybe… beans sometimes give me gas. But pain? No. Look, I eat pretty much whatever. It’s not like I'm avoiding anything. I just feel…full. And bloated. Like I said. This is… a lot for some gas and bloating, doc. Are you sure there's even a problem? I'm starting to think I wasted my time coming here.
DOCTOR: “Beans sometimes give you gas.” Fascinating. Mr. Kristofik, your diet appears…unremarkable. And your description of your symptoms remains frustratingly vague. However, given the tenderness in the lower left quadrant, and the reports of bloating, we can’t entirely rule out certain possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Also, a stool sample. It's standard procedure, Mr. Kristofik. And I would like you to follow up with a gastroenterologist. I will provide you with a referral. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. Look, more tests? A stool sample? Seriously? This is getting ridiculous. A stool sample? I'm a pile driver operator, not a… laboratory specimen. I really don’t have time for this. And a…gastro…what did you say? This is a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. Just tell me if I'm going to die, doc. That's all I want to know. If it's something serious, fine, I'll go see your…specialist. If it's just gas, I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, your…dismissive attitude is not conducive to effective medical care. I understand your frustration, but I assure you, these tests are necessary to rule out more serious conditions. A stool sample will help us identify any potential infections or inflammation. And a consultation with a gastroenterologist…well, they are specialists in digestive health. It is prudent to seek their opinion, given your persistent symptoms. I am not going to offer a definitive prognosis without adequate diagnostic information. However, based on the limited examination, I suspect this is likely a functional gastrointestinal disorder, perhaps irritable bowel syndrome. But we must rule out other possibilities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Irritable…what now? Look, I don’t even know what that means. And I don’t want to know. I just want it to stop. Fine. Fine! I’ll do the tests. The blood, the…stool…whatever. But I’m telling you right now, if it’s nothing, I'm sending you the bill for the wasted time. And I’m not going to any…specialists. I got steel to drive, doc. Not time to sit around and talk about my…intestines. Give me the papers, let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab requisition is for a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample for occult blood and ova and parasites. The referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, gastroenterologist, is also included. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I strongly advise you to follow through with both. And please, Mr. Kristofik, attempt to provide more detailed information to Dr. Sharma. A vague history is rarely helpful. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…get it over with. I’ll… I’ll do the tests. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. .
