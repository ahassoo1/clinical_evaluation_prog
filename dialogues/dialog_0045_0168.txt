DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it’s about a… situation. A rather delicate situation, really. I’m beginning to date someone, and I simply want to be certain everything is… as it should be, health-wise. One doesn't want any unpleasant surprises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. A…pre-relationship check-up. Look, I appreciate you being proactive, but let's be clear: this isn't exactly a standard visit. I treat illnesses, Ms. Pandolfi, not…social concerns. Still, we can do some basic screening. It’s just… I have patients with real problems to see, you understand. So, tell me, what specifically are you concerned about?
PATIENT: Oh, I do understand, Doctor. Perfectly. One appreciates a physician who is… direct. And no, this isn't merely a "social concern." It's about responsible adult behavior, and frankly, prudence. I simply want reassurance. I suppose… sexually transmitted diseases would be the primary concern, wouldn’t it? I’ve been…celibate for a considerable period, and one doesn't know what sort of lifestyle this gentleman has led. It’s a matter of peace of mind, really. And perhaps a general check-up to ensure I haven't… acquired anything untoward. I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but one can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: Right. STDs. "Peace of mind." Look, I’m not going to hold your hand through this, Ms. Pandolfi. We'll run the standard panel – chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV. Hepatitis B and C are good to check too, given the…nature of things. Before we proceed, have you had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. That would be… distressing. I pride myself on being quite aware of my body, and I assure you, there has been nothing untoward. No unusual discharges, no itching, no… rashes. Perfectly normal, I assure you. I simply want a definitive answer, a clean bill of health, so to speak, before… things progress. It’s a matter of respect, for both of us.
DOCTOR: Alright, "perfectly normal." We’ll proceed as if that’s the case. Now, I need to ask some… less pleasant questions, just to cover all bases. Have you ever been diagnosed with an STD?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. That would be… unthinkable. I’ve led a very… respectable life, Doctor. A single, unfortunate youthful indiscretion, perhaps, but nothing that required medical intervention. I’ve always been very careful, very discerning in my… associations. This gentleman is… rather charming, but one can never be too certain, you understand. It’s better to be safe than sorry, isn't it? A clean slate, that's what I'm hoping for.
DOCTOR: Right. A "clean slate." Look, Ms. Pandolfi, I'm going to need you to be completely honest with me. “A youthful indiscretion” could still mean something relevant. Any previous partners?
PATIENT: Doctor Billman, are you implying I’m… being untruthful? I find that rather… offensive. I've had a few… companions throughout my life, naturally. A husband, many years ago, and a… gentleman friend or two after that. But nothing of consequence, certainly nothing requiring… ongoing treatment. They were all… upstanding members of society, as far as I was aware. And all… appropriately screened, I assure you. It’s simply a matter of due diligence, isn’t it? One wants to protect oneself, and one’s… potential partner. I believe I’ve been perfectly clear. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Pandolfi, this is necessary. I'm not implying anything, I’m asking direct questions. “Appropriately screened” in the 1980s is not the same as today. And frankly, relying on someone else’s word isn't sufficient. Let's be specific. Roughly how many partners have you had in your lifetime?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, this is becoming… terribly intrusive. Must we delve into such… private matters? It’s hardly relevant to a simple pre-relationship check-up, is it? Very well. Perhaps… four? Including my late husband. It’s hardly a… scandalous number, is it? And all were… adults, capable of making informed decisions. I simply don’t understand why this is so… important. Are you suggesting something untoward? Because I assure you, my lifestyle has been perfectly… respectable. And I resent the implication.
DOCTOR: Four. Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, thankfully no. No allergies whatsoever. I pride myself on being rather… robust, constitutionally speaking. I can tolerate most things, thankfully. Penicillin, of course, is generally well-tolerated, as are the usual analgesics. Though I rarely require medication, I assure you. A strong constitution and a healthy lifestyle, you understand. It’s quite fortunate, really. Is this all? I confess, this is becoming rather… draining.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Good. Now, what medications, if any, are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small dose of lisinopril, for slightly elevated blood pressure. Nothing to be concerned about, Doctor. The physician assures me it's perfectly manageable. And a daily vitamin, naturally. One must supplement, you understand. Maintaining one’s health is paramount. Nothing else, absolutely nothing. Is that sufficient? I truly believe we’ve covered everything of consequence. I do have a luncheon engagement, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril and a daily vitamin. We'll proceed with the STD panel and a basic blood work-up to confirm your current blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The nurse will draw the blood. It will take about a week for the results to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Although, I must confess, I find this whole process rather… unsettling. It feels as though I'm being treated like… a suspect, rather than a responsible adult seeking preventative care. However, if that is the standard procedure, then I suppose I have no choice but to comply. One doesn't want to cause a fuss, does one? Very well. Lead the way. I trust your nurse is… efficient? I do have a rather busy schedule, you understand. And I do dislike needles. A swift and painless procedure is all I ask.
DOCTOR: The nurse is perfectly capable. Just try to relax. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Pandolfi. I assure you, it won't take long. She’s right outside. I’ll review the results when they come in. Try not to worry. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your… thoroughness. I trust I’ll hear from you soon.
