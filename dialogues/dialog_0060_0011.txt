DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, Doctor… Nooruddin, is it? I need… a permission, I guess you’d call it. For somethin’ cosmetic. Don’t rightly recall all the details, but my… associate insisted I get cleared first. It’s important. Let's get this over with, if you please.
DOCTOR: “Associate,” alright. And “cosmetic”... that's… vague. I need a little more to go on than that, Mr. Honcoop. Is this something you've been planning for a long time?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I ain’t got time for a life story. It’s… a touch-up. A little fixin’. It’s not a big deal, really. Just need a paper sayin’ I’m healthy enough, or somethin’. Honestly, I don't recall exactly what they need cleared. They handled all that. Is that enough for you? I got things to do today.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I can't just sign off on something without knowing what it is. It's a medical clearance, not a formality. I need to understand the procedure you're considering to ensure it won’t negatively impact your health. Knowing your medical history is crucial. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness gracious. I’m a grown man, Doctor. I know if I’m allergic to somethin’. Dust, maybe. And… and loud noises. That's about it. Look, I used to work with towers, okay? Radio stuff. Cellular. It was… complicated. But this ain't about that. This is about gettin' a paper. I ain’t sick, I ain’t got nothin' wrong. Just a simple permission, that’s all. Are you gonna help me or not? Because frankly, I'm not sure why I bothered comin' here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but I need to ask some basic questions. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, there could be underlying conditions I need to be aware of before I can provide medical clearance. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High… what now? Diabetes? Doctor, I work with my hands! Towers, remember? I climb things! I don’t sit around eatin’ sugar all day. And my heart’s fine. Always been strong. Look, this is ridiculous. You're askin’ me questions my mama should be askin’, not you! I don't have time for this. I'm perfectly capable, and this whole thing is just… unnecessary. Are you gonna give me the permission, or not? Because if not, I’m leavin’. I got better things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I'm not going to provide medical clearance for a procedure I know nothing about. It’s irresponsible and unethical. I’m concerned about your well-being, and frankly, your dismissive attitude isn’t helping. I'm sensing you're not being entirely forthcoming. Let’s try this differently. What exactly is this “touch-up” your associate wants you to get cleared for?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I've had enough. You're accusin’ me of… of what? Not bein’ honest? I came here for a simple paper, and you're makin’ it into somethin' it ain't. This is a waste of my time! I don't need your permission, and frankly, I don't need your attitude. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Honcoop. I strongly advise you to reconsider. Proceeding with a medical procedure without proper evaluation could have serious consequences. .
