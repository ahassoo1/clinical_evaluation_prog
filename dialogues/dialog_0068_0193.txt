DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. It is… a bit embarrassing, truly. But I have… much gas. Too much gas. It makes me… uncomfortable, you understand? It happens often, and… well, it is disruptive. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Disruptive… I understand. Frequent gas, causing discomfort. Alright. And when did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… maybe six months ago? It was slow at first, just a little more than usual. But in the last two months, it has become… quite noticeable. I would say… every day now, several times a day. I apologize for being so… specific. It is just… a bothersome thing.
DOCTOR: No apology needed, Mr. Goodstein. Specifics are helpful. Several times a day for the past two months… Okay. And is it associated with anything in particular?
PATIENT: Associated… you mean, does it happen after I eat something? Yes, I think so. Usually… after meals. Not every meal, but… often. And sometimes… even when I haven't eaten. It is… peculiar. I did have a large cabbage dish last week, and it was… particularly bad then. But it happens even without the cabbage, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's often after meals, but not always, and even occurs when you haven’t eaten… and was worse after the cabbage. Any particular type of food that seems to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me consider… Beans, certainly. And… milk. I enjoy a glass of milk with dinner sometimes, and… that seems to make it worse. Bread, too. Especially… the darker breads. Not the white bread. But… it is hard to say for certain. I eat many different things. It is not always easy to pinpoint exactly what causes it. I am not a very… particular eater, you understand?
DOCTOR: Beans, milk, darker breads… Okay. And any other symptoms alongside the gas?
PATIENT: Alongside… you mean, do I feel sick in other ways? Sometimes… a little bloating, yes. And… a slight rumbling sound. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. And… occasionally, a little bit of heartburn. Not often, but it happens. But the gas is… the main problem, truly. It is quite embarrassing in public, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bloating, rumbling, occasional heartburn… I see. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No nausea or vomiting. Never. Just… the gas, the bloating, the rumbling. And… the occasional bit of heartburn. Nothing… serious. I do not feel ill, truly. Just… uncomfortable. It is… a nuisance, you understand? A bothersome nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Changes… yes, perhaps. Sometimes… a little looser than usual. Not diarrhea, truly, but… softer. And… occasionally, I have trouble going. Not often, but… it happens. It is not regular, you understand? Sometimes normal, sometimes a little loose, sometimes… a little difficult. It is… unpredictable. But I am an older man, you understand. Such things happen.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable bowel movements… Okay. Now, just to get a fuller picture, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I know of. I have never had a reaction to food or… medicines. I take no medicines currently. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed. But I am very careful. I only take what is needed. I am not a man who likes to take many pills, you understand.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, no current medications… Alright. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And… I drink very little alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner… once a month, if that. I am not a drinker, truly. I prefer water. It is better for the health, you understand? I try to be a healthy man. Even if I do have… this gas problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any stress currently?
PATIENT: Stress… hmm. That is a good question. I live alone, you understand. And… my wife passed away some years ago. I miss her very much. So, yes, I suppose I am a little… lonely. And that can be… stressful. But I try to keep busy. I enjoy gardening, and… reading. But… yes, there is some stress. Not terrible, but… it is there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Thank you for being so thorough. It sounds like we're dealing with a combination of factors here. It’s possible this is related to dietary sensitivities, a bit of gut flora imbalance, and perhaps some stress contributing to things. Would you be amenable to trying a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks?
PATIENT: Low… what did you say? Low-FODMAP? I am not familiar with that. Is that… a difficult diet? Will it involve… not eating anything enjoyable? I am not a very good cook, you understand. I mostly eat simple things. If it is too complicated, I do not think I could manage it. Could you explain it to me, please? Is it… expensive?
DOCTOR: It stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols. Essentially, it’s a temporary diet to reduce certain carbohydrates that can cause gas in the gut. It can be a little restrictive, but it doesn’t mean you can’t eat anything enjoyable. It involves avoiding things like onions, garlic, apples, pears, certain types of dairy... But there are plenty of things you can eat. It's not necessarily expensive, though it might require some adjustments to your grocery list. There are lists online, and I can provide you with one. It’s also a good idea to see a registered dietician who can help you tailor it to your preferences. Would you be open to trying that first?
PATIENT: Hmmm… onions, garlic, apples… I do enjoy those things. And… a dietician? Is that… someone I would need to pay extra money to see? I am on a fixed income, you understand. It is… difficult to spend money on extra things. Perhaps… perhaps I could try the list first? If it is not too complicated, I could see if it helps. But I am not sure about paying someone extra. Would it be possible to… try the list for a week or two, and then see if it makes a difference? Before I see the dietician?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can certainly try the list first. No need to rush into seeing a dietician if that's a financial concern. I'll print out a basic low-FODMAP diet guide for you now. It will take a few minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. It won't be uncomfortable, just a quick check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… very kind of you. Thank you for printing the list. And… listening to my abdomen? That is… alright. If it is a quick check, that is fine. I trust your judgment. I am… a little nervous, but I am trying to be helpful. I just want this… gas problem to go away. It is… quite disruptive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s a very common problem, Mr. Goodstein. Just relax, take deep breaths. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not particularly. It feels… normal. A little pressure, perhaps, when you press, but… not painful. A little rumbling sound, I hear, but… that is usual. I often hear rumbling. It is… part of the problem, you understand. It is not a sharp pain, or anything like that. Just… a little pressure. Everything feels… mostly normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant tenderness. Your abdomen is soft and not distended. I’m going to print out that diet list for you now. In the meantime, if the gas persists or worsens, or you develop any new symptoms like abdominal pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please don't hesitate to call the office. It's always best to be cautious. Here's the list. Take your time with it, and let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very agreeable. Thank you for your help. And… for the list. I will try my best to follow it. I appreciate your… patience. And your kindness. I will… call if things worsen. I just hope this… gas problem goes away. It is… quite disruptive, you understand. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. .
