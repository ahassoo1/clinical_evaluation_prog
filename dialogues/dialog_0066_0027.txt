DOCTOR: Hi Josie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this… stuff. Coming back up. All the time. It’s disgusting, really. And inconvenient. I’m a busy man. What do you need to know? Don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds very frustrating, and I'll do my best to be efficient. When you say "coming back up," are you referring to vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No, no, not vomiting. That’s… dramatic. It’s just… it comes up. Like, after I eat. A little bit. Not a lot, usually. More like… a return trip. It’s the principle of the thing, you know? I shouldn’t have to deal with this. It’s just… unpleasant. Do you understand? It's not like I’m throwing up, alright?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Josie. It sounds like regurgitation then – food coming back up shortly after eating. And you're right, that is unpleasant. To help me figure out what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When? Well, mostly after dinner. Big dinners. I like a good meal. And sometimes after lunch, if I… indulge. It doesn’t happen with breakfast, ever. Too early. And it’s worse when I lie down afterwards. I like to relax with the television, you know? But then… it happens. Honestly, my wife keeps telling me to wait a couple of hours before settling in, but what fun is that?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's after meals, more often dinner, and worse when you lie down soon after eating. That gives us a good starting point. How long has this been happening, Josie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… well, probably a good six months now, at least. Maybe longer. It started gradually, you know? Just a little bit here and there. I didn’t think much of it at first. Figured it was something I ate. But it hasn't gone away. And it's getting… more frequent. My wife finally insisted I come see someone. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening… I see. And is there anything specific you’ve noticed that seems to trigger it more often?
PATIENT: Spicy food, definitely. Anything with a lot of tomato sauce. And rich things. Cream sauces, heavy desserts… that sort of thing. I like my food, alright? I’m not going to start eating bland hospital food. My wife tries to get me to, but… no. And sometimes, if I eat too quickly. Though, honestly, who has time to eat slowly these days? I’m a busy man, I told you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so spicy foods, tomato sauce, rich foods, and eating quickly seem to make it worse. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, Josie?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, sometimes I get a bit of heartburn. A burning feeling in my chest. Not all the time, though. Mostly after those big dinners, the ones that cause the… the return trips. And occasionally, a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Like something’s… backing up. Is that important? Honestly, I’m not one for complaining about little things. But my wife… she makes a list. Always a list.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn and a sour taste in your mouth, especially after those larger meals. That's helpful information. Now, have you had any changes in your weight recently, Josie?
PATIENT: Weight? Honestly, no. I’m pretty consistent. Always have been. 185, give or take a pound or two. I watch my weight. Can’t be too careful, you know? Especially at my age. My wife weighs me every week, makes sure I’m… maintaining. She's very particular. I've not lost any appetite, either. I eat plenty. Too much, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weight loss, consistent appetite. Have you ever had any issues with difficulty swallowing, Josie?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No, no. I can eat anything. Steak, chicken, whatever. I don't have any trouble getting food down. It's what happens after that’s the problem. Honestly, I don't understand why you're asking all these questions. Are you going to give me something to fix this, or just interrogate me? I have things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem to be interrogating you, Josie. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be going on. It helps me narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, I had my prostate looked at a few years back, they said it was fine. A little trouble going to the bathroom sometimes, but that’s just age, you know? And my blood pressure runs a little high, but I take a pill for that. A small one. Nothing major. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy man for my age. I don't go to the doctor much. Waste of time, usually. Are we getting anywhere with this? Because frankly, I'm starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of prostate check-up being normal, and you manage your blood pressure with medication. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly, no. My wife handles all that. She keeps the list. I just take the little white pill every morning. She'd be furious if I messed up my medications. She's very organized. I think it starts with an 'A'... amlodipine? Is that right? Maybe. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to those things. I just take what she gives me. Don’t bother her, though. She's… particular.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that's good. And have you had any surgeries in the past, Josie?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. A long time ago. And I had a hernia repair… maybe twenty years ago? Something like that. It was a small one. Nothing serious. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. My wife would know the details. She keeps everything. Every medical record, every appointment… it’s a bit obsessive, really. Are we done yet? I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and a hernia repair about 20 years ago. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… My father had… something with his heart. He died young, actually. Heart attack, I think. My mother… she had diabetes. She wasn't very careful with her diet. And my sister… she had some sort of stomach trouble, ulcers maybe? She complained a lot. Honestly, it wasn't a very healthy family. Always something. Are we finally getting somewhere? Because I’m really not enjoying this. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, diabetes, and stomach problems. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me. And I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass. Red wine, good for the heart, they say. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I'm a respectable man! I have a business to run, a reputation to uphold. Honestly, these questions are insulting. I think I've answered enough. Can we please talk about what you're going to do about this? My wife is expecting a solution.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt insulting, Josie. I assure you, I’m only trying to get a complete picture of your health. Okay, so no smoking, occasional red wine. Now, one last thing before we move on to the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that’s just a mild irritation. Nothing serious. And I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to any medication. My wife always double-checks everything with the pharmacist, anyway. She’s very cautious. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated by the FBI. Can we please get this over with? I have a very important meeting this afternoon, and I'm wasting valuable time here. I'm a busy man, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergies. Thank you, Josie. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Don't poke around too much, alright? I have things to do. And be quick about it. My time is valuable. Honestly, I can’t believe I let my wife talk me into this. A waste of a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be as quick as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Careful! What are you doing? It's a little tender there, yes. Especially after dinner. It feels… bloated. Like something’s… full. But it's not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Honestly, I don’t like being touched. It’s… intrusive. Can we get this over with? My wife is expecting results. She's very demanding.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’m being as gentle as possible. I notice some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, particularly on the right side, as you mentioned. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of gastritis or possibly GERD – gastroesophageal reflux disease. The regurgitation, heartburn, and tenderness in your abdomen could all be related to that. However, to be sure, I’d like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to rule out any infection, and a stool test to check for Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria that can cause stomach inflammation. I also recommend an endoscopy – a procedure where we use a small camera to look at the lining of your esophagus and stomach. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tests? An endoscopy? Are you serious? That sounds… unpleasant. And invasive. I don’t like the sound of that at all. I thought you were going to give me a pill or something! Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I’m a busy man! I don't have time for tests and procedures. And what about the bacteria you mentioned? Is that contagious? My wife… she's very sensitive. I’m not sure I want to put her through that. Look, can’t you just give me something for the heartburn? Something to stop the… the return trips? I’m willing to try that. But I’m not having any cameras shoved down my throat. Not now, not ever. Tell me what pill you recommend. A simple solution, alright? That’s all I want. A simple solution. And don’t tell me I need more tests. My time is valuable, and I’m not wasting it on this nonsense. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Josie. And I respect your wishes. While an endoscopy would provide the most definitive diagnosis, we can start with a trial of medication to see if it helps alleviate your symptoms. I recommend a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, called omeprazole. It will help reduce the amount of acid in your stomach, which can help with the heartburn and regurgitation. We’ll start with a standard dose – 20 milligrams once a day, before breakfast. I also recommend avoiding spicy foods, tomato sauces, and rich, fatty meals as much as possible. And try to stay upright for a few hours after eating. We can reassess in a few weeks and see if the medication is helping. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, then we can discuss the possibility of further testing. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. A pill. That’s acceptable. Omeprazole, you said? 20 milligrams. Before breakfast. I can manage that. And I’ll try to avoid the spicy food, though it won’t be easy. My wife will be pleased. She's always telling me to eat healthier. But if this doesn't work, I’m not coming back. Understand? I’m a busy man, and I don't have time for this nonsense. Now, can I go? I have a very important meeting to attend. And please, send the prescription to my pharmacy. It's Miller's Pharmacy, on Oak Street. Do you need any further information?
DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. I’ve noted your concerns and will send the prescription for omeprazole 20mg to Miller’s Pharmacy on Oak Street. I’ll also provide you with a printed summary of our discussion and instructions on how to take the medication. Please contact the office if you experience any side effects or if your symptoms worsen. And remember, if the medication doesn't provide relief within a few weeks, we can discuss further options. I wish you all the best, and I hope you feel better soon. It was good to meet you, Josie.
