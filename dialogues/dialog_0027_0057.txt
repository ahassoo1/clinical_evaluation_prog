DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you. It’s… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Yes, I… I believe I reviewed some preliminary reports. Cancer, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. They… they found something. I don’t really know where exactly, or… what kind. They just said I needed to see an oncologist, and… well, here I am. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very clear. It’s just… a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: No, no, you’re perfectly clear. It is overwhelming. Let's take it slowly. I’m looking at your chart now… it appears there’s a referral note from Dr. Ramirez regarding a possible…lymphoma?
PATIENT: Lymphoma… yes, that sounds right. Dr. Ramirez did say something about… the lymph nodes. Is that… bad? I don’t know much about any of this, to be honest. My husband… he always handled things like this. It’s only been a few months since he passed, and I'm… still getting used to everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to not know the details. And dealing with this on top of everything else… that’s a lot. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes, which are part of your body’s immune system. There are different types, some more aggressive than others. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine exactly what we’re dealing with. First, though, can you tell me about when you first noticed something was… off?
PATIENT: Off… well, I started feeling tired. Just… really tired. More than usual. And then I noticed… these lumps. On my neck, mostly. They didn’t hurt, not at first. I thought it was just… swollen glands, maybe from a cold. But they didn’t go away. They’ve been getting bigger, slowly. That’s when Dr. Ramirez sent me here. It’s been maybe… two months now? I'm not very good at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: Two months… alright. And has the tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant. Some days are worse than others, but… even on good days, I still feel… drained. Like I haven’t slept enough, even when I have. And… I’ve been having night sweats, too. I wake up soaked sometimes. It’s… unpleasant. I had to change the sheets a couple of times.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't been trying to diet or anything. And… sometimes I get a fever. Not a high one, just… a little warm. And I've been feeling… itchy. All over, really. It’s… annoying, more than anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. And when you say itchy, is it a generalized itch all over, or is it concentrated in certain areas?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly all over. But it’s worse on my chest and back. Like… after I shower. It gets really bad then, and I have to use lotion to try and calm it down. Sometimes it keeps me up at night. It's… frustrating. I'm sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize. This is all important information. Okay, so generalized itching, worse after showering… Have you tried any new soaps or detergents recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I've been using the same things for years. It's definitely new. I… I don't think it's the soap. It just started, out of nowhere. I'm… starting to get worried now. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Chellsea, these symptoms – the fatigue, the lumps, the night sweats, the weight loss, the itching – they do warrant further investigation. It's too early to say definitively, but they are consistent with lymphoma. However, there are other possibilities, and we need to rule those out. The good news is, we have tests that can help us get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to let me conduct a physical examination and order some blood work and possibly a biopsy of one of the lymph nodes?
PATIENT: A biopsy… that sounds… scary. But… yes. Yes, I want to know. I need to know. Please, do whatever you think is best. I just… I want this over with. I want to know what’s happening. And… what can be done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. I understand. A biopsy can feel daunting, but it's the most accurate way to determine what we're dealing with. We’ll explain the procedure in detail before we do anything, and you’ll have plenty of time to ask questions. First, let me conduct a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and assess your overall condition. Then we'll draw some blood for a complete blood count and other tests. Once we have those results, we'll discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things. Let's… let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me… I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your lymph nodes, starting with your neck. I’m noting some enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of your neck. They feel… slightly firm, not overly tender. There’s one on your right side that's a bit larger than the others. We'll want to get a closer look at that one. Now, I'm going to check your armpits and groin as well. Okay. I’ve finished the physical examination. I’ll need to order some blood work and a biopsy of the enlarged lymph node on your right neck. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. My husband always took care of those things. How long will it take to get the results? And… what happens after the biopsy? Will it… hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. As for the results, the blood work usually takes about 2-3 business days. The biopsy results will take a little longer, typically 5-7 business days, as they need to be analyzed by a pathologist. As for the biopsy itself, you'll receive local anesthesia to numb the area, so you shouldn’t feel any significant pain during the procedure. There may be some mild discomfort or tenderness afterward, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. We'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for the biopsy site. Is there anyone you'd like to have with you when we schedule the biopsy?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t have anyone. My husband… he passed a few months ago. I’m alone now. It’s alright, though. I can… I can handle it. Just… please, let’s just get it done. The sooner I know… the better.
DOCTOR: I understand. And I’m very sorry for your loss. You are not alone in this, Chellsea. We’ll be with you every step of the way. Let's focus on getting these tests done. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll schedule the biopsy as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to call my office. I’ll put in the orders for the blood work now. Do you have any questions before I call the nurse in?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. I’m ready, I guess. Let’s… let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. That's the spirit. I'll just give the nurse a call and she'll be right in to draw the blood. It will only take a few minutes. "Hi, Sarah?
