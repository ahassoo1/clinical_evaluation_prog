DOCTOR: Right. Derick Miner... 59. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's… my face. And my legs. They're kinda puffy, see? Not huge, but… not right. Been like this a few days, I guess. Honestly, I don't keep track of that sort of thing. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: "A few days." Right. And this "puffiness"...is it worse in the morning?
PATIENT: Morning? Hmm… maybe. Could be. I get up, have my coffee, and then… well, it's just there. I mostly notice it when my wife… used to fuss over me. She always noticed things. Now… it's just me lookin' in the mirror, and thinkin' it doesn't look right. It's not painful, if that matters. Just… swollen.
DOCTOR: Swollen. Okay. And you said your face is also affected?
PATIENT: Yeah, my face. Mostly around… well, all over, I reckon. It feels kinda tight, like. Not like a pulled muscle, but… full. I tried lookin' closely, but it's hard to tell. I ain’t got the eyesight I used to, you know? And it's not like I'm goin' anywhere fancy where anyone would notice. Though, she always said I had a handsome face. Before… well, nevermind. It just looks… different.
DOCTOR: Right. Any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. I eat what I always eat. Toast, usually. Sometimes a bit of ham. And coffee, lots of coffee. Don't go for those fancy things, all those salads and… whatchamacallits. Never did. She tried to get me to eat better, but… I'm a simple man. No changes, not that I recall. Unless… did the ham brand change? I buy it from old man Hemmings down the road, he gets it wholesale. Maybe he changed something. Wouldn't surprise me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I can breathe fine. Always have. Though, sometimes I get a little winded walkin' up the stairs. But that's just 'cause I'm not as young as I used to be. And the stairs are steep, you know? Old house. Not like these newfangled places with everything on one floor. So, no trouble breathin', not really. Why would I be havin' trouble breathin'? Is that what the puffiness means? You tellin' me my breathin's bad?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm asking questions. Let's stick to the topic, alright?
PATIENT: Well, you're askin' the questions! I'm just tryin' to answer 'em. It's hard to stick to a topic when you jump around. You asked about breathin', now you're tellin' me to stick to somethin'? What is the topic, exactly? The puffy face and legs? 'Cause that's all I'm talkin' about. It's just… annoyin', that's all. And my wife… well, nevermind. Just the puffiness. That's it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for sniffles or rashes. I work with metal all day, welding and such. You'd think I'd be allergic to something by now, right? Smoke, fumes… but no. Always been pretty tough, I reckon. She used to say I was stubborn, but that’s the same thing, isn't it? No allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: And you're currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Haven’t touched a pill in… well, a long time. Never really needed 'em. Just coffee. Lots of coffee. She… she used to keep some for her arthritis, but I didn’t bother with that sort of thing. Didn’t seem right. So, no. No medications. Just the coffee. Why are you askin' all these questions? You think I'm lyin' about somethin'?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. I'm going to take a look at your face and legs, if that's alright. Just a quick examination.
PATIENT: Examination? Fine. Whatever you gotta do. But don't go pokin' around too much, alright? I ain't one for bein' fiddled with. And don't tell me nothin' I don't need to hear. Just… look at the puffiness. That's all. And be quick about it, I got things to do. Though, what things, I can't rightly remember… Nevermind. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Face is…slightly edematous. Bilateral pitting edema, +2 in the lower extremities. Skin is warm to the touch. No visible rashes. Lungs are clear to auscultation. I'm going to order some basic bloodwork. CBC, CMP, and a lipid panel. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Now hold on a minute. You're just gonna poke and prod and then take my blood? What are you lookin' for? What's wrong with me? I don't like the sound of "rule things out". Sounds serious. And I ain’t insured, you know. This is gonna cost me a fortune. What am I even payin' for, if you're just gonna poke and prod and then run tests? I just came in for a little puffiness!
DOCTOR: Look, it's standard procedure. The bloodwork will give us a baseline. It’s probably nothing, but we need to be thorough. As for payment...we'll figure something out. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. I'll have the lab draw results sent to me, and we'll discuss them when they're back. In the meantime, try to limit your salt intake and drink plenty of fluids.
PATIENT: Limit my salt? Drink more fluids? What is this, a lecture? I just told you, I drink plenty of coffee! That's a fluid, isn’t it? And I don't even use salt. She always handled the cookin’. You're tellin' me I gotta change my whole life over a little puffiness? This is ridiculous. Look, I ain't payin' for all this pokin' and prodin' and tests. And I don't want a lecture on salt. I just want to know why my face is puffy! Forget it. I'm leavin'. .
