DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s this sensitivity to light, really. It’s been getting worse lately, and it’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. Especially bright days.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity to light… photophobia, as we call it. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe six months ago, but it was just a little bit at first. Like, squinting more than usual. But the last month or so, it's been pretty bad. Like I need sunglasses even indoors sometimes. It’s hard to explain… it’s not just brightness, it feels… painful, almost, in my eyes.
DOCTOR: Painful, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, I know it sounds strange. Not like a sharp pain, more like… a deep ache. And everything seems really washed out, even with sunglasses. It makes it hard to focus, too. It's been a bit worrying, to be honest. My wife… she always took care of these things, and… well, it’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Right. So, photophobia for six months, worsening over the last month, with associated eye pain and visual disturbance. Visual disturbance… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sorry. It’s like… things aren't as clear. Colors seem… faded, and sometimes I see little… floaty things, like dust motes, even when it’s clean. And it's not just when I'm looking at bright light, it's kind of all the time, but worse afterwards, you know? It makes driving a little scary. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Floaties… and decreased color perception. Hmm. Have you had any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been a bit tired, but honestly, who isn’t? And maybe a few headaches, but I get those sometimes anyway. Nothing major. Oh! Actually… I think my eyes feel gritty sometimes, like there’s something in them, even when I blink a lot. Is that… related?
DOCTOR: Gritty sensation… could be. Let’s go through some basics. Any changes in your vision besides the floaters and faded colors?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. It’s hard to explain… sometimes things seem… blurry at the edges of my vision. Like looking through a slightly dirty window. It comes and goes, mostly when I’m really tired or staring at something for a long time. I hadn’t really thought much of it, honestly, just figured it was my age. I'm 32, but... my wife used to say I always needed glasses anyway.
DOCTOR: Peripheral blurring, photophobia, floaters, decreased color perception, gritty sensation… Alright. Now, have you had any medical conditions diagnosed previously?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. Just the usual colds and flu. I'm generally pretty healthy. I do have Medicare, though, since… well, since my wife passed. They haven’t really found anything wrong with me, thankfully. I don't take any regular medication, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. No chronic illnesses, no medications. Family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… that’s a good question. My mum had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had some problems with his eyes when he got older, something to do with the pressure, maybe glaucoma? I’m not really sure, I wasn't very close to him. On my wife’s side, her mother had diabetes, but that’s about all I remember. Sorry, I'm not much help with that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Uh… I work as a dental assistant, so I'm around a lot of bright lights and close-up work all day. Not much time for hobbies, to be honest, not since… well. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I guess I spend a lot of time indoors, now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at your eyes. If you could sit up here for me, please. I'll need to check your vision, and examine your eyes a bit more closely.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Komarov, can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay… um… L, T, F… P… C… uh… and… G… I think. It’s a little blurry, to be honest. Is that… good?
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s a bit reduced, as expected. Now, let’s check your peripheral vision. I’m going to have you focus on this point, and I’ll be moving something in your peripheral vision. Just tell me when you see it.
PATIENT: Okay, focusing on the point… … I think I see something… over there… on the left? It’s kind of faint.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now I’m going to take a look inside your eyes. The optic discs appear slightly pale, and there's some mild cupping… and the vessels… some attenuation of the arterioles… Hmm. No significant hemorrhages or exudates noted. Pupil reactivity is normal… and extraocular movements are intact. Alright. Based on what I'm seeing, and your symptoms, it appears you may have early signs of… glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
PATIENT: Glau-what now? Is that… bad? My wife, she always knew these things… what does that mean? Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It means the optic nerve – the nerve that connects your eye to your brain – is showing signs of damage. Glaucoma, specifically, is often associated with increased pressure inside the eye, though it can occur with normal pressure as well. And yes, it is something you need to take seriously, as it can lead to irreversible vision loss if left untreated. However, we’ve caught it early, which is good. We need to confirm this with some further testing. I'm going to order a visual field test, a gonioscopy to assess the drainage angle of your eye, and an OCT scan of the optic nerve. I will also want to measure your intraocular pressure multiple times over the next few days to get a baseline. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Wow. Okay. That’s… a lot. Visual field, gon-what-sit, OCT… I’m not sure I understand all of that, to be honest. But, you said it can cause vision loss? And you want to check the pressure? That sounds… scary. Is there anything I can do now? Like, is there anything I should avoid? Or… is it just waiting for the tests?
DOCTOR: It's not an emergency, Mr. Komarov, but it does require attention. The tests will give us a clearer picture of the extent of the damage and guide our treatment plan. In the meantime, avoid straining your eyes – prolonged screen time, heavy lifting. And definitely avoid any medications that dilate your pupils without consulting with me first. I'm referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a specialist ophthalmologist. She'll schedule these tests and discuss the results with you. Here's the referral. She’s very good, and will explain everything thoroughly. You should schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I’ll… I’ll schedule something with Dr. Sharma right away. I guess… no, not right now. Just… it's a lot to take in. Thank you for… explaining things. And for not… rushing me. I appreciate that. .
