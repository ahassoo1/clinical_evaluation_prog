DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though, honestly, the particulars… they seem to slip my mind. Something about needing a… confirmation, I believe? For my work, naturally. It’s quite important, you understand. One must maintain standards.
DOCTOR: Right. A confirmation for work. Yes, I see a note here about a physical. Is there anything specific your employer is asking me to assess?
PATIENT: A specific… assessment? Hmph. They simply require I have it done, Doctor. A formality, really. Young people these days… so concerned with paperwork. I do believe it has something to do with… ensuring I can still see adequately to perform my duties. And perhaps hear. Though my ears are perfectly fine, thank you very much. I wouldn’t be doing my job if they weren’t. It's all rather… bureaucratic, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: So, primarily a vision and hearing check, then?
PATIENT: Primarily, yes. Though I suppose a general overview wouldn’t go amiss. One must be thorough, after all. It's… prudent. Though, I do trust you’ll keep it brief? I have several appointments this afternoon, and my time is rather valuable. Not that you would understand, being… well, never mind. Let us simply proceed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Oriley. We'll be as efficient as possible. Before we start, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… Well, I maintain a… respectable lifestyle. I don’t partake in any of those… modern vices. And I eat a balanced diet, when I can be bothered to oversee the preparation myself. I suppose I'm generally… functional. Though I do find myself a bit fatigued of late. Perhaps it’s the weather. Or the general decline in… standards, as I was saying. Is that the sort of information you require, Doctor? Or are we delving into… personal matters?
DOCTOR: Fatigue is good to know. Anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My knees, they ache a bit. Though, frankly, who doesn't have aching knees at my age? And my memory… is not what it once was. Though I assure you, Doctor, that does not reflect upon my professional capabilities. It’s merely… selective recall. One doesn’t need to remember everything, you understand. It’s quite inefficient. Is that helpful? I'm trying to cooperate, but you're asking such… vague questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! What kind of question is that? I am perfectly healthy, thank you very much. A little fatigued, perhaps, and my knees ache, but those are minor inconveniences. Chest pain? Shortness of breath? Doctor, I assure you, I am not on my deathbed. One doesn’t simply develop those ailments overnight, you know. Though, I suppose people are more delicate these days… prone to hysteria and self-diagnosis. I’ve always been a robust individual. Now, are we going to get to the actual examination, or are we going to continue this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your vision. Could you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, the lighting in here is rather poor. Is that a… “F”? No, wait… it’s blurry. I believe it’s… difficult to ascertain. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, naturally, but I assure you, it's not a significant impediment to my work. Are you certain this chart is calibrated correctly? It seems… substandard.
DOCTOR: Let’s try this one. Just read whatever letters you can clearly see, starting from the top.
PATIENT: Right… let’s see. I can make out an “H”… and an “E”… a blurry “L”… oh, and perhaps a “P”. But the rest… they're quite indistinct. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not accustomed to straining my eyes like this. It's most uncomfortable. It seems my vision has deteriorated somewhat. Though, as I said, it doesn’t affect my professional judgment. One learns to compensate, you see. It’s a matter of experience. Are we nearly finished with this… ordeal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your hearing. I'm going to put these headphones on, and I'll play some tones. Just tell me when you hear a sound, any sound at all. We'll start with the right ear.
PATIENT: Headphones, you say? Are you certain those are properly sanitized? One never knows what sorts of… germs lurk on those things. Very well. Proceed. But do be quick about it. My time, as I’ve mentioned, is valuable. Now… I hear a faint… buzzing. Or is that the lights? It’s difficult to say. No, wait… there! A rather high-pitched tone. Yes, I heard something. A very faint something, mind you, but something nonetheless. It’s hardly conclusive, you understand. Are these headphones of adequate quality? I have rather discerning hearing, you know.
DOCTOR: And with the left ear?
PATIENT: With the left ear… It's… similar. A faint buzzing, like a distant mosquito. And yes, a tone. A very, very faint tone. I'm not certain I'm actually hearing anything, or if it's simply my imagination. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… inconclusive. Are you certain your equipment is functioning properly? I’m beginning to suspect this whole exercise is a waste of both our time. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Based on this brief assessment, your vision and hearing are mildly diminished, as you've noted. Nothing dramatically concerning, but it's worth monitoring. Do you have any family history of hearing or vision loss?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness, Doctor, that’s a rather broad question. My family is quite… extensive. And rather… private. I suppose my grandfather on my mother’s side was a bit hard of hearing in his later years. Though he spent most of his life at sea, shouting over the waves, so it’s hardly surprising. And my aunt… well, she was a bit eccentric, and spent a great deal of time staring at clouds. I doubt that contributed to any… clarity of vision. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance of this line of inquiry. It's hardly… scientific. Now, are we finished? I have appointments to attend to, you know. And a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Alright. As you said, mild decline is not unexpected. We'll document that. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no! I maintain a… very controlled lifestyle. I wouldn't dream of ingesting anything without careful consideration. I am not prone to… frivolous reactions. Though, I recall a rather unpleasant experience with some sort of shellfish many years ago. But that was a culinary mishap, not an allergy. Honestly, Doctor, are you implying I am some sort of… delicate constitution? I assure you, I am quite robust. Now, are we approaching the end of this… examination? I’m growing rather impatient.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, then. Alright, Mr. Oriley, based on this assessment, I'll document mild age-related decline in vision and hearing. I recommend routine follow-up with an optometrist and audiologist to monitor any changes. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Routine follow-up? Honestly, Doctor, the very idea! I assure you, my time is far too valuable to spend it in waiting rooms. And an audiologist? Goodness, no. I can hear perfectly well enough to conduct my professional duties, thank you very much. No, I have no questions for you. This has been… a rather inefficient use of my time, but I suppose it was necessary. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have appointments to attend to. And a reputation to uphold. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. Have a… good day. And please, do schedule those follow-up appointments. .
