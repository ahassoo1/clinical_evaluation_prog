DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… I want to know about my family. Way back. My kids, they want me to do one of those… DNA tests. To see where we come from, you know? I hear they can tell you a lot.
DOCTOR: That's interesting, Mr. Scobie. It’s becoming very common for people to explore their ancestry with DNA tests. And it can be quite informative. Before we discuss the tests themselves, is there anything specific about your family history that prompted your children to suggest this?
PATIENT: Well… my grandma, she come from… not here. Long time ago, on a boat. I think… Marshall Islands. But nobody really talks about it. Just stories. My kids, they want to know for sure. They want to… fill in the blanks, I guess. I don’t know much myself. Just what I heard when I was little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better understanding. So, you have a family history suggesting origins in the Marshall Islands, but limited concrete details. It’s wonderful your children are interested in learning more about their heritage. Before we talk about the DNA tests specifically, let’s just briefly touch on your medical history. It's always helpful to have a complete picture, and sometimes family history can reveal important health information. Have you been generally healthy, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty good. Old age is catching up, you know? Joints ache a bit. And I get tired easy. But nothing… serious. I have Medicare, so they check me up every year. I don’t remember anything bad happening. I mostly just… make things. Little boats, mostly. Wood.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy, and it's wonderful you have regular check-ups with Medicare. Making boats sounds lovely – a very creative hobby! The aches and tiredness are common with age, but we should still make a note of them. Do the aches affect your ability to do your hobbies, or any daily activities?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not too bad. Harder to hold the little tools, you know? And I can't work as long. I used to work all day. Now… a few hours. I mostly just sit and do it when I feel up to it. Not a big problem. It’s okay. I got time now. Didn’t always have time.
DOCTOR: That’s good you're still able to enjoy your craft, even with some limitations. It’s important to stay active and engaged, and making boats sounds like a wonderful way to do that. Let's switch back to your family history for a moment. You mentioned your grandmother coming from the Marshall Islands. Do you know anything about when she came, or if other family members came with her?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. I was just a little boy. I think… after the war. Maybe? People didn’t talk much about it then. I remember… a big boat. Lots of people. And my grandma, she was always… quiet. Sad, maybe? She didn't say much about where she come from. Just… stories. About islands and… fish. I don’t know if anyone else came with her. I think… maybe her sister? But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Scobie. Memories fade over time, especially from childhood. It sounds like your grandmother may have had a difficult experience, and it's not uncommon for people to be reluctant to share painful memories. Given your grandmother’s history and your children’s interest in tracing your ancestry, a DNA test could potentially provide some helpful information. There are several companies that offer these tests, and they vary in terms of their accuracy, cost, and the information they provide. Would you like me to briefly explain how these tests work and what kind of information they can reveal?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. I don’t understand all that… DNA stuff. I just want to know… where we come from. What kind of people we are. Is it… complicated?
DOCTOR: It can be a little complicated, but we can go through it step by step. Essentially, these tests analyze your saliva sample to look at specific markers in your DNA. These markers can indicate your ancestral origins – which regions of the world your ancestors likely came from. Most tests provide an estimated percentage breakdown of your ethnicity. For example, you might find out you are 60% Marshallese, 20% Japanese, and 20% something else. It's important to remember these are estimates based on comparisons to large databases, and they aren't always 100% accurate. The tests can also sometimes identify distant relatives who have also taken the test, which can be interesting. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. The accuracy of the tests can vary depending on the company and the regions they have well-represented in their databases. And sometimes, the results can be surprising or even conflicting. It's also important to be aware of potential privacy concerns, as these companies collect and store your genetic information. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. So… they look at spit and tell me what people my grandma was mixed with? It's not… exact? And it might not be right? And they keep my spit forever? That sounds… a little scary.
DOCTOR: You’ve summarized that perfectly, Mr. Scobie. Yes, they analyze your saliva to estimate your ancestral origins. And you are right to be cautious - it’s not an exact science, and the accuracy can vary. And you're also right to be concerned about privacy. Most companies will state how they store and use your data in their terms of service. Some allow you to download your raw data and delete your sample after testing, while others keep it for research purposes. It’s very important to read those terms carefully before you agree to anything. There are several companies out there, some more reputable than others. 23andMe and AncestryDNA are two of the more well-known options, but there are others. They all have different pricing and features. Before you decide to pursue a test, we can discuss what you are hoping to gain from it, and I can help you research the different companies and understand their privacy policies. We can also consider whether any potential findings could have implications for your health, and if so, whether genetic counseling might be helpful. Would you like to talk about that?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Talking about it, I mean. I don't want to give my spit to anyone without knowing what they do with it. And… what if it tells me something bad? About health? I don't want to worry my kids. They already worry too much. They just want to know about grandma, that's all.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible concern, Mr. Scobie. You are right to think about the potential implications for your health, and for your children's peace of mind. Some DNA tests do include information about your genetic predisposition to certain health conditions. However, it's important to understand that these tests don't give you a definitive diagnosis. They only indicate your risk of developing a condition, and many factors contribute to whether or not someone actually gets sick. Most companies will allow you to opt-in or opt-out of receiving health information. And if you do choose to receive health information, you have the right to discuss the results with a healthcare professional before making any decisions. We can also consider genetic counseling. A genetic counselor can help you understand the implications of the test results, and can provide support and guidance if you have any concerns. Perhaps before we talk about specific tests, let’s clarify what information your children are hoping to find out. Is it purely ancestral information, or are they interested in health-related information as well?
PATIENT: Just where we come from, I think. They said grandma always talked about the islands, but she never said which islands. They just want to know… the story. Fill in the blanks. They don't want to worry me about health stuff. Just… the people. The old, old people. They're good kids. Always thinking about family.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like they have a lovely reason to be interested in their family history. So, if it’s purely ancestral information they’re looking for, we can focus on companies that specialize in that. 23andMe and AncestryDNA both offer comprehensive ancestry reports. FamilyTreeDNA is another good option, particularly if they're interested in connecting with distant relatives. They all have websites where you can compare their features and pricing. I can provide you with links to those websites, and we can discuss the pros and cons of each option. Before we do that, are there any other questions or concerns you have about DNA testing?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s good. Websites… okay. I’ll need my son to help me with that. He’s good with computers. Just… where to start. And… what if it tells me something I don’t want to know? About… people? Like, if grandma wasn't who we thought she was?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Scobie. It is possible that a DNA test could reveal unexpected information about your family history. While rare, it's important to be prepared for that possibility. Sometimes, tests can reveal discrepancies in family records or uncover previously unknown relationships. While this can be upsetting, it's important to remember that these tests are just one piece of the puzzle. Family history is complex, and records aren't always accurate. It's also important to remember that you have the right to choose what information you share with your family. If you uncover something unexpected, you're not obligated to tell anyone about it. Before you decide to pursue a test, we can discuss your concerns and develop a plan for how to handle any unexpected findings. We can also talk about resources for support and guidance, such as genetic counselors or family history researchers. Would you like me to write down the websites for those companies, and we can schedule another appointment to discuss this further?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. Websites and… another appointment. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little less scared now. It’s a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm glad I could help ease some of your concerns. It is a lot to think about, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Here are the websites: 23andMe: [https://www.23andme.com/] AncestryDNA: [https://www.ancestry.com/dna] FamilyTreeDNA: [https://www.familytreedna.com/] I’ll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week. We can review the websites, discuss your concerns, and develop a plan for how to proceed. In the meantime, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I'll talk to my son and we'll look at those websites. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a wonderful day as well.
PATIENT: .
