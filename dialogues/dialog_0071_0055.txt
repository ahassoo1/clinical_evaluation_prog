DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Please, have a seat. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about this medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my… discomfort. I believe that’s the polite way to put it. I must confess, I was rather skeptical at first, but she insists it’s the modern thing. And frankly, I’d like to explore all options before resorting to… stronger measures.
DOCTOR: Right, medical marijuana… for discomfort. Okay. And what kind of discomfort are we talking about, Ellan?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, it’s… everything, really. The joints, of course. Old age, you know. And a bit of trouble sleeping. And sometimes… just a general feeling of being out of sorts. It’s not like I’m in agony, mind you. But it’s… persistent. It interferes with my bridge club, and that simply won’t do. I’m a rather good player, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, joint pain, trouble sleeping, and a general feeling of… unwellness, impacting your daily life. Let's try to get a better picture of this, shall we?
PATIENT: Well, “unwellness” is rather a vague term, isn’t it, Doctor? I prefer to be precise. It’s a… a lack of vitality. And it’s not impacting my daily life in a catastrophic way, don’t misunderstand me. I still manage my household perfectly well. It’s just… inconvenient. And frankly, rather irritating. It’s lowering my average score at bridge.
DOCTOR: Lowering your bridge score, yes, that is a serious matter. Right. And when did you first start noticing these symptoms, Ellan?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… gradual, really. Perhaps a year or so ago? It started with a little stiffness in my hands after gardening, and then… well, it just sort of escalated. It wasn't sudden, you understand. I'm not one for dramatics. My husband always said I was very level-headed. Though he did say I could be… particular.
DOCTOR: A year ago, gradual onset. Stiffness in the hands initially. And has anything specific worsened the symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, living does. It seems to worsen with… existing. Cold weather, of course. Damp weather. And, frankly, dealing with my grandson. He means well, but he insists on playing that… that music at an ungodly volume. It rattles my nerves, I assure you. Perhaps that’s contributing. I haven’t thought of that before. A very distracting din, it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, cold and damp weather, and… grandson’s music. We’ll add that to the list. Now, let's talk about your past medical history, Ellan. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? My history? I’ve lived a very sensible life. No need for history, I assure you. A touch of indigestion occasionally, but nothing a bicarbonate of soda couldn’t fix. And I had the flu, oh, years ago. But I recovered perfectly well, thank you very much. I'm not a sickly person. My daughter is always trying to get me to have tests for everything under the sun, but I simply refuse. They're a waste of time, and frankly, rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. No need to delve into anything you're uncomfortable with. Just trying to get a complete picture. Any surgeries, Ellan?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Heavens, no! I would never allow anyone to tamper with my perfectly good body. A touch of varicose veins, years ago, but I had them tied off. A very discreet procedure, done by a very reputable doctor. That was… oh, decades ago. Before your time, I imagine. It wasn't a major operation, mind you. Just a little snip here and there. A necessary evil, really, to maintain a presentable appearance. I’ve always taken pride in my appearance.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. A mixed bag, really. My husband, bless his soul, passed away five years ago. Heart trouble. Very sudden. My daughter, she worries too much. Always has. And my grandson… well, he's a musician, as I mentioned. Loud, enthusiastic, but not terribly practical. My brother had arthritis, I believe. A very debilitating condition. He moved to Florida to escape the damp. Sensible man, that was. Didn’t suffer fools gladly, either. A bit like me, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Husband passed with heart trouble, daughter worries, grandson a musician, brother with arthritis. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Ellan?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, you seem determined to fill me with pills! No, absolutely not. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Good food, plenty of rest, and a sensible amount of exercise. And bicarbonate of soda, of course, for the indigestion. That's all. I refuse to be reliant on artificial substances. It's a matter of principle, you understand. I’ve seen what those pills do to people. Make them sluggish, dependent… quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications except for the occasional bicarbonate of soda. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor. I’ve lived a full life, I assure you. I’ve eaten everything, been everywhere. No, I don’t have any allergies. A mild sensitivity to dust, perhaps, but nothing a good duster couldn't handle. I’m a remarkably robust individual, you see. I don’t succumb to these modern… sensitivities. A bit of common sense and a strong constitution, that's all one needs.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, Ellan, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose. But please be gentle, Doctor. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. And I do have a rather delicate constitution, despite what I’ve said. And please, no cold instruments. They give me the shivers. And do try to be quick about it. I have a bridge game this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be late. My partner gets rather cross if I’m not on time. A very competitive woman, she is.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. Gentle and quick, I promise. Now, if you could just follow me over to the examination table… First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very well. But do try not to poke and prod too much, Doctor. I’m a woman of a certain age, you see. And I do have my pride. And please, do warn me before you touch me. I don't appreciate surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. I’ll explain everything as I go. Now, if you could just take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, rate is… 78. A little murmur, but not concerning at this age. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing or crackles noted. Good. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Some mild swelling in the finger joints, consistent with possible arthritis. Skin is warm and dry. Blood pressure is 130/80, also within normal limits for your age. Alright. Everything appears within reasonable limits for a woman of your age. Now, let's just take a look at your range of motion in your shoulders and elbows. Can you raise your arms above your head for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not as high as I used to, I’m afraid. It's a bit stiff, you see. And it’s rather uncomfortable. Do be careful, Doctor. I don’t want to pull anything. It's all these years of bridge, you know. All that reaching and shuffling. A very demanding game, it is. A bit of pain, yes, but one perseveres. One must maintain one's standards. Is that sufficient? I'm not entirely certain I can manage much more. It’s the damp weather, I suspect. Always makes my joints ache. A perfectly reasonable explanation, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, some limited range of motion and mild tenderness in the shoulders. Now, just a quick check of your feet. Any swelling or pain in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Well, there’s a bit of a bunion, on this side. It’s been there for years, mind you. A perfectly harmless imperfection. And my feet do tend to swell a bit in the summer. Perfectly natural, you know. All the heat. And I do like to wear rather elegant shoes. They’re not terribly practical, I’ll admit, but one must maintain appearances. A bit of discomfort, yes, but one endures. One has standards, you see. Is that sufficient? I'm growing rather tired of being poked and prodded, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems you’re experiencing some age-related joint pain, likely osteoarthritis, with some minor discomfort in your shoulders and feet. The mild murmur is likely benign. It's not surprising, given your age and activity level. Now, before we discuss treatment options, are there any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: Osteo… what did you call it? Honestly, Doctor, all these medical terms. I simply want to know if this… discomfort… warrants medical marijuana. That’s the whole reason I’m here, you see. My daughter keeps saying it will alleviate my symptoms. And frankly, I’m rather tired of being uncomfortable. Will it help my bridge game? That’s my primary concern, you understand. And will it cause any… unpleasant side effects? I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ellan. Regarding medical marijuana for your discomfort, it can be helpful for some people with osteoarthritis, particularly for pain and sleep disturbances. However, it’s not a guaranteed solution, and there are potential side effects to consider. Some people experience dizziness, drowsiness, or changes in appetite. It can also interact with other medications you might be taking, although you're not currently on any. And it can affect your cognitive function, potentially impacting your concentration and reaction time. Whether it will affect your bridge game is difficult to say. It depends on how you react to it. If it causes significant drowsiness or cognitive impairment, it could certainly have an impact. Given your concerns about maintaining your bridge performance, I would recommend starting with a very low dose and carefully monitoring your response. We could also explore other treatment options first, such as physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, or, if the pain is significant, a referral to a rheumatologist for a more specialized evaluation. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist? Heavens, no! I refuse to be subjected to any more poking and prodding. And physical therapy sounds… undignified. I simply want something to alleviate my discomfort, Doctor. Something that won’t interfere with my bridge game. A low dose, you say? And it could affect my concentration? That’s unacceptable. Tell me, Doctor, are there… less risky alternatives? Perhaps something topical? A cream or a salve? Something I can apply discreetly, without any unpleasant side effects? And won't show up on any tests, if I were to, say, travel. I do enjoy a cruise now and then, you see. One must maintain a certain lifestyle, you understand.
DOCTOR: Topical treatments are a reasonable option, Ellan. There are creams and salves containing capsaicin or CBD that can provide some pain relief, although the effectiveness varies. They are generally well-tolerated, with minimal side effects. CBD, in particular, is less likely to cause cognitive impairment than medical marijuana, and it is less likely to interact with other medications. It’s worth trying, as a first step. We could also discuss over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, although those do come with their own risks and potential side effects, so they should be used cautiously. And to answer your question about testing, CBD products generally do not show up on standard drug tests. However, it’s important to check the label and ensure that the product is third-party tested for purity and potency. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a CBD cream and discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options?
PATIENT: A CBD cream… third-party tested, you say? Yes, that sounds… acceptable. And a list of those over-the-counter remedies. But nothing too strong, mind you. I don’t want to be drowsy or… incoherent. A small dose, as always. And if it doesn’t work, I suppose I could consider one of those medical marijuana things, but only as a last resort. And only if you assure me it won’t ruin my bridge game. Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But please be precise with your instructions. I don’t appreciate ambiguity. And do write everything down, for my daughter. She tends to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I'll write you a prescription for a CBD cream with 500mg of CBD, and I’ll also provide you with a handout detailing some over-the-counter pain relief options, including acetaminophen and ibuprofen, with clear instructions on dosage and potential side effects. Start with a small amount of the CBD cream, applied topically to the affected areas twice a day, and see how you respond. If that doesn't provide sufficient relief, you can gradually increase the amount, but always follow the instructions on the label. And if you decide to try the medical marijuana, we can discuss the different strains and delivery methods, and I'll provide you with a list of reputable dispensaries in the area. Do you have any other questions for me, Ellan?
PATIENT: Dispensaries… hmm. Yes, that sounds… complicated. I suppose I'll need my daughter to help with that. And what about travel? Will this cause any problems at the airport? No, I believe that is all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And please, send the bill. I have a bridge game to prepare for.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. Regarding travel, it’s generally safe to travel with CBD products, as long as they are derived from hemp and contain less than 0.3% THC. However, it’s always a good idea to check the regulations of your destination country before you travel, just to be sure. Here’s your bill, Ellan. And if you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. And enjoy your bridge game. I hope you have a wonderful time. Have a good day, Ellan.
