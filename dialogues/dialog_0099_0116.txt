DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor… Overgaard, is it? Yes, thank you kindly. Well, it’s my legs, you see. They… bother me at night. A cramping sort of feeling. It’s been going on for… well, a good while now. I can’t rightly say how long, exactly. Time… slips away, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Leg cramping at night. A “good while,” you say. Okay. And is it both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Both, I believe. Yes, both legs. Not always at the same time, mind you. Sometimes just the left, sometimes just the right, and sometimes… well, both at once. It wakes me up, usually. Not terribly painful, but… unsettling. It feels like they’re going to… knot up, I suppose. Is that… a proper way to describe it? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: "Knot up" is… descriptive enough. And how often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Most nights, I think. Or… nearly every night. It’s hard to be certain. I do try to get a good sleep, you see. I used to… well, never mind that. But yes, often. Very often. It’s become… a regular thing, I suppose. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. Just a few moments, usually, then it goes away. But it’s enough to disturb a body. Do you… need me to be more specific? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s… adequate for now. But we need to rule some things out. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh, let me see. Not that I’ve noticed, no. My feet feel… normal, I think. They might be a bit… wider than they used to be, perhaps? But I’ve always had… substantial ankles. No, I don’t think I’ve seen any swelling, Doctor. Not recently, anyway. Are you looking for… puffiness? Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Puffiness, yes. Okay. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I’ve lived a long life, you see. There’s been a bit of this and a bit of that. My hip… bothers me sometimes, getting up and down. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, as you can see. But nothing… serious, I don’t think. Nothing the doctor ever needed to do anything about. Just… old age, mostly. I had a touch of… the flu, a few years back, but I recovered. Does that count? I truly can't recall much else. My memory… isn’t what it once was. Are you looking for anything in particular?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture. Any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago. And… oh dear. I believe I spent a night in the hospital once, many years back, when I broke my wrist. Fell off a ladder, helping my husband with the roof. But that was… a very long time ago, Doctor. Beyond that… I don’t believe so. Nothing major, certainly. I was always a healthy girl. Mostly. Do you need the dates of these things? I wouldn't be able to tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My husband, bless his soul, passed away… oh, it must be twenty years now. We didn't have any children, no. I had a sister, Margaret, but she… she passed away a few years back as well. I have a nephew, I believe, somewhere in… California, perhaps? I haven't seen him in a very long time. We weren't very close, I’m afraid. It's just me now, Doctor. Just me. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It can be. Now, do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a little something for my… water. You know, for my bladder. A small white pill. And sometimes, if my hip is acting up, I take one of those over-the-counter pain relievers. The orange ones. But that's it, Doctor. Just those two. Nothing else. I try to keep it simple. Are you concerned about… interactions? Is that what you're asking? I do try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Not that I know of, no. I've always been able to eat anything. And I've never had a reaction to any medicine, not that I recall. I used to help my mother with her gardening, and I've handled all sorts of plants, and never had any trouble. No, I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. I'm a pretty sturdy sort, usually. But thank you for asking. It’s good to be thorough, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Let’s take a look at your legs. If you could just lie down for me. I’m going to check your pulses and reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I haven't been on one of those in quite a while. Is there anything… I need to do? Just lie flat? I hope I'm not too much trouble, Doctor. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Pulses are present, though a little weak. Skin is… dry, with some age spots. No visible swelling. Reflexes are diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Okay. Now, I suspect this is likely due to poor circulation and possibly some nerve compression. It's common in older individuals. We can try a few things. But first, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he tried it once, a very long time ago, but didn’t care for it. And alcohol… well, I used to have a small glass of sherry on special occasions, but I haven’t had a drink in years. Not since… well, never mind that. No, I don’t smoke or drink, Doctor. Always been a teetotaler, mostly. Is that… helpful? Does that make a difference? I just want to be sure I’m doing everything right.
DOCTOR: It can. Alright. I'm going to recommend you start taking a daily multivitamin, specifically one with vitamin D. And I want you to try to elevate your legs for 30 minutes each day. That will help with the circulation. We can also discuss some gentle stretching exercises. But, given your age and the lack of significant findings, I don’t think further investigation is necessary at this time. If the cramping worsens or you develop any new symptoms – like pain, numbness, or discoloration – you’ll need to see me right away. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A multivitamin, and elevate my legs. I can do that. And stretching… I used to be very flexible, you know. Perhaps I can regain some of that. And see you if it gets worse. Yes, I understand. I’ll be sure to come right away if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. I appreciate your time. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should be… avoiding?
DOCTOR: Just try to stay active, within your limits. And stay hydrated. A little walking each day can be helpful. I’ll write you a prescription for the multivitamin. The nurse will go over the instructions with you. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Just the multivitamin and elevate my legs. And stay active. Thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. I'll be sure to follow your instructions. Is… is there a cost for this visit? I wasn’t informed… I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time. Perhaps the nurse can assist me with that?
DOCTOR: The nurse will handle that. It’s… a sliding scale, given your circumstances. She’ll explain everything. Alright. You can get dressed now. And have a good day, Ms. Bilstein. .
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A sliding scale… that’s kind of them. Yes, a good day to you too, Doctor. Thank you again for your time. .
