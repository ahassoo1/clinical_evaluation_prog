DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor Pitmon. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. Keeps coming back. And with it, these…water infections, I believe they call them. It's been happening for a while now, and it’s starting to wear me down a bit.
DOCTOR: "Water infections," right. Okay. And how long has this been going on, this pain and the infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the pain started, I’d say, maybe two years ago? Not constant, at first. But the infections… they’ve been more regular the last year, I think. Every few months, at least. It’s hard to keep track, you know.
DOCTOR: Two years for the pain, a year for the recurring infections… alright. And where exactly is this pain located?
PATIENT: It’s on my side, lower down. On both sides, actually, but more often the left. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you see? Sometimes it feels like a pressure, like something is…full.
DOCTOR: Both sides, dull ache, pressure… and does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, lying down sometimes helps a little. But it doesn’t always take it away completely. And drinking lots of water, I think… that seems to help with the infection part, but not the pain so much. Nothing really makes it go away, to be honest. It just comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. And you mentioned these "water infections." Have you been officially diagnosed with urinary tract infections by a doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. I’ve been to the clinic a few times for them. They always give me something to drink, a pink liquid, and tell me to drink plenty of water. And it usually clears it up, for a little while at least. I don’t remember the name of the medicine, though. I'm not very good with names, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, pink liquid... alright. Let’s move on. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits along with any of this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, thankfully. I haven’t been sick to my stomach, no. And my…bowels have been alright, I think. Nothing different there. It’s not something I usually talk about, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We don't need to dwell on that. Now, do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, the doctor told me a while back that my kidneys aren't working as well as they should. Something about lots of little… pockets in them. He said it’s something I was born with, and there’s not much to be done about it. I don't remember the name of it either, I'm afraid. I take Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Lots of little pockets…” Right. Polycystic kidney disease, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s it! Polycystic… that’s what he said. Yes, that’s exactly what it is. It’s been… a long time since I saw that doctor, you see. I just remember the name vaguely. Yes, that’s it. Polycystic kidney disease.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy, a very long time ago. But that was here in Fiji, you see. And that's about it, I think. No hospital stays, no other surgeries. I’m pretty sure, anyway. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had problems with her blood pressure, I think. She was always getting headaches, and the doctor told her to watch her salt intake. And my brother, he had diabetes, but he lived in another part of Fiji, you see. I haven’t seen him in many years. Other than that… I don't really know much about my family history, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol either. And certainly not… recreational drugs. No, no. I just like a nice cup of tea, you see. Very sensible, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Let's get a quick physical exam done. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It's just a routine check, you see. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Just a little help getting onto the table, if you wouldn’t mind. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get you up here. Careful now… Now, just lie flat, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath… and another one…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Deep breaths, you said? Yes, I can do that. Just let me know if you need me to do anything else. It’s a little cold on my back, you see.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain anywhere. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… a little bit there. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, you see? It’s been like that for a while now. Just a little bit tender, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit sensitive too, Doctor. Not as bad as on my side, but… definitely something there. It feels…full, you see? Like something is pressing on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And the right side?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit there too, Doctor. Not as much as the left, but… it's there. It’s hard to explain, you see. It’s just a general ache, all over really. It's been like this for so long, I'm almost used to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve reviewed your EHR. Polycystic kidney disease, as you mentioned, diagnosed several years ago. Recurring UTIs. Now, based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you're experiencing chronic flank pain likely related to your PKD, and the recurring UTIs could be secondary to this. It’s not entirely uncommon.
PATIENT: So… it is something to do with my kidneys? I was starting to think I was imagining things, you see. What does that mean, Doctor? What can we do about it? I’m just tired of being in pain all the time.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Espinueva, we can’t cure PKD, unfortunately. It’s a progressive condition. But we can manage the symptoms. The pain is likely due to the enlarging cysts. For the UTIs, we'll need to ensure you're staying well-hydrated and maintain good hygiene. We will order a urinalysis to check for infection and kidney function tests to monitor your kidney health. We’ll also discuss some pain management options, though these are typically limited.
PATIENT: So…more tests? I've had so many tests over the years, you see. Pain management…what sort of things are we talking about, Doctor? I'm not keen on taking lots of strong medication, if I can help it. And what about these UTIs? Is there anything I can do to stop getting them so often?
DOCTOR: Well, we can discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. But frankly, they're unlikely to provide significant relief with PKD. For the UTIs, beyond hydration and hygiene, there's not much you can do preventatively. We can prescribe prophylactic antibiotics, but long-term antibiotic use is not ideal. Honestly, Mr. Espinueva, you need to accept that recurring UTIs may be part of your condition. I’m ordering the labs now. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: So… more tests, potentially more antibiotics, and…just live with the pain? That’s… not what I was hoping for, Doctor. Is there anything else we can try? Perhaps a specialist? Someone who deals with kidney problems all the time? It’s just…it's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: A nephrologist consult is…an option. I can certainly write a referral. But frankly, Mr. Espinueva, they will likely tell you the same thing. PKD management is largely supportive care. I will order the urinalysis and kidney function tests, and write the referral. For now, focus on hydration and good hygiene. Take the over-the-counter pain relievers as directed. We’ll review the results at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think…I think that’s all. Thank you for your time. I suppose…I suppose I’ll just have to get on with it then. Thank you, Doctor.
