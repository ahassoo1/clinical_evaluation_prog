DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. That’s why I am here. I want to get this over with as quickly as possible, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Reihner. We’ll do our best to be efficient. “Painful” is a bit broad, though. Can you tell me more specifically where you’re experiencing pain?
PATIENT: It is… in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? It’s hard to keep track. It hurts when I bend over, and when I lift things, of course. It just… aches all the time, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain for about a month, worsened by bending and lifting, with a constant ache. Do you remember anything specific that might have started it?
PATIENT: I do. I was helping my neighbor, Old Man Hemlock, fix his fence. I lifted a pretty heavy post… and then pop. Not a loud pop, but I felt something give. I thought it would get better with rest, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a specific inciting event – lifting a heavy post while helping your neighbor. That’s helpful. And you haven't noticed any pain radiating down your legs, numbness or tingling in your feet or hands, or any weakness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the back. No tingling. No weakness. It's just… sore. A deep, constant sore. And sometimes sharp, when I move wrong. It hasn't spread anywhere else, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything helped with the pain at all?
PATIENT: I tried some of those heat wraps… the ones you stick on. They help a little, for a few hours. And I take ibuprofen sometimes. It doesn’t really take it away, but it makes it… less noticeable. Not much else, to be honest. I mostly just try to avoid doing anything that makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, heat wraps and ibuprofen provide some minimal relief. Good to know. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any back problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. This is… new. I’ve always been strong, always worked hard. This is the first time I’ve had trouble with my back. It’s… frustrating. I don’t like being slowed down.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, and have you had any other medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my appendix out when I was a girl, a long time ago. And I have Medicare, of course. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy. Nothing major. I’m a simple woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, otherwise generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years for colds and headaches, never had a reaction. I don’t take many pills regularly, though. Just the ibuprofen when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. I eat a decent diet, try to stay active when my back allows. Just… simple living, as I said. I don’t bother with a lot of fancy things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history, if that’s alright. Does anyone in your family have a history of back problems, arthritis, or other joint issues?
PATIENT: My mother had arthritis in her hands, when she got older. That’s about it. My father was a strong man, never had any trouble with his back. My brother… he broke his leg once, but nothing like this. It hasn’t been a big problem in my family, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, your mother had arthritis, otherwise no significant family history of back problems. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone. My husband passed away ten years ago. I spend most of my time tending to my garden, helping out neighbors when I can. I don't smoke, never have. I drink a little tea sometimes, but nothing strong. And I try to stay busy. I don’t sit around much. That’s about it. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Let's get it over with. I just want to know what's wrong and how to fix it. The quicker the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your stomach on the examination table, please. I’m going to start by feeling along your spine to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. I’ll also ask you to move in certain ways to see how that affects your pain. Let me know if anything causes sharp pain. First, can you point to the exact location where you’re feeling the most discomfort?
PATIENT: Right… here. It’s not just on the spine, but close to it. And it radiates a little bit to both sides, but mostly right here. It’s a dull ache, mostly, but it gets sharp when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling along your spine now. Alright, can you slowly try to bend forward and touch your toes, if you can?
PATIENT: Ouch. That… that's about as far as I can go. It’s sharp, right here. It's not unbearable, but it's… unpleasant. I don't want to push it too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No need to push through any significant pain. Now, if you could lie on your back for me, please. I'm going to check your reflexes and see how your legs feel. I’ll also gently lift each leg to see if that causes any pain. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Go ahead. Just… be careful. I don’t want to make it worse. I need to be able to work, you see. Fences don't fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your legs now… I'm checking your reflexes... and can you gently lift your right leg for me?
PATIENT: There… that’s a little uncomfortable. Not terrible, but… I feel it in my back. It’s not shooting down my leg, just… a pull in my back. It’s the same spot, always the same spot. It’s like something’s pinched.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now your left leg… Alright, that's helpful to know. I’m just feeling along your hips now. And nothing radiating down your legs, correct?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing down my legs. Just… the back. Always the back. It’s… frustrating. I’ve never had trouble with my back before. I need to know what’s wrong and what I can do about it. Can you tell me something yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. The specific inciting event – lifting that heavy post – and the localized pain and muscle spasms are consistent with that. The straight leg raise was negative, which is reassuring. It doesn't indicate any nerve involvement at this time. However, the persistent pain warrants further investigation to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order a lumbar X-ray to check for any fractures or other structural abnormalities. It’s just a precaution. And I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the spasms and pain, and recommend continued ibuprofen as needed. I also want you to ice the area for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, for the first few days, then switch to heat. And please, avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until the pain subsides. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I need to get back to work. The muscle relaxant and ibuprofen… that’s fine. And ice and heat… I can do that. No lifting… that will be difficult, but I understand. So, you don’t think it’s anything serious? Just a muscle strain?
DOCTOR: That's my initial assessment, yes. Most likely a muscle strain or sprain. But the X-ray is just to be completely sure and rule out anything else. It's better to be safe. We'll get the results back within 24-48 hours, and I’ll have the nurse contact you with the results and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—like numbness or tingling in your legs, weakness, fever, or difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. No new symptoms… and I'll wait for the nurse to call. I appreciate you not making me wait too long. Thank you for your time. I suppose I should go get this X-ray done then. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The X-ray department is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will check you in and get you scheduled. I've already sent the order over electronically. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here is the prescription for the muscle relaxant. Take care, Ms. Reihner. And try to rest.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I will.
