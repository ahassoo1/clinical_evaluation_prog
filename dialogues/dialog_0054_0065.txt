DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I've been… gaining weight, and I haven’t been able to figure out why. It's rather unsettling, to be honest. It feels like it came on quite suddenly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Unexplained weight gain can definitely be unsettling. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. When you say suddenly, could you give me a rough timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began, I would say, around… late February, perhaps early March of this year. It wasn’t dramatic at first, just a feeling that my clothes were fitting a little more snugly. But over the past few months, it’s become quite noticeable. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine, which is… well, minimal, admittedly, but it is my routine.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly five or six months. And you haven't made any changes to your diet or exercise habits during that time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely none. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. Mostly traditional Lithuanian fare, to be honest – potatoes, cabbage, things like that. Not a great deal of… salad, I suppose. And I walk to the market a few times a week, but that’s about the extent of my exercise. It's always been enough, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And when you say “enough,” how would you describe your energy levels normally, and have you noticed any changes in that area alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Normally, I feel… adequate. I can manage my day, keep up with the house, see friends. Not bursting with energy, certainly, but not fatigued either. However, lately, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual. It's not debilitating, but I find myself needing to rest more frequently, and I'm a little less motivated to do things. I simply don’t have the same… pep, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue alongside weight gain is something we definitely want to explore. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… Now that you mention it, yes. My skin has been… drier than usual. And I seem to be feeling the cold more easily. My husband, Petras, keeps saying I'm looking a little pale, too, but I've always had rather fair skin, so I didn’t pay much attention to that. It’s probably just the summer being overcast. But perhaps it's related? I truly don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin, feeling colder than usual, and your husband noticing paleness – those are all potentially relevant clues. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, my bowel habits haven't changed at all. Perfectly regular, as they always have been. Sorry to be so… blunt, but I thought you’d want to know. It's been one of the few things that hasn't changed, which is… reassuring, I suppose. Though not terribly helpful in understanding the weight gain.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, and good to know. It’s helpful to rule things out. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I've always been quite healthy, all things considered. A few colds, a touch of the flu now and then, but nothing serious enough to require a diagnosis or regular treatment. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, that sort of thing – but that was many years ago. My mother had… some arthritis in her later years, but that’s the only family history of note, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries at all. I’ve been fortunate in that regard, as well. I'm not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. It makes me rather anxious, being around illness all the time. So, thankfully, I haven't had much need of them. I prefer to stay healthy and avoid them if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. I avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if it can. I might take a bit of chamomile tea if I’m feeling stressed, but that's the extent of it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no pain relievers… nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I am aware, I have no allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. No hives, no swelling, no breathing difficulties… nothing. Petras occasionally teases me about having a cast-iron stomach, but I suppose I have been rather lucky in that regard as well. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm hoping we can get to the bottom of this soon. I’m rather anxious about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Reneisha. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your thyroid gland. It will just take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I understand it’s necessary, and I trust your judgment. I'm eager to find out what might be causing this, so I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Reneisha. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your heart and lungs sound good. However, your thyroid gland feels slightly enlarged and firm. This, combined with your symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, and feeling cold, leads me to suspect you might have hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will measure your thyroid hormone levels and help us determine if your thyroid gland is functioning properly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Hypothyroidism… is that serious? And what does it involve? Blood tests are fine, certainly. Anything to get a diagnosis. Just… please tell me what to expect. And whether it’s treatable. I’m rather worried, you understand.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Reneisha. Hypothyroidism is quite common, and thankfully, it’s usually very treatable. Essentially, your thyroid gland isn't producing enough thyroid hormone, which slows down your metabolism. That can cause the symptoms you’ve been experiencing – weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, feeling cold. The blood tests will give us a clear picture of your thyroid function. We'll check your TSH and T4 levels. If the tests confirm hypothyroidism, the treatment is usually a daily thyroid hormone replacement medication – levothyroxine. It’s a very safe and effective medication. Most people feel significantly better once they start treatment. It might take a few weeks to find the right dosage, and we’ll monitor your levels regularly to make sure you’re getting enough medication. It’s important to get this diagnosed and treated, but it's also important to remember that it’s a manageable condition. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: That… that sounds manageable, yes. And significantly better is good to hear. Levothyroxine… is it expensive? I… I don’t have insurance, you see. And Petras and I are on a fixed income. It’s a concern. Everything else sounds alright, but the cost of medication is… rather pressing. Perhaps there’s a generic version? I truly appreciate you explaining it all so thoroughly, Doctor. It’s eased my anxieties somewhat. But the cost… that’s what worries me most.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Reneisha. You’re right to ask. Thankfully, levothyroxine is available as a generic medication, and it's generally quite affordable. The cost varies depending on the pharmacy, but it’s typically a relatively inexpensive medication, even without insurance. I can write the prescription with that in mind – specifying the generic version. Also, I can check with our clinic’s patient assistance programs. Sometimes we can help connect patients with resources that offer discounted or free medications. I'll have our medical assistant look into that for you after the appointment. We also have a social worker on staff who can help you explore other options, if needed. Let’s start with the blood tests, and then we’ll focus on the medication cost. I want to ensure you have access to the treatment you need, regardless of your financial situation. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… wonderful. Truly. The generic version is a relief, and the patient assistance programs are a godsend. I’m very grateful. I simply… worry about finances, you understand. But knowing you’ll look into it… eases my mind considerably. Yes, let’s proceed with the blood tests. Whatever I need to do. I trust your judgment entirely. I’m ready whenever you are. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… remarkably kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Okay, I’ll have the medical assistant come in and draw some blood for the tests. It will only take a few minutes. After the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And remember, we’ll work together to find a solution that works for you. Do you have any questions for me before the medical assistant comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been exceptionally thorough and kind. I truly appreciate your understanding and willingness to help. I’m simply… relieved. Thank you again. Please, call the assistant when you’re ready. I'll do my best to remain calm.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. You’ve been a very good patient, asking all the right questions. Don’t worry about remaining calm, we’ll take things one step at a time. “Maria, could you please come in and draw some blood for Reneisha Selbitschka?
