DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re with Medicare and we’re located in a rural area, so I appreciate you making the trip in. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. It just… stays in there. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not a real long while, but long enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Trouble with complete bladder emptying. And you said this has been going on for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. Maybe a month or so? It comes and goes, but mostly it’s… there’s always a little left. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it feels… full, even after I go. And I have to… try a few times sometimes. It's embarrassing to talk about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Mr. Hilber. It’s quite common, actually. So, about a month, with intermittent issues, but a persistent sensation of incomplete emptying… and you sometimes have to attempt urination multiple times to feel like you’ve gone?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. That sounds about right. It’s… it’s not every time, but often. And sometimes it feels like it takes a long time to start, too. Just… slow. I don’t know if that makes any sense. I'm not good with explaining things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. Don't worry about explaining things; I’ll ask clarifying questions. You mentioned it takes a long time to start sometimes. Could you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well, I sit there… and I push, but nothing comes out for a bit. It just… takes a while to get going. Like a slow engine, maybe? Not a strong stream at first. It’s hard to explain. It's not painful, it's just… weak. And then after a bit, it'll start, but it's not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, hesitancy – difficulty starting the stream – and a weak stream, in addition to the incomplete emptying and the sensation of residual urine. Have you noticed any changes in the force of the stream over time, or is this a more recent development?
PATIENT: It’s been getting weaker, I think. It’s hard to say for sure, because… well, I don't pay that much attention, usually. But I remember it being stronger. Definitely. And… now that you ask, sometimes I have to strain a little to get it going, where I didn’t before. It's not a lot of strain, but I notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Gradual weakening of the stream and now some straining to initiate urination. Have you experienced any difficulty with stopping the stream once you’ve started, or any leakage?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. I can stop it fine. And no leakage. It’s just… getting it started and making sure it’s all out. That’s the trouble. No accidents or anything like that, thankfully. I wouldn't want that.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, odor, or anything unusual?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The color seems normal, I guess. It’s… yellow, like it should be. And the smell… I don't really pay attention to smells much, if I’m honest. Maybe a little stronger sometimes, but I figured that was just from drinking more water. I’ve been trying to drink more water, you see, to help with the problem.
DOCTOR: Trying to increase your fluid intake is a good idea. So, no significant changes in urine color or odor. Now, have you had any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or pain in your back or flank?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. No fever, no chills. My belly feels alright. And no pain in my back or sides. Just the… trouble with the water, like we said. It’s just a bothersome thing, really. Not a terrible pain or anything, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, prostate problems, neurological issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I was told I had high blood pressure a long time ago, but I don’t take any pills for it now. The doctor said it was alright. Other than that… not that I know of. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. My wife… she was the one with all the doctor appointments. I mostly just stayed out of it.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, currently not medicated. And no other known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia fixed once, but it was a long time ago too. Before my wife passed, I don't really remember much about it. I wasn’t very involved in the details then, either.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and hernia repair, both in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. And I haven’t had any trouble with medicines. My wife always checked everything, so I never really worried about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Nothing. Just… water. Trying to drink more water, like I said. I don’t take any pills or anything like that. I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn't like it. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not very often. And no, I don’t use any… other things. Never have.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That will involve checking your abdomen, and a neurological exam to check your reflexes, and I'll need a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to get this figured out. A urine sample… alright. Where should I go?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. The bathroom is just down the hall to your left. There’s a collection cup in there, and instructions on how to provide a clean catch sample. Please just bring it back to me when you’re finished. After that, we'll do a quick abdominal and neurological exam. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright. A clean catch… I think I remember something about that. Just gotta… try to get a good sample. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I tried my best to get a good sample. It wasn’t easy, but I think it’s alright.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. I appreciate it. I’m going to send this off to the lab for analysis, just to rule out any infection or other abnormalities. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table. Alright, Mr. Hilber. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and I don’t feel any masses. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits neurologically.
PATIENT: Alright. That's good to hear. Everything seems alright then? It's just… the water, like we said. What do you think it is, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Based on your reported symptoms and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s a common condition in men your age, where the prostate gland enlarges, causing difficulty with urination. However, to confirm this, we need to review the results of your urine analysis. We will also need to perform a PSA blood test to get a better understanding of your prostate health. While BPH is often the cause of these symptoms, it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as prostate cancer. Do you have any questions so far, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Prostate… BPH? I think I heard of that before. It’s… not serious, is it? And a PSA test… is that a blood test? What does that test for exactly? It sounds a little scary, all this talk about… well, about the prostate.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Hilber. BPH itself is not typically life-threatening, but it can cause uncomfortable symptoms and affect your quality of life. Many men live with it for years with minimal impact. The PSA test is a blood test, and it measures the level of prostate-specific antigen. It's a marker that can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated in other conditions, like BPH or infection. That’s why it’s important to get a baseline reading and monitor any changes over time. We're not jumping to any conclusions here. We're simply gathering information to make an accurate diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment, if any is needed. For now, I’m going to order the PSA test and a complete urinalysis. Depending on the results, we may consider further testing, like an ultrasound of the prostate. Do you have any allergies to blood draws?
PATIENT: No allergies to blood draws, no ma'am. I’ve had blood tests before, no trouble. So, you're saying it might not be serious? Just… an enlarged prostate? What do you do about that, if it is just an enlarged prostate? Are there pills for that? And will this PSA test take long? I have a friend coming to visit next week, I'd like to know what I'm facing before he gets here.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Mr. Hilber. BPH is the most likely explanation for your symptoms, but we need to confirm that with the tests. There are medications available to help manage the symptoms of BPH, like alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. These can help relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder, and reduce the size of the prostate, respectively. There are also less invasive procedures available if medications aren't effective, but we’re not at that stage yet. The PSA test results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. We will discuss treatment options once we have the lab results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. I think so. Drink more water, no caffeine, no alcohol… and wait for the test results. And then we’ll talk about pills, maybe. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. It’s a little scary, all this talk about the prostate, but I feel a little better knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Hilber. I understand your concern, and I’m glad I could provide some clarity. I will also give you a written summary of our discussion and the tests I’ve ordered. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or inability to urinate, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Hilber. Get well soon. .
