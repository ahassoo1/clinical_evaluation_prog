DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… unpleasant. A soreness in my mouth. It’s been bothering me for a few days now. Frankly, I haven’t much time for this, so if we could be swift, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re busy, so I'll do my best to be efficient. "Soreness in your mouth" – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: It’s…white. Patches. On my tongue, mostly. And it hurts to eat, especially anything…acidic. Or sweet. It feels like little cuts, almost. It’s…unsightly, you understand. Not something one wants to be dealing with.
DOCTOR: I do understand. White patches and pain with acidic or sweet foods… that gives me a starting point. Has this soreness been getting worse, staying the same, or improving since it started a few days ago?
PATIENT: Worse, certainly. It was a minor irritation initially. Now… now it’s genuinely disruptive. I had to refuse a perfectly good mango this morning. A perfectly good mango, Doctor. It's…unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay, getting worse is important to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain and white patches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No, not really. Perhaps a bit… fatigued. But I work long hours, so that’s hardly surprising. I don't see what that has to do with a bit of discomfort in my mouth, frankly. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Fatigue can sometimes be related, even if indirectly. It's good to ask about everything. Okay. Have you noticed any fever, difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your taste?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Difficulty swallowing? Hardly. I eat perfectly well, when I can bear to eat. And changes in taste… well, everything tastes rather unpleasant at the moment, if you must know. That’s the point of coming here, isn't it? To fix the unpleasantness? Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance of these… elementary questions.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem elementary, Antoine. I need to gather as much information as possible to figure out what's going on. Alright, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. I’m a perfectly healthy man. I work hard, I eat… reasonably well, and I generally avoid doctors. This is a rare occurrence, and I’d like to keep it that way. I assure you, I haven't a list of ailments to recite. Are we moving towards a diagnosis, or simply cataloging my lifestyle choices?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Why on earth would I be hospitalized? I take care of myself. Surgeries? The thought is… appalling. I’ve never needed, nor will I ever want to need, a surgeon's knife. Honestly, Doctor, these questions are quite intrusive.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family? That's… a complicated question. My extended family is… numerous. And largely preoccupied with their own affairs. I couldn’t possibly recall the medical histories of every aunt, uncle, and cousin. It's… irrelevant. They lead very different lives than I do. I doubt their ailments would apply to a man of my constitution. Are we still on this?
DOCTOR: Okay, no family medical history readily available. Have you had any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I’ve occasionally experienced… mild indigestion after consuming certain shellfish, but I attribute that to the quality of the restaurant, not a genuine allergy. No, I’m not allergic to anything. I can assure you. It’s a waste of time asking about such things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I rely on a healthy lifestyle and strong constitution, not pills and potions. I wouldn't dream of polluting my system with such things. The very idea is… barbaric. Are we approaching a conclusion, Doctor? I have matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, would you mind if I take a quick look inside your mouth to examine the white patches?
PATIENT: Examine my mouth? Is that…absolutely necessary? It seems rather… invasive. I assure you, it's just a bit of soreness. Surely, a diagnosis can be made without resorting to such unpleasantness. But… very well. If you insist. Just… be swift about it. I have a very important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Antoine, open wide for me… Alright. I see white patches on your tongue and some redness in your mouth. They don’t appear to be deeply ulcerated, but they are quite extensive. Can you tell me if these patches are easily wiped off, or do they adhere firmly to your tongue?
PATIENT: Easily wiped off? I… I haven't tried. I didn't think to scrub my tongue, Doctor. It's painful, you see! They seem… firmly attached, yes. Quite unpleasant. And please, be gentle. I have a very sensitive palate. Honestly, this is most undignified. Get it over with quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. They do adhere quite firmly and don't wipe off easily. And there's some mild redness around the edges of the patches. This looks consistent with what we call oral thrush, or oral candidiasis. It's a fungal infection. It's not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Do you use any inhaled steroids, like for asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Fungal infection? You're telling me I have a… a fungus in my mouth? Preposterous! I assure you, my hygiene is impeccable. And inhaled steroids? Absolutely not! I’ve never had asthma, COPD, or any such weakness. This is… unacceptable. Are you certain you haven't made a mistake? I am a healthy man, Doctor! This must be a misdiagnosis.
DOCTOR: I understand your disbelief, Antoine. Oral thrush can happen even with good hygiene. It can occur due to a variety of factors, even a temporary weakening of the immune system, or sometimes after taking antibiotics. It's not necessarily a sign of a serious underlying condition. While inhaled steroids are a common cause, they are not the only cause. Do you recall being on any antibiotics recently, even for a minor infection?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… hmm. Well, my wife insisted I take something for a… a minor toothache a few months ago. A small prescription. But it was months ago, Doctor! Surely that has nothing to do with this… this fungal affliction. Honestly, I doubt that trivial matter is relevant. I suspect this is… something else entirely. Perhaps a reaction to something I ate? Or stress? I have been rather busy lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that recent antibiotic use could be a contributing factor, even months later, as antibiotics can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth. While stress and food sensitivities can sometimes cause mouth irritation, the appearance of these firmly attached white patches points more strongly towards the thrush. I would like to prescribe you an antifungal mouthwash to help clear up the infection. It's usually very effective. Would you be open to trying that?
PATIENT: An… antifungal mouthwash. Well, I suppose it’s better than letting this… fungus fester. But I expect a full explanation of any side effects. And I’d like a guarantee that this won’t return. Honestly, Doctor, this whole experience has been most unpleasant. Very well. Prescribe your… mouthwash. But I expect a swift and complete recovery. And I'd like your assurance that this isn’t something…contagious. My wife would be most displeased.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm prescribing Nystatin oral suspension, 5ml four times a day for 14 days. Common side effects are mild nausea or stomach upset, but they are usually not severe. As for recurrence, it's possible, but unlikely if you maintain good oral hygiene. And no, it's not highly contagious. You can continue your normal activities. It can be passed through saliva, so avoid sharing utensils or kissing for the duration of the treatment, just as a precaution. I’ll also give you some instructions on good oral hygiene – rinsing your mouth with warm salt water, avoiding sugary foods, and keeping your mouth clean. Do you have any questions about the medication or the instructions?
PATIENT: Instructions… very well. Avoid sugary foods. Salt water. I suppose I can manage that. No, I don’t believe so. Just… ensure the pharmacy has this in stock. I haven't much time to waste running around. And please, Doctor, let’s not repeat this ordeal. I trust this… mouthwash will resolve the matter swiftly. Thank you. Or, as much as one can be thankful for such a… predicament. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. I’ve sent the prescription electronically to your usual pharmacy. It should be ready shortly. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
