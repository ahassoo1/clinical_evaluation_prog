DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… wanted to check things out, really. Been feelin’ okay, mostly. Thought I’d see what a check-up’s all about, ya know? It’s been a while since I had one.
DOCTOR: Right. A “check-up.” Well, that’s… commendable, I suppose. Though preventative care is always best before something is actually wrong. Still. Let's get some details. When you say “feeling okay,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, sure. Like… no big pains. Sleepin’ alright, most nights. Workin’ steady. I guess… just regular stuff. I ain’t had any trouble breathin’ or anything. I eat… okay. Not fancy, but I eat. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Regular stuff.” Vague. Very vague. Alright. Let’s try this systematically. When you say “sleeping alright,” are you waking up feeling rested?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not every time. Some nights I wake up… kinda stiff. Mostly in my back, I think. And sometimes… just feelin’ kinda tired all day, even if I slept a good eight hours. It’s hard to explain. It ain't bad tired, ya know? Just… not fully awake, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Not fully awake.” Interesting. And this stiffness… where exactly in your back?
PATIENT: Lower back, mostly. Right around… where your belt is. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a… ache. It gets worse if I bend over or lift stuff at work. We do a lot of heavy liftin’ on the ships, ya know? It usually goes away after I move around a bit, though.
DOCTOR: “Ships.” Right. Well, heavy lifting and lower back pain are… frequently correlated. Have you had any injuries to your back in the past?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I remember. Maybe pulled somethin' a long time ago, but nothin' serious. Just… a little sore for a day or two. I never went to the doctor about it. Seemed like it healed on its own. I did throw my back out a few years back, but that was from tryin' to show off at a party, not work. That was a dumb move.
DOCTOR: “Showing off at a party.” Of course. Well, regardless. Let’s move on. Do you have any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiatin’… you mean like, shootin’ pain? No, not really. Sometimes my legs feel a little… heavy at the end of the day, but that’s probably just from bein’ on my feet so much. Nothin’ sharp or burnin’ or anything like that. Just tired legs.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about bowel and bladder function?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a second. You askin’ about… goin’ to the bathroom? That feels kinda personal, Doctor. I just came in for a check-up. Is that somethin' we gotta talk about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, a complete medical assessment requires a thorough history. Changes in bowel and bladder function can indicate underlying medical issues. It’s a standard question. I assure you, it is all confidential. Are you experiencing any difficulty or changes in urination or bowel movements?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Uh… no, not really. Everything’s… regular. Like I said. Maybe… sometimes I gotta go a little more often than I used to, but nothin’ major. Could just be from drinkin’ more water, ya know? It's been hot. Honestly, I get a little embarrassed talkin’ about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's proceed with a physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. We’ll start with your back. I'll palpate the area to assess for tenderness and muscle spasm. Please inform me immediately if you experience any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Pal-what? Never heard that word before. But sure, I'll lie down. Just tell me what you're doin', alright? And if it hurts, I'll let you know. Don't worry.
DOCTOR: Palpate simply means I will feel your back. Auscultation means I am listening to your back with the stethoscope. I’m checking for any unusual sounds. Now, please lie prone – that is, on your stomach – with your arms relaxed at your sides. Alright. Now, tell me if you feel any pain when I press here… and here… Any tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: Okay, layin' flat. Uh… yeah, that spot kinda hurts. Right there. Not like a sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like I was sayin’. And when you push… yeah, it hurts a little more. It feels kinda tight too. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Tightness and tenderness in the lumbar region, consistent with muscle strain. And now, I'd like you to gently bend forward, as far as comfortable. Don’t push yourself. Alright, now backward. And finally, can you rotate your torso to each side?
PATIENT: Okay, bendin' forward… Oof. That's… that's about as far as I can go without it hurtin' too much. Feels kinda stuck, ya know? Backward… Yeah, that's not so good. Definitely tighter goin' back. And turnin’… It's hard to turn. Feels like somethin's blockin' me. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with tenderness and muscle spasm consistent with a lumbar strain. The history and physical findings suggest a musculoskeletal injury, likely exacerbated by the heavy lifting involved in your occupation. However, given your age and the persistent nature of the symptoms, a more definitive diagnosis requires imaging to rule out other potential causes. I’m going to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine. We’ll also obtain a urine sample to rule out any underlying infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray… and a pee sample? Is somethin' really wrong? I just thought I pulled a muscle. I mean… yeah, okay, I guess. If you think it’s necessary. But I really don’t like the sound of an X-ray. Is it gonna hurt? And what about the pee sample? Where do I… ya know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, the X-ray is a standard diagnostic procedure. It allows us to visualize the bones in your spine and identify any fractures, abnormalities, or other underlying issues that may be contributing to your pain. The radiation exposure is minimal. As for the urine sample, it’s a simple test to rule out infection. A nurse will provide you with a sterile container and instructions on how to collect it. It is standard procedure. I am not downplaying your discomfort, but it’s important to rule out more serious conditions. I’ll have the nurse come in to collect the sample and explain the X-ray procedure. Are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies… not that I know of. Okay, so X-ray and pee sample. Fine. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle with the X-ray. I get kinda nervous around machines. And… is this gonna cost a lot of money? My insurance ain’t the greatest.
DOCTOR: I will make a note regarding your anxiety about the X-ray. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage and deductible. The billing department can provide you with an estimate. I assure you, we will do everything we can to facilitate the process. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief with ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. Avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity. I will review the results of the X-ray and urine sample and discuss a more definitive treatment plan at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ stuff. And tellin’ the nurse to be gentle. Hopefully it’s just a pulled muscle, like I thought.
