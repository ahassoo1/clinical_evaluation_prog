DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this tiredness. Just dragging all the time. And… well, it’s embarrassing to even say, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to worry me, I suppose. It sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? I just… crave it. And it’s not like I’m out there digging in the garden or anything. I find it… in the basement, mostly. Old clay stuff. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s certainly… unusual. But we’re here to figure things out, Ms. Hardenburgh, no judgment. Eating dirt, as you put it, is something we need to explore. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this dragging sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, now. At least six, maybe more. It comes and goes, but it’s getting worse. I used to be able to push through it, you know? Get my work done, keep up with things. Now… now I just want to sit. And the dirt craving seems to happen when I'm most tired. Like, my body just… wants it. Is that even possible? It sounds utterly foolish when I say it out loud.
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s a very specific symptom, and it can be connected to underlying issues. We call this craving non-nutritive substance eating, pica, actually. It’s often associated with deficiencies. Now, when you say “getting worse,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Deficiencies? Well, that doesn't sound good, does it? Getting worse… Hmm. It used to be just an afternoon slump, maybe needing a longer nap. Now? I'm tired all the time. And it’s not just physical, you know? It’s… mental, too. Like I’m wading through mud. Hard to focus, hard to remember things. Though I do remember exactly where I found that reddish clay in the basement… which is frustrating, honestly! I should be remembering my grocery list, not the location of dirt. It’s interfering with my work, definitely. I've had to call out a couple times.
DOCTOR: Right. So, both physical and mental exhaustion, worsening over several months. And it's impacting your work. Okay. Let's talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Don’t tell me I’m not eating enough greens or something. I eat… fine, I suppose. Breakfast is usually toast with a little jam. Lunch is a sandwich, sometimes soup. Dinner… depends. Leftovers, usually. Or something simple, like pasta. I don't really cook anymore. Too tired, you see. And I drink plenty of water. No sugary drinks, I don’t like them. I don’t take any vitamins. Never really thought I needed them. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, relatively standard, though perhaps lacking in variety. No vitamins, and not a lot of detailed nutrient intake. We’ll need to explore that further. Now, let’s go back to the… clay. How much would you say you're consuming in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s not a huge amount, truly. Maybe a couple of spoonfuls a day when I'm really bad. Sometimes less, sometimes… a little more. It's hard to say exactly. I just… take a bit, chew it, and it… helps? Not a lot, but it’s… soothing. I know it’s ridiculous, but it’s like a… weight lifted. I mostly get it from this old bucket in the basement, been there for ages. My husband used to… well, never mind. He’s gone now. It’s just… there. And when I feel weak, I go down and get some. .
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of spoonfuls when feeling weak. We need to figure out why you’re feeling weak, Ms. Hardenburgh. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and the craving?
