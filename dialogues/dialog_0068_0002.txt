DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks, I think. Not working so good, you see? It’s hard to… push it out. Like it’s stuck. Not painful, just… difficult. Been happening a little while now, I guess. I forget how long exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "waterworks"… difficulty with urination. And you say it's been going on for a little while. Can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Hmm. Maybe a month? Two months? Time just… slips away, you know? It's not all the time, not like I can't go at all. Just… takes me a long time, and I have to… strain a bit. And sometimes it feels like it doesn't all come out, if that makes sense. It’s a funny thing to talk about, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is, but these things are important, Ms. Stoffregen. Don't worry, we'll figure it out. So, a month or two of difficulty… needing to strain, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Stream…? Oh, you mean when it… comes out? Hmm. I… think it's not as strong as it used to be. Not a big rush, you know? More of a… trickle. But I’m a very old woman, Doctor. Maybe it’s just… old age. I don’t know. Does that make sense? I used to be able to… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased stream strength. That's helpful. And you're right, these things can change with age. But we still want to understand what’s happening. Do you experience any burning or discomfort while you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning…? No, no burning. Not at all. It doesn’t hurt, like. Just… frustrating. Like trying to squeeze water out of a nearly empty sponge. Does that make sense? I feel like I have to… work at it. And then I worry I haven't gotten everything out. It's just a little worry, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no burning. Just difficulty and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any changes in how often you need to go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. I… I go when I need to, I suppose. Not more than usual, maybe? I do get up at night sometimes, a couple of times. Always have, really. Even when I was younger. But maybe it’s a little more now? It’s hard to tell, you see. My husband usually doesn't notice… and I try not to bother him. He's getting on a bit, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, getting up a couple of times at night… We should probably take a quick look at your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see here you have Medicare… Do you have a list of medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Medicare. Good insurance. Medications… hmm. Let me think. Just a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. And sometimes something for my arthritis, when it flares up. I keep them in a little box in the kitchen. My daughter helps me with them, mostly. I forget what they’re called. Just… little white ones and some pink ones, I think. Oh, and sometimes a pain reliever when my hip bothers me. I don’t take them every day, though. Really, not much, Doctor. I try to stay strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, something for arthritis as needed, and pain reliever occasionally. We'll need to get a precise list for the record, but that's a start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a brief neurological check, and potentially checking a sample of your urine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a check-up? Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don't mind. Just… don’t poke too hard, alright? My old bones are a bit brittle. A urine sample… yes, I can do that. Where should I…? Do I just… go to the bathroom?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be very gentle. And yes, please just go to the bathroom now and collect a sample. There's a cup in there, and instructions on the counter. Take your time. I'll be right outside when you're finished.
PATIENT: Alright. A bathroom break it is. Funny how simple things get harder when you get old, isn't it? I'll be back when I'm done.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be right here.
