DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t have a lot of time for small talk. It’s my stomach. Been…well, it’s been awful. Just constantly running to the bathroom. They sent me over here after… everything else didn’t work. Honestly, I’m just tired of dealing with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I appreciate you being direct with me. It sounds very unpleasant to be dealing with this ongoing issue. “Everything else” – could you elaborate on what treatments or tests you’ve already tried?
PATIENT: Ugh, where do I even begin? First, there was…something the first doctor gave me. Pink stuff. Didn't do a thing. Then they took…samples. You know. And another doctor wanted me to try a different…powder. It just made it worse, honestly. I can’t remember all the names, and frankly, I don’t care. It’s been going on for weeks. Is that what you need to know? Weeks of this!
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Woodring. It sounds like you’ve been through quite a bit already. Weeks of this is significant. When did this start exactly, if you can recall?
PATIENT: Honestly? It started right after… well, after my husband passed. Everything just…changed. I don’t know if it’s related, but it was fine before that. It started maybe a week or so after the funeral? It’s all a blur, to be honest. Is it really necessary to go over every single detail? It’s just…diarrhea. Bad diarrhea.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult to discuss, and I apologize for pressing for details. It's perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. It is important, though, to try and understand the timeline and any potential triggers. The fact that this started around the time of your husband’s passing is very relevant, Ms. Woodring. Stress and grief can absolutely manifest physically. So, to clarify, it began roughly a week after the funeral with diarrhea. Has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Mostly. There’s maybe a few hours here and there where it calms down, but then it’s back. Worse than before. And I’m not just…going. It’s cramping, and… it’s embarrassing to even talk about. Look, I just want something to stop it. I have things to do, you know? I don’t have time to sit on the toilet all day.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Woodring. Constant diarrhea and cramping sounds very debilitating, and it’s completely reasonable that you want relief and to get back to your life. Let’s talk a bit more about the diarrhea itself. Can you describe it?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want to know, the color? It’s… watery. And a lot of it. Sometimes there's… undigested food. Honestly, I don't really look at it. I just know it's bad. And it smells awful, if that’s what you’re asking. Is this really necessary? I mean, I told you it’s diarrhea. What more do you need to know?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Ms. Woodring. It is important, and I apologize if I'm being insensitive. Knowing details about the diarrhea – color, consistency, presence of blood or mucus – helps me narrow down the possibilities. I’m not trying to be unpleasant, just thorough. Since you’re uncomfortable describing it in detail, let’s move on for now. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: No. Definitely not. Just…water. And sometimes bits of whatever I ate. And it smells…awful. Look, can we just get to the part where you give me something to fix it? I really don't need to dissect my…bathroom habits. I have a business to run, you know. People are waiting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I want to assure you I'm not trying to delay getting you relief. I want to get to that point as quickly as possible, but it's important to gather enough information to ensure I recommend the most appropriate treatment. Okay, let's shift gears. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain, yes. Lots of it. Cramping, mostly. Like…someone’s twisting my insides. Nausea sometimes, but I haven’t actually thrown up. No fever. And I'm not exactly hungry, but I haven't been actively sick, if that makes sense. Look, I just want this to stop. I'm exhausted. It's been weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal cramping and nausea, no fever or vomiting. That’s helpful. And you mentioned exhaustion. Has this diarrhea impacted your energy levels significantly?
PATIENT: Impacted my energy levels? Are you kidding me? I barely have the energy to get out of bed some days. I'm constantly running back and forth, and I haven't slept through the night in weeks. I'm just…drained. It’s ridiculous. I'm a painter, Doc. I need to be strong and steady. I can’t be running to the bathroom every ten minutes. It’s affecting my work. And frankly, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Woodring. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your life, both physically and professionally. That level of exhaustion is concerning, and the disruption to your work is understandably frustrating. Now, let's quickly go over some general medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat everything. Take whatever they give me. Honestly, I don't have time for allergies. Look, can we please move this along? I'm starting to get a headache just talking about all this. It’s my stomach, I’ve told you everything. Can’t you just give me something? Anything?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I assure you I am trying to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more quick questions. Have you been taking any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. I don’t take anything. I avoid doctors if I can. Honestly, I just want this to be over with. I’ve already wasted half the day here. I have a job to get back to. Can you just… look at me and decide what to give me? I trust your judgement. Just… something to make it stop. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. No allergies, no current medications. I appreciate your trust. Given your history, the stress surrounding your husband's passing, and the ongoing diarrhea without fever or blood, it sounds like this could be related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, potentially triggered by the stress. It’s also possible there’s an underlying infection we need to rule out, though the lack of fever makes that less likely. I’d like to start with a mild anti-diarrheal medication, Loperamide, to help control the symptoms. We can also start with a probiotic to help restore the balance of bacteria in your gut. However, given the duration of this issue and the impact on your energy levels, I would also like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a stool sample to rule out any infection or inflammation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get me something to stop it now. The blood work… fine. Do what you need to do. I just… I just want to feel normal again. The pill sounds good. Anything. Just give it to me. And can you write me a note for work? I'm going to need to explain why I was gone all day. A very vague note. Just something.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I completely understand. I’ll order the blood work and write you a prescription for Loperamide. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully, and if it doesn’t improve within 2-3 days, or if you develop a fever, abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please contact the clinic immediately. Here’s the prescription and a note for your work explaining that you were seen for a medical issue and need to take some time to recover. It’s intentionally vague to protect your privacy. The lab is just down the hall. You can give them this form, and they’ll take the samples. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we can discuss them when they are available, typically within a few days. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I hope this works. Honestly, I’m just tired. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Woodring. I understand your fatigue, and I sincerely hope this provides some relief. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. .
