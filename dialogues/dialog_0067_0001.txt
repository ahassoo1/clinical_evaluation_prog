DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's August 2nd. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be quite frank, it’s the cigarettes. I’ve been… well, a long time with them, and I think it’s time I try to do something about it. I understand you can help with that?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I can certainly help you explore options to quit smoking. It's wonderful that you've decided to address this, Mr. Knoch – it’s one of the best things you can do for your health. To start, could you tell me a bit more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I started when I was… oh, seventeen, I believe. Back in Lithuania, it was… commonplace, you see. Everyone smoked. Started with just a few a day, after work, mostly. Then… well, it grew. For a good many years, it was a pack a day, easy. Now… now it's probably closer to three-quarters of a pack. Mostly these days after meals, and when I’m… thinking. It helps me think, you see. I’ve tried to stop a few times, years ago, but… it didn’t stick.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Knoch. It sounds like a very long and established habit. And it's completely understandable that it’s difficult to break, especially when it's linked to times of relaxation or concentration. You mentioned you tried to quit a few times before. Do you remember what methods you used then?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. The first time, it was simply… willpower. A foolish notion, really. Just decided to stop. That lasted… three days, perhaps. Then I tried those patches, some years later. The sticky ones. They made me feel quite unwell, actually. Nauseous, and… jittery. I couldn't sleep. After that, I believe I tried… chewing gum? Something with nicotine, to replace it. That didn’t fare much better. It just felt… unsatisfying. Like a poor substitute, you see. It was a long time ago, though. Perhaps things are different now?
DOCTOR: You’re right to wonder if things are different now. There have been many advances in smoking cessation treatments. The patches and gum are still available, but there are also medications specifically designed to help with the cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Before we discuss those, let’s get a clearer picture of your overall health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms currently – cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A cough, yes, occasionally. Not a terrible one, more of a… a tickle, really. Especially in the mornings. And sometimes, when I walk up hills… I do get a little breathless, but I attribute that to my age, mostly. I don’t wheeze, not that I’ve noticed. And no chest pain, thankfully. Though… I do feel a bit tired more easily these days, but again, that could just be getting older, you see. Seventy-four years takes its toll.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And you're right, those symptoms can certainly be related to age. It’s helpful to rule things out though, to ensure we're addressing everything appropriately. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been… reasonably healthy, I believe. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, for the usual check-ups, but they never mentioned anything… serious. My blood pressure has been… a little high, on occasion, but nothing that required medication, you see. Just watching my salt intake, they said. And no diabetes, no heart problems. I lead a… quiet life, mostly. Not much stress, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear. And a quiet life can be very beneficial. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see... yes, actually. Years ago, I had my appendix removed. A rather unpleasant experience, as I recall. And… oh, a minor operation on my knee, some years after that, just to tidy things up, the doctor said. It was quite a small thing, really. Nothing major. Everything healed well, you see. That was… perhaps twenty years ago now. Apart from those two, no, nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… it’s a bit complicated, you see. My wife passed away some years ago, and I don't have any children. I have a sister, living in Vilnius, but we don't see each other often. She’s a bit… frail, these days. As for medical history, my father… he smoked, as well. All his life, practically. He developed… problems with his lungs, eventually. That’s… one of the reasons I’m trying to stop, you see. I don't want the same fate. My mother, she was quite healthy, thankfully. No smoking, no major illnesses.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's very insightful of you to connect your decision to quit to your father's experience, Mr. Knoch. It’s a good motivator. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, the doctor recommended it, you see. Living in a colder climate, not enough sunlight. But that’s it. Nothing else. No pills, no creams, no nothing. I try to avoid them if possible, you see. Prefer a natural approach, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Mr. Knoch. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your oxygen levels. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. I understand it’s important to get a proper assessment, you see. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Just… try not to startle me, if possible. Old reflexes, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/85. We can monitor that. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, particularly on the left side. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is within the normal range, but slightly lower than ideal. I also notice some mild discoloration of your fingers, consistent with long-term smoking. Based on what you've told me and what I've heard today, it's clear that smoking has had an effect on your respiratory system. The wheezing and lower oxygen saturation are things we want to address. The good news is, quitting now can help to improve these things.
PATIENT: That doesn’t surprise me, Doctor. I’ve felt it, you see. A tightness in my chest sometimes, especially when it’s cold. I suppose I’ve been ignoring it, hoping it would go away. But it’s good to have it confirmed. So… what are my options, exactly? What can you do to help me stop this… habit? I’m willing to try, you see. I truly am. I just… don’t want to go through all that discomfort again, with the patches and the gum. Is there something else?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about repeating past experiences with the patches and gum, Mr. Knoch. Fortunately, there are several other options available now. There are a few medications specifically designed to help with nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion and Varenicline are two common choices. Bupropion is an antidepressant that can reduce cravings, while Varenicline works by blocking the effects of nicotine. Both require a prescription, and we would need to discuss potential side effects to see if they are right for you. Another option is behavioral therapy. This involves working with a counselor to develop coping strategies and address the psychological aspects of addiction. We can provide a referral to a qualified therapist. Finally, there are over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies like lozenges and inhalers, which might be a better tolerated option than the patches. I think, given your history, starting with behavioral therapy and possibly adding a nicotine lozenge might be a good approach. What do you think?
PATIENT: Hmm… behavioral therapy… that sounds… sensible, actually. Addressing the… the root of the problem, you see. The habit, the comfort… It's not just the nicotine, is it? It's the routine, the feeling… And the lozenges… if they're less intrusive than the patches, I’m willing to try them. The patches made me feel quite ill, as I said. So, a counselor and the lozenges… Yes, that sounds like a good starting point. Do you have a list of counselors you recommend? And… are the lozenges readily available? At a pharmacy, perhaps? I live alone, you see, so I’d need to be able to get them myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I have a list of qualified counselors in the area who specialize in smoking cessation. Here you are. It includes their contact information and a brief description of their approach. And yes, nicotine lozenges are readily available at most pharmacies without a prescription. They come in different strengths, so you might need to experiment to find the one that works best for you. I recommend starting with the lowest dose and gradually increasing it if needed. I also want to give you some information about potential side effects and warning signs. It's important to be aware of them and to contact me if you experience anything concerning. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Does that sound good to you, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. A list of counselors, the lozenges, the information pamphlet… and a follow-up appointment. It's good to know I’m not on my own with this, you see. Two weeks… Yes, that gives me time to get started, to try the lozenges and perhaps make an appointment with a counselor. I will read the pamphlet carefully. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. I appreciate your patience and… understanding. I’m ready to give this a try. I truly am.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. I’m glad I could help. Remember, quitting smoking is a journey, and there will be challenges along the way. But you’ve already taken the first and most important step – deciding to make a change. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please call the office if you have any questions or need to reschedule. I wish you the best of luck, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
