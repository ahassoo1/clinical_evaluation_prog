DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... my heart, it feels... funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping, not beating steady. That’s why I come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing a sensation of your heart fluttering or beating irregularly. That’s certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: When it happen? Hmm... not always the same. Sometimes when I work, you know, with the machines. Sometimes just when I sit. Not when I sleep, never when I sleep. It just... starts. And stops. Like a light switch.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it happens both during activity, like when you’re working with machines, and at rest when you’re simply sitting. And importantly, it doesn’t happen when you're asleep. That’s helpful information. When this “starts,” how long does it typically last?
PATIENT: Not long. Maybe... five minutes? Sometimes less. Never more than ten, I think. And it not every day. Maybe two, three times a week? Sometimes not for a whole week. It hard to say, Doctor. I don’t keep track.
DOCTOR: I understand it's difficult to keep track. A few times a week, lasting a few minutes at a time – that gives us a starting point. And it’s good to know it's not constant. Besides the fluttering sensation, do you experience any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Uh... sometimes I feel a little... weak. Like I could fall. But not always. And maybe... a little dizzy. But not spinning dizzy, just... light. Like I need to sit down quick. That’s all, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed some weakness and a feeling of lightheadedness accompanying these episodes. That’s important. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never before. This is new. Maybe… one year ago, I felt my heart beat fast after I lift very heavy thing at work. But not like this. This is different. More… flapping. Not just fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this “flapping” sensation is a new experience, distinct from a single episode of a fast heartbeat about a year ago. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I healthy. I work hard, I eat good food. No problems. My wife, she always says I work too much, but… no problems. No doctor visits for many years. Just… this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And it’s helpful to know you haven't been seeing a doctor regularly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never surgery. Never hospital. Not even for a broken bone. I careful. My father, he was always telling me, "Be careful, Philipp!" I listen to my father. He good man.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm... my father, he had high blood pressure, I think. My mother, she… she had stomach problems. Nothing with the heart, I don’t think. My brother, he okay. Works in the city. No problems. Not much heart trouble in my family, I think. Just… regular things. Old age things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your father and some stomach problems in your mother, but no significant heart conditions that you’re aware of. That’s good information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. My wife, she always trying to give me more vegetables, but I eat anything. No problems. I like food. Especially spicy food. But no allergies, Doctor. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And currently, are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like pills. My wife, she give me vitamin C sometimes when I sick, but I don't take it regular. Just when I feel bad. But I not taking anything now. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're not currently taking any medications. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoke. No drink. No… other things. I work hard, I come home to my wife. That's it. No bad habits. My father always say, “Hard work is the best thing.” I listen to my father.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. A very healthy lifestyle, it sounds like. Okay, Mr. Puder, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your heart and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That okay. Whatever you need. I want to know what is wrong with my heart. So, check everything. That good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the table, and I'll begin the exam. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not critically high. Your pulse is 78 and regular at rest. I’m listening to your heart now… I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm, but it’s subtle. It’s difficult to assess when you're at rest, as it seems to come and go. Your lungs sound clear. I'm going to have you stand up slowly. How do you feel?
PATIENT: Okay. I feel… okay. A little dizzy, maybe. Like a light head. But not bad. I stand up slow like you say. But yes, a little dizzy. Like I need to hold on to something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. You experience a slight lightheadedness when standing, which could be related to the irregular rhythm we're hearing. To get a clearer picture of what's happening with your heart, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG. This is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us identify the cause of the irregular rhythm. I also want to order a blood test to check your thyroid levels and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. EKG and blood test. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what is wrong. So, do the tests. I trust you. When we do the tests? Now?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do the EKG right here in the office. It only takes a few minutes. As for the blood test, we'll need to draw some blood. We can do that right after the EKG. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Alright, Mr. Puder, that’s all done. Now we’ll just get the blood drawn. After the nurse draws your blood, she'll give you instructions on aftercare. It's important to drink plenty of fluids today. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available, usually within a few days. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No questions, Doctor. Just… when I get the results? How long? And… what if it is bad? Will I need… surgery? I worry a little. My wife, she worries too.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable to be worried. It’s good you’re thinking about this. Typically, the results come back within 3-5 business days. Once I have them, my staff will call to schedule a follow-up appointment. As for what if it is “bad,” it's too early to say. Many irregular heart rhythms are benign and don't require treatment. However, if we find something concerning, we'll discuss all your options, which could include medication, lifestyle changes, or, in some cases, a referral to a cardiologist to discuss further intervention. Surgery is rarely the first step. We will proceed step-by-step and I will explain everything to you thoroughly. For now, let’s focus on getting the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That good. Thank you. You explain very good. I feel… less worry now. Just wait for the phone call. And… I try not to worry my wife too much. She already worry a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad I could ease some of your concerns. It sounds like you're a very caring husband. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and we’ll talk soon.
