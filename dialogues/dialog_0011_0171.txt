DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's August 2nd, 2025. I see here you’re 40 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, forty. It's... the nails. They just look funny. Not like they used to, you know? I don’t… remember when they started. A while, I think. I just noticed. They’re not… pretty.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve noticed changes in your nails, and they aren’t aesthetically pleasing as they once were. Could you describe those changes to me?
PATIENT: Well… they’re kinda… thick. And the color is… off. Not a nice pink, more… yellowish. And one of them… it's got little lines in it. Like cracks, almost. It’s just… not right. I don't do much with them, if that matters. No fancy polish or anything. Just… regular nails. Or, used to be regular.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that description, Ms. Thut. Thickening, a yellowish discoloration, and ridging on at least one nail. And you haven’t been using any nail products recently – no polish, acrylics, or gels?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never have. Too much trouble, all that. I just… wash my hands. A lot, maybe? I don’t know. I clean a lot. My mama always said clean is good. And I… work with ears, you know? Gotta be clean for that. Though… I don't see how that would change my nails.
DOCTOR: You mentioned you work with ears. Could you tell me a bit more about your profession?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I’m an audiologist. I… help people hear. I check their ears, fit them with hearing aids. That sort of thing. It's… quiet work, mostly. But you gotta be careful, you know? Germs and everything. I don't remember exactly when I started doing it, though. A long time, I guess. It’s…important work. People need to hear. But it's not got anything to do with my nails! Are you gonna fix them or what?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining your profession, Ms. Thut. And you are right to ask about fixing them; we'll certainly work towards that. Understanding your work is helpful, as it can give us clues. Frequent handwashing, while excellent for hygiene, could contribute, though it sounds like we need to explore other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you've noticed any pain, swelling, or redness around your nails or cuticles?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little… achy sometimes? But I just thought that was my hands. I use them a lot. Swelling… no, I don’t think so. And redness… maybe a little around the edges, but that could just be from the water, I guess. I do dishes a lot, you know. Plain water. Nothing fancy. I really don’t understand why my nails are doing this. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: No pain, mild achiness, and possible redness around the edges, which you attribute to frequent dishwashing. Thank you. And it's perfectly understandable to be concerned about changes you've noticed. Now, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, psoriasis, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… I don’t really… keep track of that sort of thing. Let me think… Mama always said I was healthy, mostly. No… I don’t think I have anything. Maybe a little high blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but that was… a long time ago. And I take a water pill for it, sometimes. I don’t remember the name. It's… small and white. And I get Medicare, if that matters. I definitely don't have any of those fancy things you said… psoriasis, whatever it was. Just normal stuff. I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. So, a history of elevated blood pressure in the past, currently managed with a water pill—we’ll work to identify that medication name shortly—and no known history of psoriasis or thyroid problems. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was little. That’s about it, I think. And… no, I haven't been in the hospital. Not since I was a baby, maybe? Mama took me when I was born, of course. But nothing… recent. I mostly just stay home and… work. And clean. I'm a pretty healthy person, really. This nail thing is just… strange. It’s not like me. Are you sure you can fix it? It's kinda ruining my whole look, you know? People notice.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. I understand your concern about your appearance, Ms. Thut. We'll do everything we can to determine the cause and find a solution. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, goodness. That’s… hard. Mama and Papa are both… gone now. And I didn’t really… talk to a lot of family. They mostly kept to themselves. Papa… he had a bad heart, I think. He always coughed a lot. And Mama… she just… got old. That's all I really know. They didn't really talk about… illnesses or anything. Just… things. I don’t think they had any of those… fancy diseases. Mostly just… normal old age. Is this helping? I feel like I'm not being very useful. I just want my nails to look normal again.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Thut. It’s perfectly understandable that you don’t have detailed family history information. A history of heart issues in your father is helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your current medications. You mentioned a water pill. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just the water pill, I think. It's small and white, like I said. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D. The doctor told me I was low. It’s a little gummy bear. That’s all, really. I don’t really like taking pills. They make me feel funny. And… I don’t really believe in all those supplements. Just the vitamin D, sometimes. For the bones, the doctor said. But mostly, nothing. I'm a pretty simple person. I just want this nail thing to go away. It's… distracting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Thut. So, you're currently taking a water pill for blood pressure and occasional Vitamin D. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on with your nails, I'd like to take a look at them. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Please, look! Maybe you can see something I can't. They just look… wrong. And they're starting to bother me, you know? It feels like… little ridges when I clean. Please, look at them, doctor. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I'm taking a closer look now. I notice the thickening you described, and the yellowish discoloration is present in all nails. The ridging is most pronounced on the left index finger. The nail beds appear normal in color, and there’s no significant inflammation or pitting. There is some mild onycholysis—slight separation of the nail from the nail bed—on the right thumb. It doesn't appear to be painful to the touch. Based on what I see, the appearance is suggestive of a fungal infection, potentially onychomycosis. However, other possibilities exist, such as psoriasis or even chronic exposure to irritants. To confirm the diagnosis, we'll need to perform a nail sampling for laboratory testing. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fungal… what? Is that… bad? And on-i-co… something? Oh dear. Irritants? Like… dish soap? But I just use regular soap! I don’t like all those chemicals. Lab testing? Does that mean… you’re gonna take a piece of my nail? Oh, goodness. I don't know, doctor. That sounds… unpleasant. Is there any other way? I really don't want you to… cut my nail. It’s bad enough that it looks funny. Cutting it will just make it worse! Can’t you just… give me something to put on it? Like a cream or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Thut. Onychomycosis is the medical term for a fungal nail infection. It’s common, and while it’s not immediately dangerous, it can be persistent and uncomfortable. The laboratory testing involves taking a small scraping from underneath the nail to identify if a fungus is present. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure—similar to filing your nails. A topical cream is an option, but unfortunately, they often don't penetrate the nail thick enough to be effective, especially in cases like yours. Oral medication is typically more successful, but that would require a confirmed diagnosis first. To clarify, we’re not talking about cutting the entire nail. Just a small scraping for testing. It's the best way to determine the cause of the changes you're experiencing and guide the most appropriate treatment. Would you be willing to proceed with the sampling, then we can discuss all the treatment options?
PATIENT: Oh… just a scraping? Not the whole nail? That’s… better. Still doesn’t sound very pleasant, but… better. And you have to know what it is before you can give me something to fix it, right? I guess… alright. Yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. And tell me what you find. I really want this to go away. I just want my normal nails back. Are you sure you can fix it, doctor? I don't want to go through all this for nothing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. Just a small scraping, and I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concern, and I will certainly do my best to find a solution for you. I'll prepare the necessary materials now. It will only take a few minutes. Afterwards, we will send the sample to the lab, and the results should be available in about a week. Once we have those results, we can discuss the most effective treatment options, and I’ll explain everything in detail. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A week… I can wait a week. As long as you promise to fix it. And explain everything. I don't understand a lot of the… fancy words you use. Just tell me what I need to do, okay? And… be gentle. Please. I'm trusting you, doctor. Just fix my nails.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your trust, Ms. Thut, and I will absolutely do my best. I promise to explain everything clearly and keep you informed every step of the way. I'll use plain language, and you can always ask me to repeat or clarify anything you don't understand. Now, if you could just relax your hand… I’m going to gently file a small portion of the nail on your left thumb, and then collect a tiny scraping for testing. It might feel a little pressure, but shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. That’s all done. Just keep that bandage clean and dry for the next 24 hours. We'll send this sample to the lab, and I expect the results within about a week. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
