DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Look, I don't have all day. I’m here because… I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens. No complications, you understand? I’m not getting any younger, and frankly, I’d like to avoid a drawn-out process.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. You’d like to explore options for conceiving and ensure a healthy pregnancy… and you're concerned about time. Okay. To start, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, it’s…fine. I’ve never had anything serious. Divorced, which probably doesn’t matter, and I have Medicare. I go to the dentist, I get my flu shot. Is that what you need? Look, I’m a healthy woman. I eat reasonably well, I don't smoke, and I certainly don't drink. What specifically are you trying to find out? I just want to know if there’s anything wrong with me preventing this from happening.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know you're generally healthy, yes. And no, I don’t need a life story. Just some basics to get a clearer picture. Have you ever been pregnant before, Ms. Shteynberg?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, it's a little insulting you even ask. Do I look like someone who’s had children? I wouldn’t be here if I had a perfectly good family already, would I? It's rather obvious, isn't it? Now, are we going to actually do something, or are you just going to ask me irrelevant questions?
DOCTOR: Apologies, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your frustration. It's important to rule out any potential factors. Let’s move on then. Do you have any allergies to medications, or have you had any serious reactions to any medications in the past?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I take nothing. I believe in letting the body heal itself. Though, I had a bad reaction to a penicillin when I was a child…a very long time ago. A rash, mostly. Nothing life-threatening. It's hardly relevant now, is it? Honestly, doctor, you're asking me about things that happened sixty years ago! Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just filling out paperwork?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough… and it is helpful to have a complete picture, even things from a long time ago… have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Once. When I broke my wrist falling off a bicycle – quite a while ago, obviously. And a tonsillectomy when I was…very young. A simple procedure. No complications. Look, I’m a very robust woman. I’m not frail. I don’t get sick. Is there a test you can just give me to prove I’m perfectly capable of having a baby? I’m wasting my afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries or hospitalizations… Good. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What does that even mean? My mother… she lived a long life. She didn’t have any…problems, as far as I know. My father was…healthy. They both smoked, unfortunately. And drank. It was a different time. Is that what you want to know? Look, are you expecting me to list every aunt and uncle and their…ailments? Because I haven’t got the time. I want to know if I have a problem. Not my relatives.
DOCTOR: Understanding family history can sometimes point to potential risks, Ms. Shteynberg, but it sounds like there wasn't a lot of significant medical history on either side. Okay. Let's switch gears slightly. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No! I told you, I take nothing. Absolutely nothing. I believe in natural remedies. And frankly, I don't trust those pharmaceutical companies. So no, I am not popping pills like some…some hypochondriac. Are we finished yet? I'm starting to feel quite faint just thinking about all these pointless questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your vital signs and a general assessment. It will help us get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Finally. A test. Yes, get on with it. Though I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. I eat well, I exercise—walk the dog, mostly—and I don’t have any…ailments. But fine, do your exam. Just don’t keep me all afternoon. And I hope you’ve sanitized everything. I don't trust germs.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat here. I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Everything seems within normal limits so far. I'd like to do a pelvic exam now, to assess your reproductive organs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Honestly. Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, everything seems fine. I feel perfectly…functional. But…fine. If you insist. Just be quick about it, please. And I expect you to be gentle. I haven't had one in…well, a very long time. And I hope you have sterile equipment. I really don't want any…infections. Do you at least have a paper gown?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Here’s a gown for you. We always use sterile equipment. Please disrobe from the waist down and lie on the examination table. I’ll explain everything as I go. Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Uterus feels normal in size and position. Ovaries are normal to palpation. No masses or tenderness noted. Cervix is intact, no visible lesions. Everything appears normal on initial examination as well. I’m going to order some blood tests, just to get a more comprehensive picture of your hormone levels and overall health. We'll check your FSH, LH, estradiol, and a complete blood count. It will also give us a baseline should we need it later. Do you have any concerns about that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Fine. As long as it doesn't take forever to get the results. I have things to do, you know. Hormones, you say? Is something wrong with my hormones? I feel perfectly…normal. Though, I have been feeling a little tired lately. But that's probably just…age. Just get it over with. And can you tell me when I can expect the results? I don't want to be calling every five minutes.
DOCTOR: The results usually take 3-5 business days. We'll call you as soon as they are available. While we are waiting for those results, I also recommend a semen analysis for your partner. It is important to assess both sides of the equation. Do you think your partner would be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A semen analysis? Honestly, doctor, that's a bit much, don’t you think? He’s perfectly healthy. We’ve been…active for years. It's hardly necessary. And frankly, it's a bit insulting to even suggest. But…fine. I suppose I can ask him. But I’m quite certain it will be a waste of time. Is there a form I need to take to him? And can you please explain what it involves? I don't want him getting the wrong idea. This is all rather…humiliating.
DOCTOR: Here’s a form with instructions. It simply requires a sample to be collected at a lab. The lab will provide a private room. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg. It's simply to rule out any potential factors. And yes, it's important to do both to ensure that we have a complete picture. In the meantime, I recommend starting a daily prenatal vitamin with folic acid. It's always a good idea, even before conception. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available, to discuss the findings and next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Prenatal vitamins, semen analysis… it’s all a bit much. But I suppose if you insist. Just hurry up with the results, doctor. I haven't got all day. And please, send me the form electronically. I don’t do paper. Now, can I go? I have errands to run, and I’m starting to feel quite drained. This has been… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I'll have the electronic form sent to your email address immediately. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Shteynberg. We’ll be in touch soon.
