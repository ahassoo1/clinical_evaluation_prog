DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I feel…a bit worn out. I’m getting on in years, you see, and I just want to feel a little more like myself again. I was hoping for a sort of…reset, if that makes any sense. A little jumpstart to get my health back on track. I’ve been a kindergarten and elementary school teacher for many years, and it takes a lot out of a person.
DOCTOR: A “reset,” alright. I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. Eighty-seven years young is quite a milestone – teaching little ones is exhausting work! When you say “worn out,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, it is, Doctor, it truly is. And thank you for saying so. Well…it’s not one thing, exactly. I tire easily, even with just a little walking. And my memory isn't what it used to be, though I wouldn't say it's bad. Just…not as sharp. And I don’t have the energy I once did for my garden, which is a real shame. I used to spend hours out there. It’s just…a general feeling of being less…vibrant, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. “Less vibrant” is a good way to put it. So, fatigue, some memory concerns, and decreased energy. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been…gradual. Perhaps over the last year or so? Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. I suppose it started when the weather warmed up last spring, and I realized I wasn’t quite up to all my usual gardening. And then I started forgetting little things – where I put my glasses, mostly. Nothing major, but enough to make me think, “Now what was that all about?”
DOCTOR: Alright, gradual onset over the last year. And it seems to be impacting your daily activities – gardening, remembering where you put things. Do you find this fatigue is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days I feel quite alright, especially if I’ve had a good night’s sleep. But then other days…just getting out of bed feels like a chore. And it’s worse in the afternoons, usually. I tend to nap a bit after lunch, which I never used to do. It’s not a long nap, maybe an hour or so, but…well, I shouldn’t need a nap, should I? Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Fatigue that fluctuates, worse in the afternoons, requiring a nap. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think. My husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure, but I never did. I had a touch of arthritis in my knees a few years back, but it’s managed with some cream the doctor gave me. Other than that…no, I don’t think so. I've been very fortunate, health-wise, all my life, really. I've always tried to eat well and stay active, as much as I could. I had regular check-ups with Dr. Ramirez before he retired, but I haven’t seen a doctor in a while, to be honest. Perhaps a year or two. I should have kept better track, I suppose. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have that information, yes. Arthritis is good to know. And it's good you've generally been healthy. A year or two since your last check-up…okay. Now, any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Not a one. And I’ve only been in the hospital once, when I was a little girl with a bad case of the measles. That was a long time ago, of course! My mother always said I was a sturdy child. And I’ve been lucky enough to stay that way, more or less, all these years. I’ve always prided myself on being independent and able to take care of myself. That’s why this feeling of being…worn down is so unsettling, you see. It’s not like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, one childhood hospital stay for measles. Good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. Well, my husband passed away five years ago, as I mentioned. We didn't have any children, unfortunately. He had two brothers, both of whom are also gone now. And I have a niece, my sister’s daughter, who lives on Guam. We keep in touch, but I haven't seen her in a few years. As for medical history... I believe my mother had some trouble with her heart when she was older, but I don’t know the specifics. And my father was generally healthy, like myself. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at remembering these things, I'm afraid. I apologize.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. McNabb, don’t apologize. You’re doing just fine. A history of heart trouble in your mother is good to note. And no known allergies or medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had any trouble with that. And no medications, either. I don’t take anything regularly. Just the arthritis cream when my knees are acting up, but that’s it. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can, you see. I always thought it was better to just…tough it out, if possible. But I’m starting to think perhaps I should have listened to my body a little more closely. This feeling isn’t going away, and I do want to get back to my garden. It's just…well, I'm not sure what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies, no medications. We’ve covered quite a bit. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I suppose I should have come in sooner, but I didn't want to bother you with something that I thought might just be…old age. But it’s been going on long enough that I decided it was time to get it checked out. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just have a seat here. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Then we’ll do a quick neurological assessment. This won't take long. Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 85. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear. Ears and throat look normal. Neurological exam is…within normal limits, though your reflexes are a little slower than I'd expect. I'm also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. These findings are…not alarming, but they do warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Further investigation? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? What sort of investigation are we talking about, Doctor? Is it something serious? I must admit, I’m a little worried now. I just wanted a little “reset,” not…a whole lot of tests and worry. I really do hope it’s nothing too serious. My knees are already bothering me enough, and I wouldn't want to add anything else to the list. Is there anything specific you’re concerned about? Perhaps my heart?
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, I understand your concern. It’s not necessarily serious, but it's important to rule things out. The elevated blood pressure, diminished heart sounds, and mild swelling in your ankles could indicate several things - including, potentially, early signs of heart failure. The slower reflexes could suggest a vitamin deficiency or early cognitive changes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid test, and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and an echocardiogram to visualize your heart’s structure and function. Finally, a urine analysis would be helpful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s…a lot of tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid test, vitamin B12, an EKG and an echocardiogram? And a urine analysis, too? It sounds rather…extensive, doesn’t it? I suppose if you think it's necessary…but I must admit, I’m a little overwhelmed. It’s a lot to take in. Is there anything…anything at all…we could do first? Perhaps just the blood work? I’m not sure I’m up for all of that, Doctor. And frankly, the thought of an echocardiogram sounds…frightening. Is it painful? I really don’t want to be poked and prodded if it can be avoided. Perhaps it's just old age, after all?
DOCTOR: Ms. McNabb, I understand your hesitation. However, these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out any serious underlying conditions. It’s better to be thorough and get a clear picture of what's going on. The echocardiogram is non-invasive. It involves placing sensors on your chest to create an image of your heart using sound waves – it’s painless, though it can be a little uncomfortable lying on the table for an extended period. We could start with the blood work and urine analysis, but if those don’t provide a clear answer, we’ll need to proceed with the EKG and echocardiogram. Delaying these tests could potentially worsen any underlying condition. It's important to be proactive, Ms. McNabb. I'm concerned about your heart.
PATIENT: Oh dear. I suppose you’re right. It’s just…a lot to take in. And the thought of all those tests…But you’re the doctor, and I trust your judgment. Very well. Let’s do the blood work and urine analysis first. And then…if you think it’s necessary, we’ll do the EKG and echocardiogram. Will you explain everything to me before each test? I’m not very good with medical things, you see. And I would appreciate it if you could…be gentle. This is all very frightening. And…what if something is wrong? What if it's something serious? I’m a very independent woman, Doctor, and the thought of needing help…well, it’s not easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I will explain each test in detail before it's performed. And I assure you, we’ll take things one step at a time. If something is wrong, we’ll discuss your options and create a treatment plan together. It’s important to remember that many heart conditions are manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. And there are resources available to help you maintain your independence. I’ll order the blood work and urine analysis now. The lab is down the hall, and the receptionist will give you the necessary paperwork. After that, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just…thank you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything, and for being patient with me. It’s just…a lot to process. I suppose I’ll go down to the lab now. I do have one small question, though. About the tests…will they be very expensive? I have private insurance, but…well, medical bills can be quite daunting, you know. I wouldn't want to cause any unnecessary financial hardship for my niece. It's just…something to keep in mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, the cost is a valid concern. I’ll have the billing department verify your insurance coverage and provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. They can also discuss payment options if needed. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please go down to the lab, and we'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. .
