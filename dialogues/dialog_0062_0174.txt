DOCTOR: Hi Nani, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I suppose you could say I haven’t been myself lately. A general… sadness, I think. I don't quite have the energy for much these days. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on. I would like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, “not yourself lately,” sadness and low energy. That’s a good place to start. It's completely understandable to want to figure things out quickly. Can you tell me a little more about this sadness?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… not a sharp sadness, if that makes sense. Not like a grief, although I've certainly had my share of that in my life. It’s more… a dull ache, constantly present. Everything feels… heavier, you know? Even things I used to enjoy. I used to love my garden, but now… I look at it and just feel tired. And I haven't been sleeping properly either. It's just… draining.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, a “dull ache” rather than a sharp grief. And it’s affecting things you normally enjoy, like your garden, and impacting your sleep. Okay. How long have you been feeling this way, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think… perhaps six months now? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, I suppose. I didn’t realize how bad it was getting until… well, until I found myself crying over nothing at all, just the other day. It frightened me, to be honest. I’ve always been a strong woman, and this… this feels very unlike me.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening, and it's affecting you enough to be frightening – that's important information. It's completely understandable to feel shaken when things change like that, and it takes strength to come in and talk about it. Aside from the sadness and low energy, are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite hasn't been the best. I used to enjoy cooking, Nigerian cuisine is my specialty, you know? But now, I just… don't feel hungry. I force myself to eat something, but it's not the same. And I’ve been… forgetful, I suppose. Little things. Misplacing my keys, forgetting appointments. Nothing major, but it’s unsettling. Is that normal? I do worry about my mind, you see. It’s important for my work, being alert and responsible.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some forgetfulness. Both of those can be connected to what you're describing, and it's good you're noticing these things. It is good to be aware. Let's talk a little bit more about the forgetfulness. Is it just recent things, like appointments, or are you having trouble remembering things from further back as well?
PATIENT: Mostly recent things, I believe. I can recall my childhood perfectly well, and I remember details from my years as a lifeguard without any trouble. It’s just… the day-to-day things. What I had for breakfast, whether I locked the door, things like that. It’s frustrating, because I pride myself on being organized and reliable. I’ve always been the one everyone comes to for help remembering things, and now… now I’m the one struggling. It's quite embarrassing, if I am honest.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know – it's mainly recent memory. And I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you're used to being the one others rely on. We'll explore this further. Now, let's broaden things a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns besides just not sleeping well?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, actually. I wake up very early now, often before dawn. And I can't seem to get back to sleep. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling, thoughts racing. And I haven’t been having… pleasant dreams, if that makes any difference. More… unsettling ones. I used to sleep soundly, like a log. Now… it’s fitful, and I wake up feeling more tired than when I went to bed. It's all very draining. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Waking early with racing thoughts and unsettling dreams. That paints a clearer picture. It is exhausting. Okay, Nani, to get a fuller understanding, I'm going to ask you a few more questions, just routine things. First, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I believe so. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. I haven’t weighed myself properly, mind you, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I’ve lost a few kilos. I haven't been eating much, as I mentioned, and I suppose that would explain it. It’s not intentional, I assure you. I just… don’t have the appetite for it. Is that something to be concerned about, Doctor? I do worry about my health, you know. Especially at my age.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that. Weight loss, along with the other things you’ve described, is something we need to investigate. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That is a rather personal question, isn’t it? . Well… yes, actually. I've been… constipated, if I am being frank. Nothing severe, but uncomfortable. I haven’t said anything until now, as it didn’t seem important, but I suppose it could be related to everything else. I haven't been drinking as much water either, I suspect. I simply haven't felt thirsty. It is all a bit… unsettling, Doctor. Are you thinking something serious is wrong? I do hope not.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being so open with me, Nani. It’s important to tell me everything, even things that feel a bit uncomfortable. Constipation is definitely something we'll consider. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had a bout of malaria when I was visiting my sister back in Nigeria a few years ago, but that was treated successfully. And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but I recovered well from that. Other than that… nothing major, I believe. I’ve always been quite healthy, despite my age. I've always been active, swimming and skiing kept me very fit. And I take a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. I’m usually quite careful about my health, you know. I do wish all of this weren't happening. It's making me feel rather anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, malaria treated successfully, gallbladder removed fifteen years ago, otherwise healthy with a daily multivitamin. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the multivitamin, as I said. I try to avoid taking unnecessary medications if I can. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible, you know? I used to make herbal teas for various ailments, but I haven't had the energy for that lately. Everything feels… too much effort. I did try a chamomile tea a few nights ago, hoping it would help me sleep, but it didn’t make much difference. Honestly, I am beginning to worry. Is this just… old age catching up with me? I do hope not. I still have so much to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the multivitamin. We’ll try to figure this out, Nani. It doesn't necessarily mean it's "just old age," and it's good you're seeking answers. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't ever had any allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything without any trouble, and I haven’t ever reacted badly to any medication. I consider myself quite lucky in that regard. My sister, on the other hand, is allergic to shellfish, but that’s neither here nor there, I suppose. I do pride myself on having a strong constitution. It's rather unsettling, all of this happening when I’ve always been so healthy. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor? I am hoping we can get to the bottom of this quickly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always warned me about the dangers of smoking, and I listened to her. I’ve always been very careful about my health, as I’ve mentioned. I believe in looking after myself, and that includes avoiding harmful substances. It's rather odd, all of this happening despite my best efforts. I do hope you can help me figure out what's going on. I am feeling quite anxious, to be honest. I simply want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. And, just one last thing, Nani. How is your alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, very little, Doctor. I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally – perhaps once a month, if that. I don’t enjoy it enough to drink it regularly, and I don’t need it to relax or anything like that. I prefer a cup of herbal tea, as I’ve mentioned. It’s rather odd, isn’t it? I live a very healthy lifestyle, and yet here I am, feeling so unwell. I am hoping you can find something that will help. I’d like to get back to my garden, and swimming again. It is all rather depressing, to be honest. I simply want to feel like myself again. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm ready to finish this interview if you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, thank you. No, I think that covers everything for now. Now, Nani, based on what you've told me – the sadness, low energy, loss of appetite, recent memory issues, constipation, weight loss, and changes in your sleep – there are a number of possibilities we need to explore. It could be something relatively straightforward, or it could be a bit more complex. I want to be thorough. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on internally. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I am ready for the examination, and I will happily have the blood work done. I simply want to find out what is wrong, and to get back to feeling like myself again. The sooner we can get to the bottom of this, the better. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I am ready to cooperate in any way that I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your vital signs. Could you please take a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here I am. Please, proceed when you are ready. I hope this doesn't take too long. I have several appointments later this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be late. Though, I understand, of course, that you need to do what is necessary to determine the cause of my ailments. I am ready to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani, your blood pressure is a little on the lower side – 110/70. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a very slight murmur when I listen to your heart. It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we’ll want to investigate further. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax and take some deep breaths. It’s a little tender in the lower abdomen, which could be related to the constipation you’ve been experiencing. No masses or obvious abnormalities, but it is definitely sensitive. Everything else appears normal on initial examination. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on internally, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. These tests will help us assess your overall health, check for any deficiencies, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid test, and vitamin D level. Yes, please, proceed with all of those. The more information we have, the better, I believe. I'm happy to have all of those tests done. I understand that it is important to be thorough, and I trust your judgement. When can I expect the results? And will you be contacting me directly, or will someone from your office be in touch? I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I’m rather anxious to get this sorted out. Perhaps I can schedule a follow-up appointment now, just to be on the safe side?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Someone from my office will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. We’ll discuss the findings in detail then and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated – aim for at least 8 glasses of water a day. And try to eat a balanced diet, even if your appetite isn't great. Small, frequent meals can sometimes be easier to manage. While we're waiting for the results, it's important to rule out any immediate concerns. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thankfully, no chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Just the general fatigue and sadness, and the issues we've discussed. I haven't felt unwell in any acute way, if that makes sense. Everything has been… gradual, as I've mentioned. A slow decline, rather than a sudden illness. I appreciate your concern, and I will certainly stay hydrated and try to eat a balanced diet. Small meals, you say? Yes, I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I feel a little more at ease now, knowing that we have a plan of action. I look forward to hearing from your office once the results are available. Is there anything else I need to do, or any other advice you can offer in the meantime? Perhaps a gentle exercise, or a calming activity? I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't had the energy for that lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, no chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. It's positive that it's been gradual. And you’re right to be proactive. As for advice, gentle exercise is a good idea, if you feel up to it. Even a short walk can be beneficial. And you're right, gardening is a wonderful activity, but don’t push yourself. Listen to your body. Focus on activities that you enjoy and that help you relax. Perhaps listening to music, reading, or spending time with loved ones. It's also important to prioritize sleep. Try to establish a regular sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine. One more thing: if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe headaches, changes in vision, or any unexplained bleeding – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've answered all of my questions, and explained everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness and your patience. I will certainly try to stay hydrated, eat balanced meals, and get as much rest as possible. And I will contact your office immediately if I experience any new or worsening symptoms. Thank you again for your help, Doctor. I feel a little more hopeful now, knowing that we are taking steps to address this issue. I look forward to hearing from your office once the results are available. I believe that concludes my visit, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe it does, Nani. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
