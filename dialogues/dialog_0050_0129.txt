DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Hatchard. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about my… well, my stool. It's black. Like, really black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis, all the time. I’ve been taking them for years. Is that what's doing it? I don’t want to sit here all day talking about this, if it’s just the pills.
DOCTOR: Black stools are certainly something we need to address, Mrs. Hatchard, even if it is potentially related to your arthritis medication. It’s important to rule out other causes. Now, when you say “black,” is it consistently black, or does it vary?
PATIENT: Consistently. Like… tar. You know? Not just a little dark, but black. And it smells… different. Not worse, exactly, just… metallic, I suppose. Look, I’ve lived seventy-three years, I know what normal stool looks like. This isn’t it. Can’t you just tell me if it’s the pills? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mrs. Hatchard, and I assure you I’m not trying to waste your time. However, simply attributing it to the medication without a proper assessment would be… irresponsible. The metallic smell is also pertinent information. Could you please tell me the name and dosage of the arthritis medication you're taking?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. It's… Naproxen. Five-hundred milligrams. Twice a day. Sometimes more if my hip is really acting up. I get it from Walgreens. Is that enough information for you? Really, I just want to know if I need to stop taking it. I can’t be laid up and dealing with this… this business.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Naproxen can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, which can manifest as black, tarry stools. However, we need to determine the source of the bleeding, if that is indeed the cause. I’m going to need to ask you a few more questions, and then I’ll need to perform a brief physical examination. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No vomiting. A little tired, but that’s just getting old, I figure. My stomach… it’s a bit tender, sometimes. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It comes and goes. Honestly, it's probably just gas. I get a lot of gas. Is that enough questions? Can we get this over with? My husband is waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: The abdominal tenderness is noteworthy, Mrs. Hatchard. While gas is a possibility, we must rule out more serious causes. To proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any history of ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, or anemia?
PATIENT: Ulcers? No. My mother had something… I think it was heartburn, bad heartburn. But me? Never ulcers. Anemia… the doctor told me my iron was a little low once, years ago. He gave me some pills. I don’t remember what they were called. Look, I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat my vegetables, you know? I don’t drink or smoke. This is all very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: That information is helpful. Now, regarding your current medications, besides the Naproxen, are you taking anything else, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, the one for seniors. And sometimes I take some Tums, if my stomach is really bothering me. But that’s it. Honestly, I barely take anything. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. I don’t like feeling all… medicated. Is that all? Can we please get to the examining part now?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Hatchard. I will need to listen to your abdomen and perform a brief rectal exam to check for any signs of blood. It's a standard procedure, and it will help me determine the next course of action. Please lie down on the examination table. I will try to be as efficient as possible.
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. A rectal exam. Just what I needed. Look, I really don't think this is necessary. It's probably just the pills. Can't you just prescribe something to protect my stomach? I'm a busy woman, you know. Fine, fine. But make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mrs. Hatchard, but a thorough examination is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. It’s not simply about prescribing something; it’s about ensuring your health and safety. Now, please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will begin by auscultating your abdomen. Normal bowel sounds present, though slightly diminished. No bruits or murmurs detected. Now, I will proceed with the rectal exam. Please inform me if you experience any pain. Stool is dark, tarry, and guaiac-positive. No palpable masses detected, but some tenderness upon palpation. As suspected, there is evidence of blood in your stool. This requires further investigation.
PATIENT: .
