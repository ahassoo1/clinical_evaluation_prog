DOCTOR: Bula Derick, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Well, my face… it’s been puffin’ up some. And my legs too, they’re kinda swollen. Not sure why though, to be honest. It just… happened. Been like that a few days now, I guess. Don't remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffiness in your face and swelling in your legs… that's good information to start with. It sounds a little concerning, so we'll definitely figure out what's going on. First, can you tell me a bit more about the timing?
PATIENT: Timing? What kinda timing? I told ya, I don't really remember when it started. A few days, maybe? Look, I ain’t good with dates and stuff. It just… appeared. I was watchin’ the telly, and I thought, “Huh, my face looks kinda funny.” Then I looked at my legs… same deal. It's not like it was sudden or anything, just… gradual. Does that make sense? I don’t go around measurin’ things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Derick. Don’t worry about being precise with dates, we'll work with what you do remember. So, it wasn't a sudden change, more like you noticed it gradually over a few days. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm. Not really. I'm a widower, ya know? Been on me own for… oh, a good while now. Same routine every day. Bit of telly, bit of fixin’ things around the house… mostly nothin'. I eat the same stuff, too. Simple stuff. Not fancy. Can't think of anything that changed, no. Why would somethin' change? Seems like a silly question, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Derick. We just need to rule things out. Okay, so no major changes in your routine or diet. Now, how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I eat. I mean, I gotta eat, right? Not much of a cook, so it's mostly simple things. Canned soups, sandwiches… sometimes I’ll heat somethin’ up. I haven't lost my appetite or anything. Still eat a good bit, actually. Though, now that I think about it, everything does taste a little… bland lately. But I figured that was just me gettin' old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appetite is good, although things taste a little bland. That's good information, thank you. And have you noticed any changes in how often you're needing to go to the bathroom – either to pee or… to have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Bathroom… oh. Well, now that you mention it… I have been goin' more often. Both of 'em, I guess. Not a huge deal, but I've noticed it. Thought it was just the water I was drinkin'. Gotta stay hydrated, ya know? It's been hot lately. Didn't think much of it. Always been regular, so this is a bit… off. But nothin' terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased trips to the bathroom, both urine and bowel movements. Good to know. Now, let's talk about any other symptoms. Have you been feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Tired? Well, yeah. Aren’t we all, at my age? But, no, not more tired than usual, I don't think. I sleep alright, mostly. I do wake up a few times during the night, but that’s just gettin’ old, like I said. Been achin’ a bit more, too, joints and stuff. But that's just arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. Not new, ya know? I wouldn't say I'm exhausted, just… normal old-person tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, normal old-person tired, with some existing joint pain. That's helpful. Let's move onto your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions besides the arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis, that's it, really. Had a bit of high blood pressure years ago, the doctor put me on somethin' for it, but I stopped takin' it. Didn't feel like I needed it. Been fine since. Never had any surgeries or nothin'. Just the usual aches and pains, ya know? I ain’t one for doctors, to be honest. Always told me nothin' was wrong, or just gave me pills. Not much use, if you ask me. I used to be pretty strong, could fix anything. Now… not so much. But that’s just age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, but off medication now. No surgeries. And you’ve mentioned you don’t typically see doctors often. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. Took some pills when I had the flu a few years back, and those were alright. Never had any hives or nothin’. I'm pretty tough, ya know? Can handle most things. Don't go around takin' a bunch of pills, so haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anythin’. Honestly, I don’t remember ever bein' allergic to a thing. Now my wife, she was allergic to everything. Poor woman. But me? No.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Did your parents or siblings have any medical problems like heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… now that’s a tough one. Didn’t really talk about that much with my folks. They weren’t ones for doctor visits either. My father, he worked hard, smoked a lot. Died young, lung cancer. My mother… she just… got old. I think she had some heart trouble at the end, but I wasn’t around much. Didn’t have any siblings, just me. So, not much family history to go on, really. They weren’t the type to go to doctors and get diagnosed with things. Just… tough folks. Like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of lung cancer in your father, and heart trouble in your mother. Alright. Now, one last thing before we do a quick exam. Do you drink alcohol, or do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Not after my father. Gave that up years ago. Alcohol… now and then. A beer with the telly, maybe. Nothing fancy. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Not every day, mind you. Mostly just on weekends, or when I'm feelin' a bit lonely. It helps me relax, ya know? Nothing excessive. Just a little somethin' to take the edge off. Not enough to cause any trouble, I don't think. Been doin’ it for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. Alright Derick, thank you for answering all those questions. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and face. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Go ahead. I guess. Don't expect much, though. I’m an old man. Probably nothin’ wrong with me. Just a bit puffed up, like I said. Hurry up though, I got the telly waitin' for me. Not much on, but it's better than nothin'. And be gentle, my bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Derick. And we'll get through this quickly. Okay, your blood pressure is a little high, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Alright, lungs sound good. I'm hearing a slight murmur with your heartbeat, we’ll want to investigate that further. Now, let me take a look at your legs. Okay, I see some swelling in your legs, as you mentioned. I can press on them and leave a little indent. That’s what we call pitting edema. And your face does look a bit puffy. Okay, that’s all for now. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found in the exam, I think we need to do some tests to figure out what's going on. I’m concerned about the swelling in your legs and face, the high blood pressure, and the murmur I heard. I'd like to order some blood work and a urine test. We’ll also want to get an EKG to check your heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, bother. More pokin' and proddin'? Look, I don’t like doctors and I really don’t like tests. Is it really necessary? Can’t you just tell me what’s wrong? I just feel a bit puffed up, that’s all. I ain't dyin' or nothin'. Can’t you just give me somethin' for the puffiness? A pill, maybe? I just want to get back to my telly. Honestly, all this fuss over nothin'. But… alright. If you insist. Just get it over with quickly, and try not to poke too much. And tell me what all these tests are for, ya know? I don’t like bein' in the dark.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Derick. I wouldn’t suggest these tests if I didn't think they were important. You’re right, feeling poked and prodded isn’t pleasant. The blood work will give us a lot of information about how your kidneys and other organs are functioning, and help us rule out any underlying infections or other issues. The urine test will also give us more information about your kidneys. And the EKG, that’s a quick and painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us figure out what’s causing the murmur I heard. The swelling in your legs and face could be caused by a number of things, and these tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. It's important to figure out the cause so we can get you the right treatment. I want to get you feeling better as quickly as possible, and these tests are the best way to do that. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work, urine test and EKG. They’ll send the results back to me, and we’ll discuss them as soon as I have them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You've convinced me, I guess. Just… don’t keep me waitin' too long for the results, ya hear? I ain’t got all day. And if it’s somethin' serious, you gotta explain it to me in plain English. None of that doctor talk. And don’t poke too much. Seriously. Is there anythin' I gotta do to prepare for these tests? Fastin’ or somethin’? I don’t want any surprises. Just tell me what I gotta do, and I’ll do it. But no promises about bein’ happy about it. Now, where do I go for these tests? And how long will it take? I got the telly waitin’, ya know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Derick. I’ll make sure to explain everything in plain English, and I won’t keep you waiting any longer than necessary. For the blood work, you do need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. You can have water. The urine test, you just need to give them a sample when you go. It’s simple. And the EKG is painless and doesn’t require any preparation. I'm writing you a referral to the lab at City General Hospital. It’s about a 15-minute drive from here. They usually take appointments, so you might want to call ahead. The number is 555-123-4567. They should be able to tell you how long it will take, but usually blood work and an EKG take about an hour or so. The urine test won’t take long at all. I'll have the receptionist print out the referral and the lab's address for you. And I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, usually within a few days. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright. City General, 555-123-4567, 8-12 hour fast. Got it. I think. I always forget these things. City General... I hope they got comfortable chairs. And a telly in the waitin' room. That's important. So, you'll call me when the results are in. And you promise to explain it in plain English? None of that medical mumbo-jumbo? I don't need to know the scientific names of everything. Just tell me what's wrong, and what I gotta do about it. Alright, I guess that's everything. I'm goin' to go now. And thanks… I think. Now, where's that receptionist? And does she have comfortable chairs? I got a telly waitin’ for me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Derick. I absolutely promise to explain everything in plain English. And I hope you find a comfortable chair and a good show while you wait. Here's the receptionist, she'll get you all set up. Have a good day, Derick. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
