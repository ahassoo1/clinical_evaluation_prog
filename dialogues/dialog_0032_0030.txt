DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 49 years old. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 49. Um, well, it’s a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in… my body odor. It just doesn’t smell like me anymore, if that makes sense. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month, and it’s kinda worrying me.
DOCTOR: Body odor, you say. And you find this… different?
PATIENT: Yes, very different. I always smelled…clean, you know? Like soap and…well, just clean. Now it’s…hard to explain. A little bit musky, maybe? Not bad, exactly, but definitely not what I’m used to. And it seems to be getting stronger. I use the same soap, the same deodorant…everything. That's why I thought maybe something was wrong.
DOCTOR: Hm. A change in body odor… interesting. And you haven’t altered anything else in your routine recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything’s pretty much the same. I eat the same things, I do the same work… I mean, I’m a floor layer, so it is physical work, but I’ve been doing that for years. No new lotions, perfumes, nothing like that. I did start taking a new vitamin a few months back, a multivitamin for women over 40, but that was before this started. It's called "Vitality Blend", I think. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: “Vitality Blend,” you say. We’ll note that. It could be a factor, though I find it rather unlikely. Before we delve into potential vitamin-related causes – which, frankly, are often overstated – let’s establish a clearer timeline. When did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was probably around the end of June, maybe the very beginning of July. It was subtle at first, just a little…off. I thought maybe I hadn’t washed properly after work one day, but it kept happening even when I was really careful. Then it started getting noticeably different, stronger, like I said. It's definitely been more pronounced in the last two weeks or so. I just wanted to get it checked out, you know? It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, we’ll try to get to the bottom of this. Now, outside of this change in odor, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no weight loss or gain, no night sweats… I feel pretty normal, actually. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I always chalked that up to the work. It's hard labor. No changes in my bathroom habits, no skin rashes, nothing like that. Just… the smell. And the worry. I haven’t noticed any lumps or anything either, if that’s what you were going to ask.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. I take Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains from the job. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that’s it. I’m on Medicare, so they usually keep pretty good track of things. Would they have that information here?
DOCTOR: Yes, thankfully, Medicare provides a reasonably comprehensive history. Let me see… Lisinopril, as you said, for hypertension, cholecystectomy ten years ago… no recent hospitalizations or concerning diagnoses. Now, any family history of… unusual medical conditions, perhaps?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother had diabetes, type 2, but that was later in life. My father was healthy as a horse until he passed away suddenly from a heart attack. My sister has asthma, but that’s it. Nothing really stands out as… unusual. No cancers or anything like that. We're Ethiopian, and honestly, health problems weren't really discussed much when I was growing up. It was more just… dealt with. Does that make sense? It wasn’t a very open thing.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, we’ll proceed with a physical examination. It's unlikely to be something serious, but it’s always best to rule out any underlying causes. Please, lie back on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and examine your skin.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this, Doctor. It really is bothering me, and I'm glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, respiratory rate is 16, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, if you’ll just lift your arms for me… I’m going to auscultate your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin is… normal appearance, no rashes or lesions noted. I’m now going to palpate your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. Now, I’m going to examine your thyroid gland. Thyroid is normal size and consistency, no nodules felt. All right. Everything appears normal on initial examination. However, we’ll need to run some blood tests to be certain.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear, I guess. Blood tests, alright. What kind of things are you looking for? Is there anything I should be worried about? I know you said everything looks normal, but my grandmother always said you never know what’s going on inside.
DOCTOR: Your grandmother was… prudent. We’ll perform a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. The CBC will rule out infection or anemia. The CMP assesses your kidney and liver function, and electrolyte balance. The TSH test evaluates your thyroid function, though I’m quite confident that isn’t the issue. We are primarily ruling things out at this point. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but it's best to have a baseline. I will also order a urinalysis, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies to medications that I know of. I've taken all sorts of things over the years. I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago, and I haven't tried it since. I'm not sure if that's still relevant. So, blood tests, urine test… and that's it for now? When will I get the results back? I really just want to know what’s going on. This is really unsettling, like I said. It’s not just the smell, it’s the fact that something has changed.
DOCTOR: Yes, the penicillin allergy will be noted. We’ll avoid prescribing any penicillin-based antibiotics. As for the tests, the results should be available within 3-5 business days. The lab will notify us directly. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend practicing good hygiene. While I’m confident this is not an infection, maintaining cleanliness is always advisable. And try not to worry unduly. As I said, your physical exam was unremarkable. It’s quite possible this is a minor fluctuation, or even something related to hormonal changes. However, we’ll obtain these tests just to be certain. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run the tests. I guess I’ll just try not to think about it too much until the results come back. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Very good. The nurse will escort you to the lab for the blood and urine samples. Please let her know if you have any difficulty walking or require assistance. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Purtee. And please, try not to fret. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I will. .
