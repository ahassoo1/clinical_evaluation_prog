DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, Doc. It's this… stuff. Coming back up. Reflux, the lady on the phone called it. Happens mostly when I lie down. It's… unpleasant. And I haven't got time for unpleasantness, you understand. I run things, I manage emergencies. I can't be dealing with this.
DOCTOR: Right. “Stuff” coming back up. Reflux, as the receptionist mentioned. And you find it particularly bothersome when lying down. I understand you're a busy man and don’t want this disrupting your schedule. Let's try to get a clearer picture of this “stuff,” if you don’t mind a few questions. Is it… painful?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not painful. Annoying, mostly. Like a… a warm tide coming up. And it leaves a bad taste. Like… old pennies. Honestly, Doc, it’s just… undignified. A man in my position shouldn’t be worrying about this. Is this going to take long? I have a meeting at eleven.
DOCTOR: Undignified, yes, I can appreciate that. Warm tide, bad taste… old pennies, you say. Alright. No pain, just discomfort and a rather unpleasant aftertaste. It shouldn’t take long, Mr. Altine, but I need to ask a few more questions to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Do you experience any burning sensation in your chest, along with this… tide?
PATIENT: Burning? No. Not really. A little… unsettled, sometimes. Like I ate something that didn’t agree with me. But no burning. Look, I eat sensibly. Steak, mostly. Good quality steak. And potatoes. Not all this… fancy stuff people eat now. I doubt it's my diet. It's probably something… environmental. We get a lot of dust around here, you know? From the roads. Is that what you're thinking?
DOCTOR: Alright, no burning. Unsettled stomach, perhaps. And you suspect it might be related to dust in the area. We can consider environmental factors, certainly. Now, besides when lying down, when else do you notice this happening?
PATIENT: Well… after I eat, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. And… if I bend over. Like tying my shoes. It's… inconvenient. Really inconvenient. A man shouldn’t have to worry about bending over! And I had it happen once… when I was laughing. Honestly, Doc, it’s embarrassing. I don’t need to be explaining this to people. Are you going to give me something for it, or what? I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: After eating, bending over, and even when laughing… Alright, that gives us a bit more to work with. It sounds like it’s triggered by increases in abdominal pressure. Before we jump to medication, I'd like to do a quick examination, just to rule out anything more serious. It's a standard procedure. It won’t take long. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Examination? Look, I'm a perfectly healthy man. Steak and potatoes, remember? I haven't been sick a day in my life, except for that time with the flu in ‘87, but that was just a bad batch of something at the VFW. Honestly, Doc, I’m wasting my time here. What are you even looking for? I manage emergencies. I don’t have emergencies. I solve them. This is… ridiculous. But fine. Get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. It's just a standard procedure, Mr. Altine. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll just gently feel your abdomen. It will help rule out anything beyond simple reflux. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’ll grab my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect anything. I told you, steak and potatoes. And good genes. My grandfather lived to be ninety-two. Ninety-two, Doc. He ran a farm, hard work all his life. This whole thing is… a waste. Hurry it up. I have a schedule to keep. And try not to poke too hard. I’ve got important things to do.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little… sensitive. There. Not pain, exactly. Just… awareness. It’s always been a little tender there, to be honest. Probably from… lifting things. I used to move a lot of things. And… a bad fall when I was younger. But nothing serious. Really. Just… aware. Don't poke so hard. You’re making me nervous. This is unnecessary. I need to get back to work. People are relying on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some tenderness in the upper abdomen, as you’ve noted previously. No masses palpable. Given your history and the physical examination, it’s most likely gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD. The tenderness could be from previous injury or simply muscle strain. However, the fact that it’s triggered by bending over and lying down suggests some degree of hiatal hernia may be present. To confirm, an endoscopy and possibly a pH monitoring test would be ideal, but that would require a referral to a gastroenterologist. For now, we can start with a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, a medication to reduce stomach acid. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Proton pump… what now? And hiatal… hernia? Look, Doc, I don’t speak medical. I manage people. I deal with facts, not fancy words. You want me to take a pill? That's it? After all this poking and prodding? And a referral? I don’t have time for referrals. Just… give me the pill. Whatever it is. As long as it stops this… unpleasantness. But I expect results. Quickly. And no side effects. I have responsibilities. A town is relying on me. Is this pill going to affect my… performance? I need to be sharp. That's important. Really important.
DOCTOR: Yes, a proton pump inhibitor. It reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. It's a common medication, generally well-tolerated. Side effects are rare, but can include headache or diarrhea. I'm prescribing omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, before breakfast. As for affecting your performance, it’s unlikely. However, if you experience any unusual symptoms, stop taking it and contact me immediately. I strongly recommend the referral to a gastroenterologist for proper evaluation, but we can start with this medication and see if it provides relief. If your symptoms persist or worsen despite the medication, the referral becomes even more crucial. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… results. I need to be back at work. People are depending on me. I don't have time to be dealing with… this. And I expect a quick recovery. No excuses. If this pill doesn't work, I'm finding another doctor. One who understands the importance of… efficiency. .
