DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Coby, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Sammie Coby. Though most folks just call me Sammie. What’s this about, exactly? I don’t usually bother doctors unless somethin’ really bothers me. And this heat… well, it’s been somethin’ else this year, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s focus on why you’re here today, Mr. Coby. The heat is… irrelevant. Perhaps you could describe what’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Irrelevant? You try spendin’ eight hours a day on a roof in this sun and tell me it's irrelevant! But fine, fine. It’s… I just get too hot. Too hot. Like, quicker than I used to. And it doesn’t take much. Little bit of work, bit of sun, and I'm feelin' faint, gotta sit down. It’s not like I’m suddenly weak, I’ve been doin’ this work for forty years. It’s just… different now. Makes a man wonder what’s goin’ on, you know?
DOCTOR: Forty years on a roof… right. And this has developed… recently?
PATIENT: Well, not overnight. Started maybe… last summer? A little bit then, thought it was just a bad spell. But it’s gotten worse this year, definitely. Like I said, used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I gotta take breaks every hour, drinkin’ gallons of water. It's slowin' me down, and frankly, it's costin' me money. Not exactly somethin’ I want to be dealin' with at my age.
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms accompanying this… increased sensitivity to heat?
PATIENT: Sensitivity? It’s more than sensitivity, it's like my body can't handle it. Anyway… other symptoms? Hmm. Not really. I get a little dizzy, like I said. And maybe a bit more tired than usual. But I always work hard, so bein' tired ain’t exactly news. No headaches, no rashes, nothin’ like that. Just… hot. And then kinda wiped out. It's annoyin', more than anythin'.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting with this, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Nausea? Vomitin’? Goodness, no! I ain’t been sick to my stomach or anythin’. I eat a good breakfast, good lunch. Steak and potatoes mostly. I don't have time for bein' sick. This ain’t some delicate condition, you know. I’m a workin’ man.
DOCTOR: Right. Any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications? Now, that's a good question. Let me think... No, nothin’ new. Just the usual stuff for my blood pressure, been on that for… oh, maybe ten years now? And a little somethin' for my arthritis, keeps the joints from lockin' up. Nothing changed though, doctor. Same pills, same doses. I keep 'em in a little organizer, makes it easy.
DOCTOR: And what exactly are these medications, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Well, now. A bit rude, aren't we? I told ya, blood pressure somethin’... Lisinopril, I think it is. And the arthritis one is… Meloxicam. See? I do know my medications. I’m not senile, you know. Keeps my joints from screamin' at me when the weather's bad. And they haven’t changed, not one bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get on with it. I got a job to get back to, you know. Can’t sit around all day talkin’ about the heat. I’m a practical man. Let's see what you need to poke and prod.
DOCTOR: If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. And I'd like to check your hydration status as well.
PATIENT: Hydration status? Sounds fancy. Alright, alright. Don’t mind me. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? These old bones ain’t what they used to be. Get on with it, doctor. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated, 150 over 90. Pulse is a little rapid, 92. Lung sounds are clear, but… slightly diminished. Skin is warm and dry. No obvious signs of dehydration yet, but it's something we need to monitor. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Hmm. It's not much, but it does point towards… possible volume depletion. Let’s get a blood test. We’ll check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count.
PATIENT: Electrolytes, kidney function, complete blood… honestly, doctor, you’re losin’ me. What does all that mean? Is somethin’ seriously wrong? I just thought it was the heat. Volume… what was it? Is that bad? I'm a simple man, you can’t just throw all these words at me. Tell me straight, is this somethin’ I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I'm not going to alarm you. But your symptoms, combined with what I'm hearing, could indicate a few possibilities. It’s not necessarily serious, but we need to rule things out. The blood tests will help us determine if your kidneys are functioning properly, if you’re dehydrated, and if there are any other underlying issues contributing to this. It could be as simple as needing to adjust your fluid intake, but we must be thorough. I’m ordering a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. The lab is downstairs. Go down there, and I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Do try to drink plenty of water in the meantime.
PATIENT: Plenty of water? Of course I drink plenty of water! I work on a roof all day! Honestly, doctors these days... Alright, alright, I’ll go get the tests. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And I’m holdin' you responsible if it turns out to be nothin'. Point me to the stairs, will ya? And try to explain it in plain English when you call, doctor. Plain English.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, turn left, and it's the first door on your right. And yes, I will endeavor to explain the results in… a manner you can understand. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Doctors… .
