DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s this skin, Doctor. Getting darker, you see? And the… the tiredness. Constant tiredness. Honestly, I haven't the time for this, but my wife insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue… alright. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the skin changes?
PATIENT: When… honestly, Doctor, it was some time ago. Months, I suspect. It's all a blur, you know. Old age, I presume. I was likely working. Always working. Rebar, mostly. It’s… a demanding job. Though less so now, of course. I'm not a young man. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Drahota. And it's good you mention the work. Where on your body are you noticing the darkening skin most prominently?
PATIENT: Prominently? Doctor, must you use such… precise language? It's on my arms, naturally. And… and my face, I suppose. Everywhere the sun touches. Though I always wear a hat. A good hat. This isn't getting us anywhere, is it? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Mr. Drahota. And I apologize if my language is too technical. It's helpful to know where the changes are occurring. Now, has the tiredness come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Gradual, of course! Do you think I simply woke up exhausted one morning? It's been building for… well, a long time. Years, perhaps. It comes with the work, with the age, with… life, Doctor. Honestly, I fail to see what this has to do with the skin. It's all very… inefficient.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, gradual onset of tiredness over years, and darkening skin primarily on areas exposed to the sun. Do you notice any itching, pain, or blistering associated with the skin changes?
PATIENT: No, no itching. Pain? Certainly not. Blistering… good heavens, no. Just… darker skin. It’s unsightly, my wife says. She fusses over these things. I suspect it’s just a lack of… proper vitamins. Though I eat a perfectly balanced diet, I assure you. Mostly fish, and rice. Do we need to continue this line of questioning? It’s rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions, Mr. Drahota, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Normal. Weight? Perhaps a little less, now that I think about it. Though it’s difficult to say. I’m not one to weigh myself regularly. I eat when I’m hungry, and I suppose I eat a little less these days. Age, again, I presume. Is this pertinent? Because I have a luncheon appointment I simply must attend.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, gradual onset of fatigue, darkening skin on sun-exposed areas, and a slight decrease in weight. Now, just to get a fuller picture, can you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, dear. That was… a long time ago. Something with the blood pressure, perhaps? And… arthritis, I believe. In the knees, mostly. It flares up with the weather. And… that’s all I can recall, honestly. It was a rather busy period, you see. I had a business to run. I doubt it’s relevant. I've always been… robust. I don’t get sick. Do we have to dwell on this?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. High blood pressure and arthritis. And you said it flares with the weather. Do you take any medications for those conditions currently?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I detest taking pills. Always have. A little liniment for the knees when they bother me, that's all. My wife tries to insist, but I simply refuse. She worries too much about… everything. Honestly, Doctor, I believe I've answered all your questions. Are we finished? Because I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more quick questions, then we'll do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I eat everything. I've travelled extensively, you see. Every kind of food imaginable. I’m a robust man, as I've said. I don't have allergies. This is… frankly, quite unnecessary. Are you quite finished with the questioning? Because I’m growing rather tired of this whole exercise. Honestly, it’s a waste of both our time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. No known allergies. Now, if you’d permit me, I’d like to just take a quick look at your skin and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Can we do that now?
