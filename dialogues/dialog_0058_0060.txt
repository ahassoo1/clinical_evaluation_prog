DOCTOR: Alright, Blain, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor… Todorovich, is it? Look, my family… we have a history. A bad history of… things. My grandmother, my uncle… early heart problems, cancer, you name it. It’s always something. I’m still young, I get that. But honestly? It keeps me up at night. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I’d like some reassurance, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, a family history of heart problems and cancer… that is concerning, understandably. It’s good you’re being proactive about it. “Reassurance” isn’t a medical term, but we can definitely do some things to get a better picture of your current health and risk factors. Let's start with you. Can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not much. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I broke my arm once falling out of a tree – that’s about it. I haven't really needed to go to the doctor much, which, I guess, is a good thing. But… you know. That’s why I’m here now, isn't it? It feels… irresponsible to just assume I’m okay because I haven’t gotten sick yet.
DOCTOR: Right, “unremarkable” is good. Still, “no problems” isn’t the same as knowing everything is alright. It’s good you’re thinking this way. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides the broken arm?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been in a hospital as an adult. And the arm… that was when I was, like, ten. A really dumb idea, trying to climb that tree. My parents were furious. Honestly, I think they're probably glad I'm finally getting a check-up, even if it’s just for worry. They’re the ones who keep telling me to “be careful” and “get it checked out”. Which… is why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. Let’s talk about your family a little more specifically. You mentioned heart problems and cancer. Do you know what kind of heart problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics. That’s… where it gets fuzzy. My grandmother, she had… something with her valves, I think. My aunt kept saying “mitral valve prolapse” or something. And my uncle… it was more like heart failure. He was pretty young, actually. Early fifties. As for the cancer… my mom’s sister had breast cancer, and my cousin had… leukemia, I think. It was a long time ago. I was a kid. Everyone just sort of… dealt with it. No one really talked about the details. It wasn't a very… open family, if that makes sense. It's frustrating, I know, not having all the information.
DOCTOR: Right, "limited details." That does make things more difficult. It's good you're trying to be proactive despite that. Okay. Let’s move on to you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mom always worried about that too, especially when I was little. She made me try everything to make sure. I think she was just preemptively covering all her bases, knowing our family history. It’s annoying, really, all the worrying. But… I guess it's just her way of showing she cares. I’ve never even needed an EpiPen, or anything like that. I'm pretty robust, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies. Good. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don't even take vitamins. I figured if I was going to be healthy, I should just eat well and exercise, you know? No need to rely on pills if I could help it. I've always been… pretty self-sufficient, I guess. I don't like the idea of needing something just to function normally. Plus, my mom always said too many medications can be worse than the illness itself. She read something about that online, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. Okay. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Honestly, I feel like I’m wasting your time. I told you I’m healthy. But if you need to listen to my heartbeat, go ahead. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have things to do, you know. I took the afternoon off for this… mostly to appease my mother.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat on the table. It will only take a few minutes. Please remove your shirt and shoes. And try to relax. It will make it easier.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry it up, okay? This is really uncomfortable. And it’s cold in here.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is 72 and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 118/76. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Everything appears normal, but given your family history, I recommend some blood work. We’ll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and a complete blood count. It will give us a better idea of your overall health.
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly. I knew it. You’re just going to poke and prod and find something wrong, even if there isn't anything wrong. But fine. Whatever. Just… tell me when and where. And how long it will take? I really don’t have all day. And do I need to fast? My mother will have a fit if I don’t follow the instructions perfectly.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or drink other than water. The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. You can go anytime today. It will take about 15 minutes. They’ll send the results back to me, and I’ll contact you when I have them. It will likely be a few days. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell my mother it’s done. She'll be relieved, I guess. And I suppose I should thank you… for wasting my afternoon. But honestly, I’m still not convinced this is necessary. I think that’s everything. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. The lab will give you the paperwork for your mother. And please, try to relax. We're just being thorough. .
