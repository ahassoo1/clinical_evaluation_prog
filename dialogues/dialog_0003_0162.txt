DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, no offense, but I don’t really do small talk. Bloating, alright? Been happening for… a while now. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It’s uncomfortable, makes my clothes fit weird, and it’s just… annoying. Can we figure out what’s causing it and get it fixed?
DOCTOR: Very well. "A while now" is… not particularly helpful, Mr. Kristofik. But I suppose we can start there. Can you describe the bloating?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… puffy. Like a balloon, okay? My stomach gets big. And hard. It happens after I eat, usually. Not every time, but most of the time. Look, I drive a pile driver for a living, I don’t spend my days analyzing my insides. Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: A pile driver… yes, strenuous work. And you say it occurs after eating, predominantly. Do you notice any particular foods that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Trigger? I dunno. Food is food, right? I eat what’s available. Sometimes it’s burgers, sometimes it’s… I don’t know, sandwiches. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to what specifically causes it. It just… happens. Maybe beans? People say beans do that, but I haven’t really kept a log or anything. I really doubt it's the food. It's probably something else.
DOCTOR: A log… precisely. It's always the details that are lacking. Very well. Aside from the bloating, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? Pain? No, not really. Just… uncomfortable. Full. Like I ate too much, even when I haven’t. Sometimes I burp a lot, but everyone burps. I get tired easily, but that's just from the job, alright? It’s a hard life. What are you looking for, doc? This is getting ridiculous. I came in for bloating, not a full body checkup.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Kristofik, I am attempting to establish a comprehensive understanding of your condition. “Tired easily” could indicate a number of things. Do you experience any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Now you want to talk about… that? Look, I go when I need to go, alright? Sometimes it's normal, sometimes it’s… not. What difference does that make? I'm a construction worker, not a… a digestive specialist. I'm not gonna sit here and analyze my… everything. Is this covered by my insurance, by the way? Because I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time. And money. .
DOCTOR: Insurance is a separate matter, Mr. Kristofik. But a change in bowel habits is relevant. Has there been any blood in your stool?
