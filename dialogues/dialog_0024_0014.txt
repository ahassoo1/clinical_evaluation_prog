DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what did bring me in? My wife, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… papers? For work, I think. I’m… Directors, Religious Activities, that’s me. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. She said something about needing to take some time… maybe? Is that right? Do you need me to sign something?
DOCTOR: “Papers,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, papers. She was quite insistent. Something about… being able to, well, not be at work for a bit. It’s all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is this about… FMLA? That’s what I think she mentioned. Does that ring a bell? It's terribly frustrating, not being able to recall details. She handles most of the… the administration.
DOCTOR: So, you’re here regarding potential medical leave from your position as… Director of Religious Activities?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right! Director… that’s it. And leave… yes, that must be it. My wife, she worries, you see. Says I’ve been… slower lately. Not feeling quite myself, I suppose. Though, what is “myself” these days? Honestly, I just want to get these papers sorted and get back to… well, to things. Are we talking about a long leave, do you think? I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Let’s review your chart first. I see you are 67 years of age, Tahitian descent, height 188 centimeters, weight 111 kilograms. Do you have any known allergies, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. Nothing that’s ever caused a real problem. I used to get hay fever as a boy, but that was… well, a long time ago. Mostly just a bit of a sniffle. No, I don’t believe I have any serious allergies. My wife always handles the medical things, you see. She'd know for sure. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is always important to have a complete medical history, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. Let me see. I take a little something for my… blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill, every morning. And sometimes, if my joints are acting up, I’ll take something for that too. Just over-the-counter, you know, ibuprofen or something. Nothing fancy. Honestly, I can’t remember the names of them. My wife keeps a list, she does. I just take what she gives me. Is that a problem? Should I be writing these things down?
DOCTOR: It’s…suboptimal, Mr. Limtiaco, to not know what medications you are taking. We need to have a clear understanding of your current treatment regimen. Now, let's move on. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant illnesses… well, I had a bout of… something when I was younger. Pneumonia, I think. It was a long time ago, though. And I had my appendix out, of course. Everyone has their appendix out, don't they? Apart from that… I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. My wife would know more specifics. She remembers everything. Is there a reason you’re asking about all of this? Is it connected to these papers?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, we are establishing your medical background to determine if you are eligible for medical leave. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My father, he had a… a heart condition, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young. And my mother, she lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. That’s about all I really recall. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much, you see. A lot of it is just vague recollections. Is this important for these papers? I feel like I’m just rambling. My wife is usually the one who handles all of this. She has a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is important, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. Not a smoker. Never have been. My father smoked, a pipe, but I always thought it was a dreadful habit. No, I don’t smoke. And I don’t drink much either, just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Nothing excessive. A pretty quiet life, all things considered. Is that what you’re looking for? I'm beginning to feel quite confused, if I'm honest. All these questions… My wife will be much better at explaining things. Is she allowed to join us?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, we are trying to gather necessary information. Now, before we proceed further, can you describe what brought you here today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Today… well, as far as I can tell, my wife sent me. Something about these papers. She said I needed to get something signed so I can… take a break from work? I’m a Director, Religious Activities. I think she's worried about me being… slower, a bit forgetful. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted and go home. It's all very muddled, and I feel quite helpless. I wish she were here. She'd explain everything so much better. I really don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. Is this about being sick? I don't feel particularly sick. Just… tired. A bit confused. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Limtiaco. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination to assess your current condition. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A physical examination… Very well. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you see. Blood pressure… is that what we were talking about earlier? The little white pill? I do hope it’s not too much trouble. It’s just… a bit unnerving, all these questions and examinations. I'm trusting you'll sort this out.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated: 160/95. Pulse is 80. Respiration is normal. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, but with some diminished breath sounds. Abdomen is soft, but with some tenderness in the upper quadrants. Reflexes are diminished. Overall, your physical exam reveals some concerning findings, Mr. Limtiaco. We need to conduct further testing to determine the cause of these abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Concerning findings? That doesn't sound good, does it? Further testing? What kind of testing? Is it something serious? My wife… she'll be very worried. I told her I'd just be a quick visit for some papers. Is this about my heart? The muffled sounds? I haven’t been feeling particularly unwell, just tired and a bit confused. Perhaps I just need a good rest. Is that what you think? Please tell me it's nothing too serious. I really don't want to worry my wife.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis. However, based on the preliminary findings, we need to rule out several possibilities, including cardiovascular issues and neurological decline. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, an EKG, and a CT scan of the head. It is crucial that you follow through with these tests promptly. I also recommend a consultation with a cardiologist and a neurologist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, an EKG, and a CT scan? That sounds… extensive. And a cardiologist and a neurologist? That’s a lot of doctors. I… I don’t know. It’s all a bit overwhelming. Will these tests be… painful? And what if they find something… bad? My wife… she’s going to be so worried. Could we perhaps just… try the papers first? Maybe it’s just a bit of stress? I really don’t think I need all of this. Is there no other way? Perhaps a simple blood pressure medication adjustment? I’m trusting you to do what’s best, but this feels… excessive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, I understand your concerns, but we cannot simply dismiss these findings. Your symptoms and the initial examination results warrant a thorough investigation. Ignoring potential problems would be irresponsible and could have serious consequences. The tests are not overly invasive. The blood tests involve a simple blood draw, the EKG is a non-invasive heart rhythm recording, and the CT scan utilizes X-rays to create images of your brain. I will explain the results of each test in detail and discuss all treatment options with you. However, right now, we need to gather more information. I am ordering these tests to ensure your health and well-being. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh dear. I… I don’t know. My wife always handles the medical things, you see. I honestly can’t recall. I don’t think so, but I wouldn’t be certain. I haven't had any scans before, as far as I can recall. Is it… is it something I should be worried about? I feel quite flustered, and all these tests are rather frightening. Could we perhaps speak to my wife? Just for a moment? She’d know all of this. I really don't want to make any mistakes. I'm trusting you, Doctor, but I’m feeling very lost and confused. This is all happening so quickly. I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, I understand your anxiety. However, delaying these tests will only prolong the uncertainty. As for contacting your wife, she is not present, and we cannot rely on secondhand information. We will proceed with the tests as scheduled. I will provide you with detailed instructions, and a nurse will be available to answer any questions you may have. Let’s focus on getting these tests completed. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can determine the best course of action. I’m printing out the orders for the lab and radiology departments now. You can schedule the appointments at the front desk. .
