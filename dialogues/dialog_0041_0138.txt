DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she was the one who made the appointment. She's worried about me, you see. I’ve been… having a little trouble lately. It’s hard to explain, exactly. Mostly just feeling a bit weak on one side, sometimes. And the headaches… well, my mother had terrible headaches, always did. So, that's what got my daughter concerned.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness on one side and headaches... and your daughter is rightfully concerned, especially with your mother's history. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me when you first started noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when was it? That’s… a tricky one. It comes and goes, you see. It wasn’t all at once, not like a fall or anything. More like… a little stumble here and there. Maybe a few months ago? It’s hard to say for sure. Everything seems to blend together after a while, you know? I try to remember, but… it just doesn't stick.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly understandable. A few months ago, coming and going… And is this weakness on just one side of your body, or does it move around?
PATIENT: It’s mostly my right side, I think. My right arm feels… heavier, sometimes. And my leg too, a little wobbly. It doesn’t happen all the time, thankfully. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and others… well, others I have to be a bit more careful. It’s not painful, not usually. Just… weaker.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the right side, coming and going, and not usually painful. And you mentioned headaches… can you describe those headaches for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… they’re not like a throbbing pain, not always. Sometimes it’s more like a pressure, behind my eyes. And sometimes it feels like a band tightening around my head. They come and go too, like everything else. They used to be really bad, like my mother’s, but… I think they've gotten a little milder lately. Still, they worry me. My mother… she suffered so with them.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure behind the eyes, a tightening band sensation... and you feel they’ve been milder recently. Do anything specific seem to trigger these headaches, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know if anything specific triggers them. Sometimes if I’m tired, they seem worse. And… when the weather changes. You know, when it’s going to rain? Or when it’s very humid? That always seems to bother me. But it’s hard to say for sure. Sometimes they just… happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and weather changes seem to be potential factors. Now, aside from the weakness and headaches, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, now that you mention it, I seem to be a bit… forgetful lately. My daughter keeps reminding me of things. Just little things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses, or if I already took my medicine. It's probably just old age, you know? It happens to everyone, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of the changes, Alayne. Forgetfulness can sometimes be a normal part of aging, but it's important to note it. Has this forgetfulness been getting worse over time, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: Oh, I think it’s been getting a little worse, yes. Not dramatically, but… I used to be very good with dates and names. Now, I have to write everything down. And even then, I sometimes misplace the list! My daughter says I shouldn’t worry so much, but it does bother me, you know? I like to keep my mind sharp.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely natural to want to stay sharp. And noticing changes like this is worth investigating. Okay, Alayne, to get a better idea of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just some basic checks of your strength, reflexes, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Strength and reflexes, you say? Alright. Just tell me what to do, dear. I might be a little slow, but I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. No worries at all. We’ll take it slow. First, could you please sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: There we go. Is that alright? It’s been a bit of a bother, getting older, you know. Everything aches a little bit.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that strong enough, dear? I don't want to hurt you!
DOCTOR: That's good, thank you. A little bit less strength on the right, which is what we were expecting, given what you've described. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please let your arms just relax in your lap?
PATIENT: There. All relaxed, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I hope it doesn’t take too long, dear. I get a little bit nervous with all these medical things.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. A little bit quieter response on the right side there too. Now, I'd like to check your coordination. Could you please point to your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright, Doctor? It's a little bit shaky today, I'm afraid. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. A little bit of shakiness and some difficulty with smooth movement. Okay, one final quick check. Could you please try to stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There we go… just a few steps. Oh dear, I'm a bit wobbly, aren’t I? I don’t like walking without someone to hold onto.
DOCTOR: Yes, a bit unsteady, and a slightly wider gait on the right side. Okay, thank you, Alayne. Please, sit back down. Alright. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some weakness and coordination issues on your right side, along with headaches and some forgetfulness. It's difficult to say exactly what's causing these symptoms without further investigation, but it could be related to a number of things. It’s important to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh dear… anything serious? That sounds a bit frightening, doesn’t it? I was hoping it was just old age, you know? But if you think we need to look further… then I suppose we should. What kind of investigations are you thinking of, Doctor? I trust your judgment, of course, but I do get a little nervous with all these medical things.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, and I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. The first thing I'd like to do is order an MRI of your brain. That will allow us to get a detailed look at what's going on inside, and rule out any structural problems. We’ll also want to do some blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions. The MRI is painless, but you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-40 minutes. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable. The blood work is just a simple sample taken from your arm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, an MRI… that sounds a bit scary. I've heard stories about being in those machines. Is it very loud? And being still for 30-40 minutes… I don’t know if I can hold still that long. My legs get restless, you know? And blood work… well, that’s not so bad, I suppose. I’ve had that done before. But an MRI… what are we looking for exactly, Doctor? And what if… what if it’s something serious? I don’t want to worry my daughter unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Alayne. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. The MRI machines can be loud, but we’ll give you earplugs to help minimize the noise. And we can take breaks if you need them – we don’t have to do the entire scan all at once. As for what we’re looking for, we want to rule out things like a stroke, a tumor, or any other structural problems that could be causing your symptoms. However, it's important to remember that most of the time, these scans come back normal. We're not trying to scare you, we’re simply being thorough. The blood work will help us rule out things like vitamin deficiencies or infections. It’s a precautionary measure, and the vast majority of the time, it doesn’t reveal anything serious. We’ll discuss the results with you and your daughter as soon as we have them. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes a little bit of sense, I suppose. Precautionary measure… that’s good. I like that. And taking breaks during the MRI… that’s reassuring. My daughter will be glad to hear that. She worries so much. So, what happens next, Doctor? Do I need to make another appointment? And when will I be able to get the MRI done? I have a bridge club meeting on Wednesday… I wouldn't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's get everything sorted out. I'll have my nurse schedule you for the MRI. We can try to find a time that works with your bridge club meeting. It's usually fairly quick to get an appointment scheduled. I'll also give you a referral for the MRI, and a list of instructions to follow before your scan. The nurse will explain everything in detail. After the MRI, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. It will probably be about a week from now, once we get the reports back. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms or if your current symptoms get worse, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Scheduling it around my bridge club… that’s thoughtful. And a week for the results… that seems reasonable. Hmm… let me see… Will the MRI show… you know… if my mind is… fading? My daughter has mentioned that I’ve been a bit forgetful lately, and I worry about… well, you know. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Alayne. And it’s good that you’re open about it. The MRI can help us assess the overall health of your brain, and can sometimes detect changes that might be contributing to memory problems. However, it’s important to understand that memory loss can have many different causes, and an MRI is just one piece of the puzzle. We’ll also do a cognitive assessment during your follow-up appointment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. This will give us a more complete picture of what’s going on. If we do find any evidence of cognitive decline, we can discuss various treatment options and support resources. But again, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. We need to see the results of the MRI and the cognitive assessment first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes sense. A piece of the puzzle… that’s a good way to put it. Not jumping to conclusions… my daughter always tells me that. I do worry, you know. But I suppose worrying doesn’t do any good. Well, I think that’s all my questions for now, Doctor. Thank you for your patience and for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind a little bit at ease, which is more than I can say for my daughter!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. I’m glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before your appointment. My nurse will be in touch to schedule the MRI. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and please try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're a very kind man. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I’ll try not to worry, but you know how daughters are! Have a good day, dear. And thank you again for everything.
