DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for the sleep apnea, you know – and it helps, but I still find myself awfully tired during the day. It’s just… persistent. It’s making things a little difficult, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Persistent daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. That's definitely something we need to investigate. To get a better picture of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about how tired you feel?
PATIENT: Hmm, how to describe it… It's not like I'm falling asleep standing up, but I feel… sluggish, you know? Like I'm wading through mud all day. And I have trouble concentrating. Reading, even just following a conversation sometimes… it takes extra effort. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s just… a constant drag. It interferes with things, certainly. I used to enjoy my gardening, but even that feels like a chore now. It's been going on for… oh, I’d say at least six months, maybe longer. I honestly lost track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a persistent feeling of sluggishness, difficulty concentrating, and it’s impacting your daily activities, like gardening. And you've noticed this for at least six months. That’s helpful to know. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a little bit more detail. First, how many hours of sleep would you say you typically get each night, even with the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a good question. It varies, to be honest. Some nights are better than others. I try to get at least seven, but… I’d say on average, maybe six and a half? It’s hard to say exactly. The machine’s supposed to be helping, and I do use it every night – well, almost every night. There was that one time on vacation… but other than that, pretty consistent. It just doesn't feel… restorative, you know? Even when I’m in bed for eight hours, I wake up feeling… not refreshed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around six and a half hours of sleep on average, despite consistent CPAP use, and it doesn't feel restorative. That’s important. Now, I’d like to ask about other things that might be contributing. Do you find yourself snoring, even with the CPAP machine on?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… It's hard to say, really. I mean, I don't hear myself snore, do I? My wife used to complain about it terribly, before… before she passed. She said it was like a freight train. But she’s not here to tell me now. I haven't slept with anyone since, so I honestly don't know if it still happens with the machine. It should be preventing it, but… I wouldn’t swear to it. It's possible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s a difficult situation, and it’s hard to know for certain without someone to observe. Let’s move on. Do you notice any daytime naps?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I try to avoid them, really. I find they just mess me up even more. But… sometimes I can't help it. Usually in the afternoon, after lunch. Just… a little doze. Twenty minutes, maybe half an hour. I feel guilty doing it, because I know it's not good, but I just… collapse. Especially if it’s warm. It’s not every day, mind you, but it happens. A few times a week, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional daytime naps, a few times a week, usually after lunch and lasting around 20-30 minutes. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. I've been on medication for that for… oh, goodness, must be fifteen years now. And my doctor mentioned my cholesterol was a bit high last year, so I’m taking something for that too. Other than that… no, not really. I had my prostate checked regularly for a while, but everything seemed fine. No diabetes, no heart problems, as far as I know. Just the usual aches and pains for an old man!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication for 15 years, and high cholesterol, also managed with medication. No known diabetes or heart problems. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've taken a lot of different medications over the years, and I don’t recall any bad reactions. Penicillin, of course, like everyone else. But other than that… no, I haven’t had any problems. I've never been one for allergies, really. Dust bothers me a little sometimes, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies other than a mild sensitivity to dust. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Can you tell me the names and dosages of all the medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have them written down here somewhere. Right. For the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And for the cholesterol, it’s Atorvastatin, 40 milligrams, also once a day. Oh, and I take a baby aspirin, 81 milligrams, every morning, just as a preventative measure. And… that’s it, I think. Sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, but that's just when it flares up and isn't a regular thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure, Atorvastatin 40mg daily for cholesterol, and 81mg aspirin daily. And occasional medication for arthritis flare-ups. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam. That’s alright, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Perfectly alright. Go right ahead, Doctor. I've had plenty of those over the years.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Within normal limits, though the blood pressure is a little on the higher side. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Nasal passages are clear. Ears appear normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally in all extremities. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Everything appears normal on initial examination, but your blood pressure is a bit elevated. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, do you have any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little at the end of the day, if I’ve been on my feet a lot, but nothing significant. It comes and goes, really. I wouldn’t say it’s a constant problem. Just a little puffiness sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional mild swelling in the legs and feet, but not constant. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities for your daytime sleepiness. The CPAP machine is helping, but it's not fully resolving the issue. Given your age and medical history, we should consider things like anemia, thyroid problems, sleep disorders beyond sleep apnea, and even medication side effects. To start, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your complete blood count, thyroid function, electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests are no problem. I've had plenty of those over the years, as you know. It's good to be thorough. It's just… tiring, always being tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is tiring, and we want to get to the bottom of this. I'm also going to order a sleep study, just to re-evaluate your CPAP settings and rule out any other sleep disorders that might be contributing. It will be a more detailed assessment than you’ve had previously. I’ll also want you to keep a sleep diary for the next week or so. Just jot down when you go to bed, when you wake up, how many times you wake up during the night, and how you feel during the day. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. A sleep diary… that sounds manageable. And another sleep study… well, it's a bit of a bother, but if it helps, it helps. You seem to be very thorough, Doctor, which I appreciate. I’m just glad we’re looking into this properly. It’s good to have someone listen. When should I start the diary? And where do I go for the sleep study?
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could help. You can start the sleep diary tonight. I’ll have the nurse give you a form with some specific instructions. It’s just a simple record of your sleep patterns. As for the sleep study, we’ll schedule you at the Sleep Center at St. Jude’s Hospital. I’ll have the scheduler call you tomorrow to arrange a convenient appointment. They’ll explain the process in detail. In the meantime, continue taking your current medications as prescribed. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful and I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was my pleasure. We’ll get these tests scheduled and then we can review the results together and develop a plan. Remember, if anything changes or you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call. The nurse will come in shortly to give you the sleep diary form and go over the instructions. Have a good day, and try to get some rest tonight!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
