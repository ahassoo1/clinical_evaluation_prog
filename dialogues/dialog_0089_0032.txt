DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Krok is the name, yes. Though… honestly, I can’t quite recall why I’m here. My wife, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… a bit of discomfort. It’s rather embarrassing to discuss, you understand. A man of my age shouldn’t be bothered with such things.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It's very common to feel that way, and completely understandable. Many things can cause discomfort, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out, even if you're not quite sure what's going on. Your wife sounds like a very caring woman. Let's try to narrow it down. Can you describe the discomfort for me?
PATIENT: Discomfort… yes. Well, it’s… a discharge, I believe she said. A bit of… leakage. Not a flood, mind you, just… present. And a little stinging, now that I think about it. It’s not constant, thankfully. More… intermittent. It's been going on… oh dear, I really can’t say how long. A week? Perhaps two? My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is this something serious, Doctor? I hope it's not anything… catching.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge with intermittent stinging. And you’re unsure of the duration, roughly a week or two. I understand your concern about it being serious or “catching,” as you say. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. First, let’s rule out anything infectious. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't believe so. My wife checks my temperature regularly, you see. She's very diligent. Chills… not recently. And body aches… well, my knees ache most days, but that’s just old age, I suspect. It’s the farming, you know. Years of bending and lifting. Is that relevant, Doctor? Are you asking about aches besides the usual ones?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the consistent temperature checks. And yes, I was asking about aches besides your usual knee pain, but that’s helpful information nonetheless. The farming certainly could contribute to aches and pains. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, urgency, or difficulty?
PATIENT: Urination… hmm. Let me see. I suppose I have been going a little more frequently, now that you mention it. Not dramatically, mind you, just… a few extra trips to the privy throughout the day. And perhaps a little bit of burning sensation when I… finish. It’s rather unpleasant, to be honest. My wife says I should drink more water. She's always telling me to drink more water. Is that what this is about? Simply not enough water?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency and a burning sensation with urination. It could be related to hydration, but the burning sensation suggests something else might be going on. Mr. Krok, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… well. I suppose it’s necessary. Though, I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding. I’ve never been one for medical examinations, if I’m honest. But… if you insist. Just… be gentle, Doctor. A man of my age isn't as resilient as he once was. And please, don't keep me waiting long. I have a rather important appointment with my tomato plants later this afternoon. They require pruning.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand completely. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s a fairly standard exam and will help us determine the cause of your discomfort. If you could just lie down on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'll need to examine your abdomen and, with your permission, perform a quick genital exam. We'll use gloves and ensure your privacy at all times. Before we start, can you tell me about any allergies you have, to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't believe I have any specific allergies to medications. I've taken various pills over the years, for my knees and my heart, and haven't had any reactions. Though… I am rather sensitive to dust. Makes me sneeze terribly, especially when I’m tending to the hay bales. And bees, of course. I’m terribly allergic to bee stings. A rather nasty experience when I was a boy. But as for medications… no, none that I’m aware of. Dust and bees, that’s about it. You may proceed, Doctor. But do be quick about it, if you would be so kind. My tomatoes are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no known medication allergies, just sensitivities to dust and bee stings. Good to know. We'll be careful to avoid any irritation. First, I’ll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I'll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness. After that, we'll do a quick external exam. Alright, Mr. Krok, I'm not detecting any acute tenderness, but there's some mild discomfort in the lower abdomen. Now, with your permission, I'll just take a quick look at the external genitalia. Please let me know if anything is painful or uncomfortable. Okay, Mr. Krok. I've noticed some redness and mild swelling around the opening of your urethra, and a small amount of discharge. It’s consistent with urethritis, which is inflammation of the urethra. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it's most likely caused by a bacterial infection.
PATIENT: Infection… bacterial, you say? Good heavens. Is it… catching? My wife would be terribly worried. And what does one do about a bacterial infection? Do I need… shots? Pills? I really dislike taking pills. They upset my stomach. And will this affect my tomatoes? Perhaps I should postpone the pruning until… well, until this is all over. This is rather unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling indeed. Is it serious? Will I be alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. It's natural to be worried. First, let’s address the “catching” part. Yes, it is contagious, but it's typically spread through close physical contact, so as long as you practice good hygiene and avoid intimate contact until it’s treated, your wife shouldn’t be at risk. As for your tomatoes, I don’t believe this infection will affect them! It’s not a systemic illness, so it won't impact your ability to garden. Now, about treatment. We don’t need any shots. The good news is, urethritis is usually easily treated with antibiotics – pills. I understand you dislike taking them, and we can discuss options to minimize stomach upset – taking them with food, for example. I’m going to prescribe you a course of Ciprofloxacin, a common antibiotic used for this type of infection. It's a 7-day course. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. It is considered a safe medication with limited side effects. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Seven days… pills… Well, it’s better than shots, I suppose. And if it means I can continue tending to my tomatoes, then I suppose I can endure seven days of pills. But if my stomach does become upset, I shall hold you personally responsible, Doctor. Just kidding, of course. Mostly. What other precautions should I take? Besides avoiding… intimate contact, of course. Should I avoid strenuous activity? Will this affect my water intake? And what about my wife? Should she be tested as well, just to be safe? I wouldn’t want to risk her health. She’s a very delicate woman. And please, explain these pills to me again. What do they do exactly? I always feel so helpless when it comes to these medical things. It’s all so… confusing.
DOCTOR: You’re not helpless at all, Mr. Krok. It's perfectly normal to feel confused and want all the information. That's what I'm here for. First, regarding precautions: While strenuous activity won’t worsen the infection, I recommend taking it easy for a few days until you start feeling better. Drink plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out the infection. As for your wife, I recommend she also get tested, even if she isn’t experiencing symptoms. It's better to be safe, and it’s important to rule out any potential transmission. We can schedule an appointment for her, or I can give you a referral to another doctor nearby. Now, about the Ciprofloxacin. It's an antibiotic, meaning it fights the bacteria causing the infection. It works by preventing the bacteria from multiplying, allowing your body’s immune system to clear it out. You take one pill twice a day for seven days, with plenty of water. It’s best to take it with food to minimize stomach upset. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild antacid, just in case your stomach does become upset. If you experience any severe side effects – nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain – stop taking the antibiotic and contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Severe side effects… nausea… vomiting… Oh dear. This sounds rather unpleasant. I believe I understand… mostly. Take pills twice a day with food. Antacid if my stomach rebels. Finish the entire course, even if I feel better. Wife gets tested. Avoid severe side effects. One question… about the wife. If she tests positive, will she need… pills as well? And will this affect her gardening? She has a prize-winning rose bush, you see. It’s a very delicate variety. I wouldn’t want anything to happen to her roses. And if we both have to take pills, will that affect our… digestion? I’ve read things about antibiotics disrupting the gut flora. It’s all very complicated. This infection is becoming a rather significant disruption to our lives, Doctor. A significant disruption, indeed. And is there anything… anything at all… I can do to prevent this from happening again? Other than, of course, avoiding intimate contact. Which, frankly, isn’t a very appealing solution.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Mr. Krok. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. Yes, if your wife tests positive, she will likely need a course of antibiotics as well. The treatment is usually the same – Ciprofloxacin for seven days. Regarding her roses, I don’t believe the antibiotics will affect them. The medication doesn’t pass into the soil or harm plants. You’re also right to be concerned about disrupting the gut flora. Antibiotics can kill off good bacteria along with the bad, which can sometimes cause digestive issues. I recommend taking a probiotic supplement while taking the antibiotics and for a week afterwards to help restore the balance of your gut bacteria. You can find them over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Now, regarding preventing this from happening again. The most common cause of urethritis is sexually transmitted infections, but sometimes it can be caused by irritation or changes in pH balance. Practicing good hygiene, staying well-hydrated, and urinating after intimacy can help prevent future infections. We can also discuss safe sex practices, if you’d like. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Safe sex practices… at my age? Oh dear. Well, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to be informed. But frankly, Doctor, I think we’ve covered enough ground for one visit. Seven days of pills, antacid if needed, probiotic supplement, wife gets tested, safe sex practices… and a lot of anxiety. I believe I have all the information I need, for now. Though, I must confess, I’m still rather worried about my tomatoes. But perhaps, with a little luck, and a lot of pills, everything will be alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… remarkably patient with an old man and his… discomfort. And please, remind me again… one pill, twice a day, with food? And the wife? What are the symptoms she should look for? I wouldn’t want her to ignore anything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. It was my pleasure. And yes, one pill, twice a day, with food. As for your wife, she should look for any burning sensation when urinating, increased frequency, urgency, or any discharge. Even mild symptoms should be checked out. And don't worry about your tomatoes! I’m confident you’ll be back to tending to them in no time. Here's my card. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get well soon, Mr. Krok. And enjoy your tomatoes!
