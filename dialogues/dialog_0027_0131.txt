DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s… good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mykeisha. Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister, Janelle, she told me I really should get it checked out. She worries about me, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mykeisha. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to take seriously. Janelle sounds like a good sister, looking out for you. “A bit high”... can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really keep track of numbers, if I'm honest. But I got one of those machines from the pharmacy, you know, for your arm? And it kept beeping at me, and the number was… red. Everything’s red when it’s bad, right? It felt higher than usual, anyway. I was a little scared, to be honest. I don’t like feeling sick.
DOCTOR: Red is… generally a sign that it’s higher than we'd like, yes. It’s good you got the machine; that's a helpful first step. Do you remember roughly what the number was when you saw red?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, numbers… let me think. It was… over 140, maybe? Possibly closer to 160? I really don’t remember exactly. It was a few days ago now. I was probably a little flustered when I took it, honestly. I was making lunch and trying to help my nephew with his homework at the same time. It's a lot!
DOCTOR: Okay, over 140… that is elevated. We generally aim for below 130/80. Being flustered can definitely affect it, yes. Alright, let’s get a reading now, just to see where things stand. Then we can talk about what might be going on. Do you have any known allergies, Mykeisha?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. None at all. I eat everything! Well… mostly. I don't really like okra, but that's a preference, not an allergy, right? I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat shellfish, nuts, everything. My sister always teases me about it, says I have a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know! A cast iron stomach is a definite plus. Alright, let’s get your blood pressure checked, and then we can talk a bit more about your medical history. Have you been to a doctor regularly before this?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I went for check-ups when I was pregnant with my nephew, but that was… oh, eight years ago now? Other than that, not really. I usually just tough things out, if I’m honest. I don’t like going to doctors much. Everything always feels rushed, you know? And I never really know what questions to ask.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people feel that way. We'll try to take our time today, and I want you to feel comfortable asking anything that’s on your mind. Now, aside from feeling a bit flustered when you took your blood pressure, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. Maybe a few headaches, but I get those sometimes. I think it’s just from staring at the computer all day. I work with… well, it's a little bit of everything, actually. Personal care, mostly. Helping people with everyday things. It’s a lot of running around, honestly. No dizziness or anything like that, though. Just tired, mostly. I've been feeling extra tired lately, but I thought it was just the heat. It's been so hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches and fatigue… We'll keep those in mind. And you said you're running around a lot for work. What about your family?
PATIENT: Yes, a lot of running around! And family... Well, my sister Janelle, she’s my rock, really. She’s got three kids, so it's always busy when we get together. My mom, she's doing okay, lives in Barbados still. I talk to her on the phone every Sunday. And then there's my nephew, little Mateo. He's eight, full of energy. That's my family, mostly. Never been married, so no husband or anything like that. Just me and my sister mostly. She worries about me a lot. I think she thinks I work too hard.
DOCTOR: That's good that you have such a strong support system. Alright, let's take a look at your blood pressure now, just to get a baseline. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Hopefully it's not too high. I was a little stressed just talking about it, probably. My sister is gonna kill me if it's really bad. She told me I should have gone to the doctor weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay… your blood pressure is currently 158 over 92. That is elevated, as you suspected. It’s definitely something we need to address. Do you take any medications regularly, Mykeisha?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't take any medications. Not even vitamins, usually. Just when I’m feeling a bit run down, maybe a multivitamin, but that's about it. Never been much of a pill-taker, if I’m honest. I prefer to just… get on with things, you know? I don’t like feeling weighed down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your blood pressure reading and the fact you've been experiencing some headaches and fatigue, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I have to pick up Mateo from school later. He gets very impatient, that boy.
DOCTOR: Alright, it won’t take long, I promise. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds… regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft. No tenderness. Now, could you please hold this pen and touch your finger to your nose, and then to my finger, and repeat that a few times?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. It’s a little harder than it looks, actually. My hands are a little shaky today. I haven’t been sleeping very well lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are a little bit brisk, and as you mentioned, your hands are slightly shaky. Everything else seems normal, but given your blood pressure and these findings, I want to order some blood work and an EKG just to get a better picture of what’s going on. It's standard procedure with elevated blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it'll help figure things out, I’m happy to do it. Blood work and an EKG, right? Will it take long to get the results? And will I have to come back here again? I’m a little worried about finding the time, honestly. Work’s been really busy lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work and an EKG. The blood work should take a few days to come back, and we can usually get the EKG results much faster—within a day or two. You would need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. We can schedule that for a time that works for you, I promise. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your stress and getting enough sleep. Also, I'd like to discuss lifestyle modifications to help lower your blood pressure, things like diet and exercise. Are you open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I'm open to anything, honestly. Diet and exercise... I know I should be doing more of both. I just… find it hard to make the time. I work long hours, and by the time I get home, I just want to collapse. But I understand it’s important. And I really want to get this sorted out. My sister would kill me if I didn't. What kind of things are we talking about, exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's hard to fit those things in, especially with a busy schedule. We're talking about things like reducing your sodium intake, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, and aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Even small changes can make a big difference. We can start with something small, like swapping out sugary drinks for water, or taking a short walk during your lunch break. I also want to talk about stress management techniques, things like deep breathing exercises or meditation. I can provide you with some resources and refer you to a nutritionist if you'd like. And before we finish, I want to discuss medication options, in case lifestyle changes aren’t enough to lower your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good, Doctor. Small changes… I can definitely try that. Water instead of soda, that's easy enough. And a walk during lunch, maybe. I suppose I can squeeze that in. A nutritionist... that might be helpful, actually. I don’t really know much about healthy eating. Medication… I'm a little nervous about that, to be honest. But I understand you might need to do that. If it's necessary, I guess. What happens if I don't take medication, then? Is it just… really bad? I don't mean to be difficult, I just like to know everything.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being difficult at all. It's good to ask questions. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to some serious complications, like heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and vision loss. That's why it's important to get it under control. Medication isn't always necessary, and we can try lifestyle changes first. If those aren't enough, medication can help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of complications. There are many different types of medications available, and we can find one that works for you with minimal side effects. But let's not worry about that right now. Let's focus on getting the blood work and EKG done, and then we can discuss the results and make a plan together. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and an EKG first. And then we talk. That's good. How do I schedule those? And… will my insurance cover it? I have Medicare. I don't want any surprises, you know? Bills can be… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Of course. My assistant, Maria, will schedule the blood work and EKG for you before you leave. She will also verify your Medicare coverage. She's very good at handling insurance matters, so you shouldn't have to worry about any surprises. We're in-network with Medicare, so it should be covered. I’ll have her print out a list of instructions for the blood work, including whether you need to fast or not. And I’ll give you a referral slip for the EKG. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fasting... I should probably ask my sister about that, she's better at remembering things like that. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything really clearly. I feel… a little less worried now. I really appreciate you taking your time with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. It’s my job. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions between now and your follow-up appointment. Maria will get everything scheduled for you, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And if you need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out. Now, let me write up a summary for you and we'll head to the front desk. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfect, Doctor. Thank you again. I think I’m ready to face whatever comes next. And I’ll call my sister, she’ll be happy to know I’m actually doing something about this.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mykeisha. Maria will be with you shortly. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll get this sorted out. Take care, and have a good day.
