DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Gentz. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about my stomach. Been bleedin' a bit. Not a good time for it, honestly. Thought it'd just... stop, but it hasn't. And frankly, I haven't got time for this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bleeding is definitely something we need to look into. When you say “a bit,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: "A bit?" Look, lady, it's blood, alright? Comin' out where it shouldn't. How much more specific do you want me to be? It's not a trickle, if that's what you're askin'. It’s… noticeable. Enough to worry me, which, believe me, takes a lot. And it's been happenin' for, oh, three days now, maybe four. I lost track. It's all a blur, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, okay. Not a trickle, noticeable, and for about three or four days. Thank you for clarifying. Is it happening with every bowel movement, or is it more sporadic?
PATIENT: Sporadic? What is this, a quiz? Look, I don’t schedule my bathroom breaks, alright? It happens when it happens. But... yeah, usually with it. Most of the time. Sometimes just... there. It's not exactly somethin' I enjoy keepin' detailed records of, if you get my drift. Honestly, I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize if my questions seem detailed. It’s just important for me to get a clear picture of what's going on so we can find the best way to help. So, it's usually with bowel movements, but sometimes you notice it even when you’re not having one. Is the blood bright red, dark and tarry, or somewhere in between?
PATIENT: Tarry? Lady, I'm not a painter! It's... red. Usually kinda dark red, I guess. Not bright, like fresh cut, you know? More… old. Like it’s been… travelin’ a bit. Look, does the color really matter? It’s blood! Is that not enough information for you? I've dealt with worse, believe me. This whole thing is just a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Gentz, because the color can give us clues about where the bleeding is coming from. Darker red, like you described, suggests it's coming from higher up in the digestive tract. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bleeding?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm tired. I'm always tired. But that's just… life, you know? I'm not exactly spring chicken anymore. And I’ve been feelin’ a bit… weak, I suppose. But again, could be anything. Honestly, I’ve lost my appetite. Everything just tastes… off. And I've got this… ache. Low down. Stomach area. But it comes and goes. I haven't been sleepin' well either. Everything's just a mess, alright? A complete mess. But who needs sleep when you're dealin' with… this?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, an ache in your lower stomach, and trouble sleeping. Those are all things we need to consider. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, "changes?" I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom, alright? It's not exactly a complicated process. Look, maybe it's been a little… looser than usual. And maybe I'm goin' a bit more often. But that could be the food, or the stress, or… honestly, I don't know! Are we gonna sit here all day cataloging every single bodily function? I've got things to do, you know. Important things. This is just… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools and going more often. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like ulcers, Crohn’s disease, or colitis?
PATIENT: Medical history? Lady, I’m fifty-one years old. I’ve lived a life. I've had the usual bumps and bruises, a broken arm when I was a kid, the flu a few times. But diagnosed with… whatever those things are? No. Never. I'm a tough guy. Don't need doctors tellin' me what's wrong with me. Mostly, I just ignore things until they go away. Or… I deal with them myself. I've always been pretty good at takin' care of things. And frankly, I don't have the time or the money for a whole lot of fancy tests and diagnoses. It's a waste of resources, if you ask me. Though, I did lose my wife a few years back. A heart thing. That's about it, really. Nothing else worth mentionin'.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so no prior diagnoses, and just the broken arm and occasional flu. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. Not really. Well, there was that time I got that mole removed from my back, years ago. Small thing. Local anesthetic, in and out. And… I think I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was younger, but honestly, I barely remember it. It was a long time ago. Nothing major. No heart surgery, no nothing like that. I've always been lucky, I guess. Or tough. Take your pick. Mostly, I just try to avoid doctors as much as possible. They never have anything good to say. Though, I did get a tetanus shot a few years back when I stepped on a nail. Does that count? It was all very routine, nothing special. Though, my wife used to go to a doctor often. She had all sorts of aches and pains. I didn't understand it, frankly. But that's neither here nor there. Mostly, I'm a healthy guy. Or I was, before this whole stomach mess started. It's just… annoying, really. A waste of my time and energy. I've got things to do, you know? Important things. This is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mole removal and wisdom teeth extraction, and a tetanus shot. No major surgeries. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Look, my family's from Yemen, alright? We don't exactly keep detailed medical records. It's not exactly a priority when you're tryin' to survive. My father… he had a bad heart. That's about all I know. He died when I was young. And my mother… she had… aches and pains, I suppose. Old age, mostly. She lived a long life. As for my siblings… I have a few brothers, but we haven’t spoken in years. They probably have the usual problems. High blood pressure, maybe. Bad backs. Nothing serious. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to their health. It's not my concern, if you ask me. Mostly, we just try to avoid talkin’ about… things. It's easier that way. We're a practical people, you know? We deal with problems as they come, we don't sit around worryin’ about what might happen in the future. It's just… not how we do things. Frankly, I don't see what any of this has to do with my stomach bleedin’. Are you tryin’ to stall for time or somethin’? I’ve got things to do, you know. Important things. This is just… a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a detailed family history isn't available. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Lady, I barely have time to eat, let alone take a bunch of pills. No. Nothing. I don't believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense. I take care of myself, alright? I eat when I can, I sleep when I can, and I try to avoid stress as much as possible. That's all I need. I don't need doctors tellin’ me what to put in my body. I’ve got a strong constitution, you know? I can handle things myself. I might take an aspirin every now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. And even then, I don't really like it. It makes me feel… sluggish. I prefer to just tough it out, you know? That's what I've always done. I don't need all those fancy pills and potions. Honestly, I think they just make things worse. They're all just… chemicals, you know? Messin’ with your body. No. Nothing. I take absolutely no medications. And I don’t plan on startin’ now. This is just… ridiculous. Are we gettin’ anywhere, or are we just goin’ in circles? I’ve got things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications at all. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Seriously? Lady, I’ve lived fifty-one years, alright? If I was allergic to somethin’, I’d know it by now. No. None. I eat whatever I want, whenever I want. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little heartburn every now and then, but that’s just from eatin’ too much spicy food. That’s not an allergy, that’s just… life. I’ve never had a rash, never had trouble breathin’, never had any of those fancy allergy symptoms. I’m a tough guy, remember? I can handle anything. I’ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, and that includes food. I eat whatever I want, and I’ve never had a problem. I might sneeze a little sometimes, but that’s just the dust, alright? It’s a dusty world. No. None. I have absolutely no allergies. And frankly, I’m startin’ to get annoyed with all these questions. Are we gettin’ anywhere, or are we just wastin’ my time? I’ve got things to do, you know. Important things. This is just… a complete waste of my time. Honestly, I’m startin’ to think I should just go home and deal with this myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Alright, Mr. Gentz, I’m going to need to do a physical exam now. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also need to examine your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Examine my abdomen? Look, lady, I'm not here to be poked and prodded. I've already told you everything you need to know. I'm bleedin', alright? That's the problem. I don't need you listenin' to my heart and lungs, and I definitely don't need you touchin' my stomach. Frankly, it feels like you're just tryin' to stall for time, or maybe you don't believe me. I'm a grown man, I know my own body. I don't need a doctor tellin' me what's wrong with it. I'm starting to regret even comin' in here. This is a complete waste of my time. Honestly, I think I'm just gonna go home. This is ridiculous. But fine. If you absolutely must listen to my heart, go ahead. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And definitely don't touch my stomach. I'm warnin' you. I've got things to do, you know. Important things. This is just… unbelievable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable. However, as a doctor, it's my responsibility to gather as much information as possible to ensure I can provide you with the best possible care. Listening to your heart and lungs and examining your abdomen will help me assess your overall condition and rule out any other potential causes for your bleeding. It’s not that I don’t believe you, it’s simply part of the process. I will be as gentle as possible. May I please listen to your heart and lungs first?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But be quick about it, alright? And gentle, like you said. I don’t have all day. And don’t you go makin’ a face or somethin’. I can tell when a doctor thinks I’m bein’ ridiculous. Just listen, take your notes, and let’s get this over with. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. I’ve got things to do, you know. Important things. And if you find somethin’ wrong, don’t you go givin’ me a whole speech about how I should have come in sooner. I don’t need that. Just tell me what’s wrong, and let’s get it fixed. Quickly, now. I’m startin’ to get impatient. This is just… unbelievable.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a few deep breaths for me, Mr. Gentz. In… and out… Good. Your heart sounds… regular. I do hear a slight… wheeze in your lungs, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Your respiratory rate is a bit elevated, which could be due to the bleeding. Now, I am going to listen to your abdomen. I will start by gently pressing on it to feel for any tenderness or masses. Again, I will be as gentle as possible. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Hey! Easy there, alright? That's… sensitive. A bit tender, yeah. Not somethin' I enjoy havin' poked at, if you get my drift. It's… right about here. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s… swollen. I told you it was tender! Honestly, you’re makin’ it worse. Can you just tell me what's wrong already? This is ridiculous. I’ve got things to do, you know. Important things. And stop pressin’ so hard! It’s not exactly a pleasant experience havin’ a stranger dig around in my stomach. This is just… unbelievable. Are you sure you know what you’re doin’? Frankly, I’m startin’ to regret even comin’ in here. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Gentz. I didn’t mean to cause you any discomfort. You're right, that area is tender to the touch. I also notice some slight guarding – meaning your muscles are tensing up when I touch it, which suggests there’s some inflammation. No masses that I can feel at this moment. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it’s still unclear what’s causing the bleeding. Given the tenderness and guarding, we need to investigate further. I’m concerned about the possibility of an ulcer, gastritis, or possibly something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a stool test to look for any blood or signs of infection. I also recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the colon and rule out any other potential causes of the bleeding. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? A colonoscopy? Are you serious? Look, lady, I'm not about to let you stick a camera up my… never mind. I’m not doin’ that. Absolutely not. Blood tests, fine. Whatever. But no colonoscopy. No way. I told you, I'm not about to be poked and prodded and have a camera shoved up my… No. Just give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’, alright? That’s all I want. I don’t need a whole bunch of fancy tests. I've lived a long life, alright? If somethin’s wrong, it’s wrong. No need to make it worse with a whole bunch of unnecessary procedures. Frankly, this is ridiculous. Just give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’, and let me go home. I've got things to do, you know. Important things. This is a complete waste of my time. Honestly, I think I'm just gonna go home and deal with this myself. This is unbelievable. Are you even listenin’ to me?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz. A colonoscopy doesn’t sound pleasant, and I wouldn’t recommend it if it wasn’t important. However, given your symptoms – the bleeding, the tenderness, and the loss of appetite – it’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of the bleeding and rule out anything serious, like colon cancer. I want to be upfront with you. Without knowing the cause of the bleeding, I can’t simply give you something to stop it. That would be irresponsible. It could mask a more serious underlying condition, and we need to address that. I understand you're concerned about having procedures, but I want to assure you that it's the best course of action. If you're absolutely opposed to a colonoscopy, we could consider a stool test and possibly an endoscopy, which involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your stomach and duodenum. It’s less invasive than a colonoscopy, but it won’t visualize the entire colon. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: An endoscopy… fine. Whatever. Less invasive, you say? Alright, I suppose I could consider that. But that's it. No colonoscopy. Absolutely not. I'm not about to let you stick a camera up my… never mind. An endoscopy, and then you give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’, alright? That's my final offer. No more tests, no more procedures. Just fix the problem, and let me go home. I've got things to do, you know. Important things. This is ridiculous. Honestly, I think I'm startin' to regret even comin' in here. This is unbelievable. Are you even listenin' to me? And don’t you go givin' me a whole speech about how I should be gettin' regular checkups. I'm a grown man, I can take care of myself. Just fix the problem, and let me go home. That's all I want. This is a complete waste of my time. Frankly, I think I'm just gonna go home and deal with this myself. But fine. An endoscopy. But that's it. Absolutely no more.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, I understand. We will proceed with an endoscopy. I will order the necessary tests and a referral to a gastroenterologist who can perform the procedure. They will also be able to determine the best course of treatment to stop the bleeding. In the meantime, I can prescribe you an iron supplement to help with any potential anemia caused by the bleeding. I also recommend a bland diet – avoiding spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol – to minimize irritation to your stomach. I want to emphasize that while an endoscopy is a good step, it’s important to address the underlying cause of the bleeding to prevent it from happening again. I understand your hesitation, but I encourage you to consider following up with the gastroenterologist after the procedure to discuss any further testing or treatment options. Do you have any questions about the iron supplement or the bland diet?
PATIENT: Iron supplement… fine. Whatever. Bland diet… I suppose I can manage that. No spicy foods, you say? That’s gonna be tough, but I can try. Look, I'm not promisin' anything. If I feel like havin' a chili dog, I'm havin' a chili dog. But I'll try to be careful. Just get me the prescription for the iron, and let me go home. I've got things to do, you know. Important things. And don’t you go callin' me to remind me about follow-up appointments or anything. I'll deal with it. Or I won't. That's my decision. Just get me the prescription, and let me go home. Honestly, I think I'm just gonna forget about all this. This is unbelievable. Are you even listenin' to me? Just get me the prescription, and let me go home. This is a complete waste of my time. I'm done. Absolutely done. Just get me the prescription. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I have sent the prescription for the iron supplement to your pharmacy. It should be ready for pickup within a few hours. Here are some instructions on the bland diet, and potential side effects of the iron supplement. Please read them carefully. I understand you’re not interested in further follow-up at this time, and I respect your decision. However, I encourage you to reconsider if your symptoms worsen or don't improve. I hope you feel better soon, Mr. Gentz. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I’ll have the nurse come in to review the discharge instructions with you.
PATIENT: .
