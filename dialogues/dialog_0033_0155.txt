DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, she said. That’s… that’s what I’m here for. My hand, mostly. It shakes. Not all the time, but… enough to bother me. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started. Old age, probably. Is that what they think? I just want to get this sorted, if we can.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “old age” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Jezik. We need to determine the cause. How long have you noticed this tremor, approximately?
PATIENT: Approximately… That’s a hard one. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? Or was it eight? It comes and goes, see? Makes it tough to say. Not constant, thankfully. It’s worse when I… when I try to do something precise. Like, holding a cup of coffee. Or writing. Though I haven’t written much lately. My hands just… wobble. Is that a good way to describe it?
DOCTOR: “Wobble” is… descriptive. And does anything specifically trigger it, besides precise movements?
PATIENT: Hmm… now you’ve got me thinking. I don’t know. Stress, maybe? When I’m… agitated. Though I try not to get agitated. Makes things worse, doesn't it? And… sometimes when I’m cold. But it's not a definite thing. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’m sorry, I’m not much help, am I? It just… happens. And I try not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Medications? Not… not regularly. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor took me off it. Said it wasn't necessary. And… oh, sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think. Just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing fancy. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… nope, can’t say that I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything. Nothing I remember, anyway. I used to get stung by bees when I was a kid, working in the garden, but that just meant a bit of swelling. Nothing serious. I think I’m pretty sturdy, honestly. Still, it’s good to ask, I suppose. It’s just… hard to recall everything. I’m getting on, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, sometimes my hand feels a bit… stiff. Not always, just occasionally. And… I get tired easily, I suppose. But I am seventy-nine, Doctor. Aren't you supposed to get tired? It’s hard to say what's the tremor and what's just… getting old. I’m not sure I’m explaining this very well. And… no, can’t think of anything else right now. Hopefully.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a quick look. Please sit here, and I'll examine your hands and arms. Just relax. I’ll also want to check your reflexes and coordination.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax, you say? Easier said than done when someone’s poking and prodding. But alright, I'll try. Just… be gentle, would you? My bones aren’t what they used to be. Let’s get this over with, then. I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Now, keep them extended… good. I’m going to gently tap each of your knees. And now, can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: There we go. It’s harder than it looks, you know. Ow, a little tender there, Doctor. Hmm… getting trickier. It’s not as smooth as it used to be. My hand’s just… not cooperating today. Is that what you’re looking for? The wobbling?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, that's helpful. I’m noting some mild tremor at rest and with movement, and a slight decrease in coordination. Reflexes are… within normal limits, although a bit diminished. Given your age and these findings, it’s likely essential tremor. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test.
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Figures. More poking and prodding, and waiting around. Well, alright. If you think it's necessary. I just… don’t want a lot of fuss. I’m not one for hospitals and fancy equipment. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to come back here again? I was hoping to get this sorted today, if possible. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The lab work should be processed within a few days, Mr. Jezik. You’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. And to be clear, essential tremor isn’t curable, it’s managed. We can discuss options like medication or physical therapy, but they won’t eliminate the tremor entirely. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that appointment for you. For now, try to avoid activities that exacerbate the tremor, and if it becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, contact the office immediately.
PATIENT: Managed, you say? Well, that’s… not what I wanted to hear. Alright then. Schedule the appointment. I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? Just… try to make it as quick as possible, please. I have a garden to tend to, you know. And… thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. The receptionist will be in touch. Have a good day. .
