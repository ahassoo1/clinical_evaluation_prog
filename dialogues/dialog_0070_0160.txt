DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s just… this tiredness. It's getting worse, and frankly, it’s ridiculous. And this… this thing I’ve been craving. Dirt, you know? Not like a little bit, either. It’s embarrassing to even talk about. Just get this over with, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. It is unusual to experience cravings like that, and persistent fatigue is certainly concerning. We will get to the bottom of this, and I assure you, there’s no need to be embarrassed. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I suddenly can’t get out of bed, but… everything feels like a mountain. Even just walking to the mailbox. And it doesn’t go away with rest, not really. I used to be able to do things, you know? Garden, volunteer at the church… now? Forget it. And the dirt… it started a few months ago. Little bits at first, now… well, now I have to stop myself. It’s awful. I feel silly even saying it.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. It sounds distressing, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. The fact that rest isn't helping and this has been going on for months is important information. To clarify, when did you first notice the fatigue, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… around February, maybe March? Right after that awful cold snap we had. I thought it was just getting over the cold, you know? Old lady problems. But it just… never really lifted. It’s been steadily getting worse since then. And the dirt craving… started a little bit after that, maybe April. Does that make any sense? Honestly, keeping track of dates isn't my strong suit.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Hardenburgh. February or March with the fatigue, and April with the craving – that’s helpful. And don't worry about exact dates, we’ll sort through it. Now, regarding the fatigue, is it constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty constant, honestly. Worse in the mornings, definitely. Like getting out of cement shoes. I’ll drag myself out of bed, and it just… doesn’t get much better. Even after I’ve had my coffee. And afternoons are bad too. I find myself just… sitting. Watching TV. Which is unlike me. I used to be doing things all the time. But now? I just… don’t have the energy. It’s like something is sucking it out of me. And it's not just physical, if you know what I mean. It's… mentally draining, too.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it sounds like both physical and mental fatigue are present, and it’s been impacting your daily activities. It's good you've noticed this change. Now, let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite's been… off. Not that I’m not eating, just… not enjoying it as much. Everything tastes kind of… bland. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but truthfully, I don’t weigh myself regularly. I'm a small woman anyway. It's probably nothing, but my clothes do feel a little looser. Though, that could just be the fatigue making me feel… smaller, I suppose. I haven’t been out shopping for anything new in ages, so it’s hard to say for sure. And frankly, I don’t see the point. What’s the use?
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and a possible weight loss… It's helpful information, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's good you're paying attention to these changes, even if it feels difficult. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little… dizzy sometimes. Not falling-down dizzy, just a little lightheaded. And my hands… they feel cold a lot. Even when it's warm. I thought it was just old age creeping up on me, but maybe it’s something else? I haven't noticed anything else, really. Oh, wait! My skin feels dry. Really, really dry. Like sandpaper. I've been using lotion, but it doesn't seem to help much. And… now that I think about it, I get these little headaches sometimes. Nothing major, just a dull ache. But they're there. Is that helpful? I’m trying to think, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, that is very helpful. Dizziness, cold hands, dry skin, and headaches – these are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let's shift gears a bit. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. And I had a hysterectomy when I was 40, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I don’t take any regular medications. Just an occasional pain reliever for arthritis, when it flares up. And… oh! I had my gallbladder removed maybe ten years ago. But that's it. I’ve always been lucky, really. Until now, apparently. Honestly, I’m starting to worry. Is this something serious, doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good to know about the hysterectomy and gallbladder removal. And it’s positive you've been generally healthy. It’s understandable that you're worried, Ms. Hardenburgh, and it’s good you came in to get this checked out. Before we continue, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine without issue. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. Which is ironic, considering this… dirt craving, isn't it? Honestly, it’s embarrassing. And unsettling. I feel like something is wrong with my mind. Is this a… a psychological thing, doctor? I just want to be normal again. I really do.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you have no known allergies. And you're right, the craving is unusual and concerning. It’s very unlikely to be a psychological issue, though we can certainly consider all possibilities. This symptom, along with the others you’ve described, could point to a few different underlying causes. Now, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My mother had… well, she had high blood pressure, I think. And diabetes, later in life. My father… he died young, from a heart attack, I believe. That was ages ago. I don’t really know much about either of their families, honestly. They weren’t really talkative people. No one on either side had anything… strange, like this. No one craving dirt, or being constantly tired. Just… normal ailments. Old age problems, you know? That’s why this is so unsettling. I'm probably just getting old, aren't I? Please tell me I'm not going crazy.
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure and diabetes in your mother, and a heart attack in your father… that's helpful information. And it sounds like this is quite different from what your family has experienced, which is why it's understandably unsettling. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and frankly, I agree. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Not even a sip. Never had the taste for it. Always preferred a good cup of tea. And… well, I live alone. Always have. Worked as a physical therapist aide for years, but I had to retire a few months ago, because of this tiredness. It just got too much. I have a few friends at the church, but mostly I just keep to myself. Is that relevant, doctor? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: No, you are not wasting my time at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. All of this information is important. It helps me understand your overall health picture. And the fact that you’ve been generally healthy, worked as a physical therapist aide, and live an active social life – those are all positive things. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I don’t see how poking and prodding is going to help. But if you think it’s necessary… just be quick about it, alright? I have things to do, you know. Or I would have, if I wasn’t so tired. This whole thing is ridiculous. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. Please have a seat here on the table, and we'll begin. Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh, your blood pressure is 110/70, your pulse is 72 and regular, your respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are normal, but I did hear some mild crackles in your lungs, which we’ll want to investigate further. Your neurological assessment is also normal. I also noticed some mild paleness in your eyes and skin. Do you feel cold often?
PATIENT: Cold? Yes, actually. Like I said, my hands are always cold. Even when it’s warm. It's not a shivering cold, just… chilly. Always have to wear gloves, even in the summer sometimes. But I just thought it was old age. And what did you say about my lungs? Crackles? Is that… bad? Honestly, I don’t like the sound of that. You’re starting to worry me, doctor. Is this something serious? Am I going to die? Don't tell me I'm dying.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, please don't worry. Crackles in the lungs can be caused by a number of things, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. They could indicate fluid buildup, inflammation, or even just some congestion. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine the cause. Based on everything you’ve told me – the fatigue, the craving for dirt, the cold hands, the pallor, and the crackles in your lungs – I’m concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia. The craving for dirt – a condition called pica – is often a sign of severe iron deficiency. Anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and pallor, and it can sometimes lead to fluid buildup in the lungs. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count to check your red blood cell levels and iron levels. I also want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a chest X-ray? Honestly, it sounds awful. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. Just get it over with. I just want to know what's wrong with me. I've never been sick a day in my life, and now this? It's ridiculous. And this pica thing… is that dangerous? I read something online about lead poisoning. Is that what this is? Please tell me it's not lead poisoning. I just want to feel normal again, doctor. Just tell me what's wrong, and how to fix it. And make it quick, alright? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s good you brought up lead poisoning – it's important to rule out all possibilities. Pica can sometimes be associated with lead exposure, but it’s more often caused by iron deficiency. We’ll test for both, to be sure. Here is the requisition form for the blood tests and the order for the chest X-ray. You can have these done at the lab across the street. They'll draw a small sample of blood, and the X-ray technician will take an image of your chest. The results should be back within a few days. I will call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend trying to avoid consuming anything non-food, like dirt. I know it's difficult, but it could worsen the condition. And if you start to feel any new symptoms, like shortness of breath or chest pain, please call my office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the results back quickly. And tell me what to do. I just want this to be over. Honestly, this whole thing is… unsettling. Dirt, doctor. Dirt. It’s ridiculous. I suppose… no, I don't have any questions. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will expedite the results as quickly as possible. We’ll figure this out, and we’ll get you feeling better. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns in the meantime. Here’s my card. Thank you for coming in today. I will be in touch soon. Have a good day, despite everything. And try to rest.
