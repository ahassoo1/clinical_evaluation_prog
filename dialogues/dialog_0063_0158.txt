DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I am Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's about this… letter. For a pet, you see? I need a letter saying I’m… capable, I guess, of owning one. Some building thing. It’s really quite silly, if you ask me. People having pets these days…
DOCTOR: A letter…for pet ownership. Right. I see. While I am a physician, and can provide medical documentation, this isn’t…precisely within the scope of my practice. However, to fulfill your request—and quickly, I assure you—I’ll need some information. Do you have any relevant medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history? Heavens, where do I begin? I mean, I’ve lived, Doctor. Things happen. I think… I had the flu once, a bad one. And a sprained ankle years ago, dancing. But seriously, is that what you need for a dog? Honestly, the world is going mad. I don't recall anything major… nothing that would stop me from, you know, walking a poodle.
DOCTOR: "Walking a poodle," yes. Well, Ms. Wrye, a responsible pet owner should be reasonably healthy, capable of providing care. It’s…common sense. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. Oh! I take something for… well, my knees. They ache sometimes, you know, getting older. But it’s nothing regular, really. Just when they bother me. I get it from… the pharmacy, of course. The blue bottle. What is the name of it again? It's on the tip of my tongue… It helps with the ache, that’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: "Something for the knees, as needed." Right. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergic… Now, that’s a good question. I haven’t really… paid attention, if I'm honest. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… dust? Sometimes I sneeze. But is that an allergy? I suppose I’m not one for fancy foods or anything. Stick to simple things, you see. No shellfish or anything complicated. Does that count? I really don't know what I'm allergic to, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Just to be thorough, naturally. Could you please step onto the scale?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! Must we? I mean, it's not as if a few pounds will stop me from scooping… well, you know. But fine. Don't tell me the number, though. I prefer not to know. It’s all very… uncouth.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure, then. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just to be certain everything is functioning adequately. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, please do. I always feel a bit… constricted with those things. Are you quite sure this is necessary for a pet? It just seems like a lot of fuss, honestly. Back in my day, you just got a pet. No letters, no examinations… People these days…
DOCTOR: Hmm. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not concerning, given your…discomfort. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Very well. Given the limited information and your…adequate physical condition, I can provide a letter stating you are physically capable of responsible pet ownership. However, I strongly advise regular exercise and a healthy diet. It's simply good practice, regardless of animal companionship.
PATIENT: Oh, excellent! That’s all I needed, really. A bit of paperwork, that’s all. And yes, yes, regular exercise, of course. I walk. Sometimes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been…efficient. How much do I owe you? And could I have the letter printed quickly? The building manager is rather… insistent.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Wrye. The fee is $150, standard consultation rate. I must reiterate that this letter is based solely on the information you have provided and a brief physical examination. Any underlying health conditions remain your responsibility. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: $150? For a letter? Honestly, Doctor! Fine, fine. Here. Well, it says what it needs to say, I suppose. Thank you. Though I still think the whole thing is rather ridiculous. Good day, Doctor. .
