DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet ya. Seems my blood pressure’s been a little high, been told to come get it checked out. Old age, I reckon. Mostly just want to get this sorted so I can get back to my bakin’.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It's good you’re being proactive about this, Ms. Steines. High blood pressure is common, and we can definitely work to get it managed so you can continue enjoying your baking. To start, could you tell me a little more about when you were told your blood pressure was high?
PATIENT: Oh, land… let me think. It was… about a month ago, maybe a little more. Went to see Mabel down at the pharmacy – she does free checkups sometimes. She said it was a bit up, told me to see a real doctor. Didn’t really bother me too much at the time, but then my daughter, Carol, started fussin’ about it. She’s a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you have a daughter who cares and looks out for you, Ms. Steines. And Mabel is a wonderful resource. Do you happen to remember what your blood pressure reading was at the pharmacy, if she told you?
PATIENT: Shoot, no, I don’t rightly recall the numbers. Numbers ain’t my best friend, never have been. She just said it was “elevated” and I needed to get it checked. I remember her makin’ a face, like it was somethin’ serious.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Steines, don’t worry about the exact numbers. We’ll get a reading here today. Have you been experiencing any symptoms along with this – things like headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but that's just gettin' old, I suppose. And my knees ache, but they always do. No headaches or dizziness or nothin' like that. I can still see just fine for readin' my recipes, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And it's perfectly normal to feel a bit more tired as we age. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh, years and years ago, the doctor said somethin' about my cholesterol bein' a little high, but he put me on some pills for a while and I stopped takin' 'em after a bit. Didn't seem to make much difference and I didn’t like takin' so many pills. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And we can certainly discuss your concerns about medications if we do decide some are needed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hm... Let's see. Years ago, when I was younger, I had my gallbladder taken out. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist fallin' off a ladder pickin' peaches. Other than that, not much. Mostly just the usual little things, a bad cold here and there.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist. Thank you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, what the doctor told me to do after a little scare with my heart a while back. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my knees when they’re really botherin’ me, but it’s just one of them over-the-counter things – I can’t recall the name right off. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Alright, baby aspirin daily and an over-the-counter medication for your knees as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin’. I eat pretty much anything. My mama always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, lord, family history… Well, my mama lived to be 95, bless her heart. She had a little bit of everything, I reckon, but she was tough as nails. My daddy died young, heart trouble, I think. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, too, before he passed. Seems to run in the family, this blood pressure business.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Steines. It's helpful to know about your family history, especially with your brother having high blood pressure. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just gettin' this sorted out would be a blessin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start by taking your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is reading 158 over 92. That is elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not concerning at this moment, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. And your pulse is 78 and regular. I'm also noting your weight as 85 pounds and height as 190 centimeters.
PATIENT: Goodness, those numbers… are they bad? I don’t rightly understand all that. A murmur, you say? Is that serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Steines. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear medical terms you don’t understand. The blood pressure reading of 158 over 92 is higher than we’d like. Ideally, we want to keep it below 130 over 80. The murmur I heard is a slight extra sound when your heart beats. It’s common in people as you get older, and often harmless, but it's something we'll monitor. Based on what you've told me, your history, and this initial exam, it seems like we need to address your blood pressure. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. This will help us check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your high blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Well, I don't like needles, but if you think it's best… I reckon I can handle it. Just get this sorted out, that's all I want. And I want to keep bakin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Ms. Steines. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. And absolutely, getting you back to baking is our goal. The blood tests are fairly routine. We'll check your kidney function, electrolytes, a complete blood count, and your cholesterol levels. I’ll also order a basic metabolic panel. I’ll write you a lab order now, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. They are located just down the street, and you don't need an appointment. In the meantime, let’s discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure. These include reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. Do you think you’d be open to discussing those things?
PATIENT: Yeah, I suppose I can try. Salt... I do like a bit of salt on my tomatoes, I gotta admit. And walkin' ain't easy with these knees, but I can try a little bit. I eat pretty healthy, mostly, lots of vegetables from my garden. Tell me what you think I should do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s great that you already eat a lot of vegetables, Ms. Steines. That’s a wonderful start. Regarding salt, it's often hidden in processed foods, so try to limit those as much as possible. Reading labels is key. The pamphlet has a list of low-sodium alternatives. As for exercise, we don’t need to start with anything strenuous. Even 10-15 minutes of walking each day can be beneficial. If your knees are bothering you, consider water aerobics or gentle stretching. We can also talk about pain management options for your knees if that would be helpful. I also want to discuss medication. Based on your blood pressure reading and family history, it's likely we'll need to start you on a low dose of medication to help get it under control. We can start with a low dose and monitor your response. Are you comfortable discussing medication options?
PATIENT: Medication... I don't know, Doctor. I really don't like takin' pills. Makes me feel funny, and I worry about side effects. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't we just try the walkin' and the salt thing for a while first?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Steines. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about medication, and I wouldn’t push you into anything you’re not comfortable with. We can certainly try the lifestyle modifications – walking and reducing salt intake – for a few weeks and see how your blood pressure responds. However, given your reading today and your family history, it’s important to be realistic. Sometimes, lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough, and medication is needed to prevent complications like heart attack or stroke. If we try the lifestyle changes first, I'd like to see you back in two weeks to recheck your blood pressure. If it hasn’t come down sufficiently, we can then discuss medication options in more detail. We can choose a medication with minimal side effects and start with the lowest possible dose. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Two weeks, then. Alright, that sounds… alright. I can try the walkin’ and the salt thing. But I’m tellin’ ya, Doctor, I like my salt. So, what do I need to do about these blood tests? Where do I go? And what do I tell 'em?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good plan, Ms. Steines. And I understand about the salt – small changes can make a big difference. For the blood tests, I’ve already written you a lab order. Here it is. You'll take this to the lab at 123 Main Street. It’s just down the street, about a five-minute drive. You don’t need an appointment. When you get there, just tell the receptionist you have a blood order from Dr. Glowka. They’ll handle everything from there. You’ll need to provide your insurance information, and then they’ll draw a few vials of blood. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just go to the lab with this paper. And then come back in two weeks. Alright. Seems simple enough. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old woman. I reckon I'll be goin' now. And I'm gonna try and walk a little bit after I get home. Maybe just around the garden.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Steines. It was my pleasure meeting you. Remember, small steps are key. Don’t push yourself too hard with the walking, and focus on making small changes to your diet. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s the number. We’ll see you in two weeks. Take care and enjoy your baking! .
