DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… this tiredness. Just so tired all the time. Been going on a while now. Not like normal tired, you know? Like… heavy tired. And the other doctor, he said something about my liver. Not a good thing, that liver.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy tired,” I understand. And the other doctor mentioned your liver… alright. Let's try to get a better picture of this tiredness. When did you first start noticing this, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… after the rains, I think. Last fall, maybe? Yes, after the big rains. Everything was wet, and then… then I started feeling it. Not right away, but slowly. It just got worse and worse, you see? It's… annoying, mostly. Makes doing things… hard.
DOCTOR: After the rains, last fall… okay. And you said it's been gradually worsening. Can you describe what you mean by "heavy tired"?
PATIENT: It's not like… after a hard day of work, you know? I rest, I sleep… but it doesn't help. It's like… there's a weight. On my arms, on my legs… even my head sometimes. Everything feels… slow. And I just… don't want to do things. Not even things I used to like. It's… a bother, really. A big bother. People should be able to feel good, shouldn't they?
DOCTOR: Yes, people absolutely should feel good. That sounds very difficult, Mr. Grumman. This feeling of weight and lack of motivation… alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my stomach… it’s been funny. Sometimes it hurts, a dull ache. And… I don't eat like I used to. Food doesn’t… taste the same. Not as good. My wife, she keeps telling me I need to eat more. But it's… hard to make myself. And I've been a little… yellow, she says. Not much, but she notices everything, that woman. Says my eyes look funny too. Does that make sense? I don't know much about… bodies.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Stomach pain, loss of appetite, and your wife mentioning some yellowing… Okay. Let's take a look at your eyes and abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Look all you want. Don't expect much though. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Not much to see. Just… get it over with, quickly if you can. I have things to do, you know. Even if I don’t feel like doing them.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Grumman. Just a quick exam. If you could lie back for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be gentle. These old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just checking for tenderness, and listening to your stomach. Your abdomen is…soft, with some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And yes, I do notice some slight yellowing of the sclera – the whites of your eyes. Your liver feels… enlarged. I'm also hearing normal bowel sounds. Okay. This is consistent with what you and your wife have described. I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your liver function. We’ll also check your complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever you need to do. But don't expect miracles. I've had doctors before. They poke, they prod, they ask questions… and nothing ever changes. Still tired, still achey. Still a bother. But… go ahead, do your tests. Just… hurry. And tell me what it means, in plain English. No fancy doctor words, understand? Just… simple. Like you’re talking to a child.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Grumman. I’ll explain everything in plain English, as simply as possible. We’ll check a few things in your blood that will help us see how well your liver is working and rule out other possible causes for your tiredness. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. After the tests, we'll discuss the results and decide on the next steps. I want to assure you, we'll try to figure out what’s causing this and get you feeling better. Here’s the form for the lab. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And don’t waste my time. I have things to do, remember? Even if I don’t feel like doing them. .
