DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Aslan, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, nice to meet you too, Doctor Donato. Well, I’ve been having these…chills, on and off, for a couple of days now. It's a bit strange.
DOCTOR: Chills, okay. And how long exactly has it been a “couple of days”?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I guess it started on Saturday? So, three days, maybe? It’s not constant, like I don’t have them all the time, but they come and go throughout the day. It’s just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, three days, intermittent chills. And are these chills accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I've been feeling really tired, just…wiped out. And I think I had a bit of a headache yesterday, but it wasn't too bad. Oh, and my muscles feel a little achy, like I’ve been doing a workout or something, but I haven’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, headache, and muscle aches along with the chills. Have you taken your temperature at all?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I didn't even think to, to be honest. I just figured it was…I don’t know…a little bug or something? Should I have? I don’t really get sick often.
DOCTOR: It's always good to check. While it may be nothing, a fever can give us a better idea of what’s going on. Do you have a thermometer at home?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so… somewhere. Let me think… I think it's in the bathroom cabinet, but my ex left a lot of stuff when we split, so it might be buried. It's probably one of those digital ones.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, since you don't have a recent temperature reading, I'm going to take one for you now. Let's start with that. If you could just have a seat here, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Hopefully it's nothing serious!
DOCTOR: Alright, your temperature is 100.8 Fahrenheit. A little elevated. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam to see if we can narrow things down. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. 100.8… okay. I usually run a little cool, so that is higher than normal for me. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, lungs sound clear. Heart rate is normal. Lymph nodes are a little tender, but not significantly enlarged. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Oh! I've been a little bit thirsty, more so than usual. And I guess I haven’t had much of an appetite the last couple of days. Not completely gone, but definitely not as hungry as I normally am. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: Thirst and decreased appetite... okay. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no nausea or vomiting. Just… not feeling like eating much. I made myself a sandwich yesterday, but I only managed a few bites. It just didn’t taste good, you know? Not because it wasn’t good, just… I didn’t feel like it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, um… no. Everything’s… normal there, if you don’t mind me being blunt. Sorry!
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. I have to ask. Now, have you been around anyone else who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. My neighbor’s kid was coughing a lot last week, but I didn’t have much contact with him, just waved from across the yard. And my coworker, Sarah, said she had a bad cold last month, but that was ages ago. I don’t think that's relevant.
DOCTOR: It’s always good to ask. Based on what you’ve told me, and the slight fever, it sounds like you likely have a mild viral infection – probably a common cold or the flu. However, given the muscle aches and fatigue, we should rule out a few other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to be on the safe side. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, definitely. Bloodwork is fine. Is it going to be a lot of poking around? I'm not great with needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's just a standard blood draw, Ms. Aslan. A quick pinch. The phlebotomist is very good. We’ll just need a few vials. It shouldn't be too bad. While we wait for the results, I recommend plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the fever and aches. And if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a high fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Understand?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… doable. Rest, fluids, and pain relievers. I can definitely manage that. And I'll keep an eye out for those other symptoms, definitely. A pinch, you say? Alright. When do I need to go get the bloodwork done?
DOCTOR: There's a lab right across the street. Here's a requisition form. Just take this to the front desk and they’ll get you set up. They are open until 5 PM today. I'll have the results back tomorrow morning, and we can discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Donato. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just brush it off as nothing. I'll head over to the lab now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest, Ms. Aslan. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thanks again.
