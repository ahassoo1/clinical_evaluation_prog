DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been giving me trouble when I try to lie flat. It feels like I can’t get enough air. I don’t like it one bit.
DOCTOR: I see. Trouble breathing when lying flat, that’s concerning. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I sleep with two pillows now. Used to just be one, you know? But one wasn’t enough anymore. If I try to lie completely flat… it feels like something is… pressing on my chest. It’s hard to explain. Not painful, exactly, just… difficult. And it wakes me up.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you’ve increased the number of pillows you use to help with the breathing difficulty when lying down. And it’s not a pain so much as a sensation of pressure, and it’s disrupting your sleep. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t overnight. Maybe… three months ago I started noticing it a little. Not enough to worry about right away. But it’s gotten worse each month. Now it’s really bothering me. I haven’t told anyone else about it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months of gradual worsening. And you haven’t discussed this with anyone previously. Besides the difficulty lying flat, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I do get a little tired during the day. More tired than usual, I suppose. I always liked to garden, but I’ve been… resting more. Not doing as much. And sometimes my ankles feel a little swollen, but I thought that was just the heat. It has been a hot summer.
DOCTOR: I see. Increased fatigue and some ankle swelling. The swelling could be related to the heat, as you mentioned, but we'll want to consider everything. Have you noticed any swelling in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: No, just my ankles. And it comes and goes. Some days they're fine, some days they're puffier. I don't wear tight shoes, if that makes a difference. I try to keep things comfortable. I mostly wear sandals now, if it's warm enough.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Sandals and avoiding tight shoes is helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t like the way it made me feel. And… I had a bad flu a couple of winters ago, pneumonia, I think it was. But that's about it. Nothing else that I can recall. I’m usually a healthy woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure for which you previously took medication, and a bout of pneumonia a few years ago. Do you remember the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don't. It was a little white pill. I really don’t remember the name. The doctor told me what it was, of course, but I never was good at remembering things like that. It made me feel… dizzy. That’s why I stopped. I told the doctor, and he didn’t push it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to have trouble remembering medication names. Diziness is a good reason to discontinue a medication, and it's good that you discussed it with your doctor at the time. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for other reasons?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. Just that pneumonia, and I wasn't in the hospital long. A few days, maybe. My daughter took care of me at home mostly. She's a good girl. Always looking after me. I haven't needed to be hospitalized for anything else, thankfully. I try to stay out of doctors’ offices as much as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, lung problems, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… arthritis, I think it was. Bad in her hands. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when I was young. My brother is still alive, he's older than me, but he’s always been healthy. That’s all I really know. My family wasn't one for talking about medical things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and a weak heart in your father. And you mentioned your brother is currently healthy. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now. My husband passed away… oh, it's been fifteen years. I keep busy, though. I like to read, and I used to garden a lot more. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that’s it. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and lean meats. But I do like my sweets sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful information. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. I'm almost done telling you everything, aren’t I? I hope we can figure out what’s going on. This breathing is really worrisome.
DOCTOR: Yes, you've given me a lot of valuable information, Ms. Vanderwiele. Thank you. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have an appointment with the hairdresser this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late. But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. I'm hearing some mild crackles in the lower part of your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. I'll also listen to your heart rate and rhythm. It's a bit fast, at 92 beats per minute, and regular. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 160/90. That’s elevated. I’m going to check your pulse oximetry to see how well your oxygen levels are. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within normal limits. Now I will check your ankles for swelling. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Finally, I will palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal there.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a lot of things. Crackles… and a fast heart… and high blood pressure. I knew something wasn’t right. Is it serious, Doctor? What does it mean? I don't understand all of this medical talk. Is it my heart? I haven't been feeling much pain, though. Just… tired and short of breath.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Vanderwiele. It is a lot of information, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let me explain it in simpler terms. The crackles in your lungs suggest there may be some fluid buildup, which could be contributing to your shortness of breath. The elevated blood pressure could be putting extra strain on your heart, and the fast heart rate is likely a response to that. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it’s possible this is related to congestive heart failure, where the heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm that diagnosis. The absence of pain doesn’t rule anything out; many people with heart conditions don’t experience chest pain. I want to order a few tests. First, an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. Second, a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. And finally, a blood test called a BNP, which can help us determine if there’s strain on your heart. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests… oh dear. More tests. Well, if it will help figure out what’s going on, I suppose. Yes, alright. Do what you need to do. I just want to feel better. When will I get the results? And will it take long? I do have that hair appointment, you know. Hopefully, I won’t be too tired to get it done. Is it going to be expensive? I'm on a fixed income, and… well, it worries me. I have Medicare, though, right? That should cover some of it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn't take more than an hour or so to complete them. I'll have the results back to me by the end of the day, and I will personally call you with the findings. Regarding the cost, you have Medicare, which will cover a significant portion of these tests. There may be a co-pay or deductible, depending on your specific plan, but our billing department can provide you with a clear breakdown of the costs before you leave. I will have them speak with you before you leave to answer all your questions. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend limiting your salt intake, as that can contribute to fluid retention. Also, please monitor your weight daily and let us know if you notice any sudden increases. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Salt… limiting salt. That will be hard. I like my food seasoned, you know? But alright, I'll try. And monitoring my weight… yes, I can do that. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just… please call me as soon as you get the results. I'm anxious, you see. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for not making me feel… silly. It’s just… scary, not knowing. I suppose I will go have those tests now then? Should I wear anything special? Or can I just go as I am?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand your anxiety, and I will certainly call you as soon as I have the results. You don’t need to wear anything special for the tests. Just as you are is perfectly fine. The nurse, Sarah, will escort you to the lab and explain the process. She’s just outside the door now. She'll be happy to answer any questions you may have along the way. Please don't hesitate to call the office if anything changes or you develop any new symptoms before I call you with the results. I want to assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. Do you have any difficulty walking or need assistance getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can walk just fine. A little slow, perhaps, but I don't need any assistance. Sarah, you say? Alright. I suppose I’ll go find her then. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
