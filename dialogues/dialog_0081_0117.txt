DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh…cough. Yeah, I been coughin'. And…there's stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. I smoke, you know. Always have. Not tryin’ to make excuses. Just…tellin’ you.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough, and you're noticing some…red blood when you cough. How long has this cough been going on?
PATIENT: Long? Gosh… a while. Weeks, maybe? Months? It comes and goes. Hard to say, really. I…don’t keep track of things like that. It's been worse lately, that’s for sure. That's why I came in. Didn’t want to ignore it too long.
DOCTOR: Weeks to months, and worsening recently. Hmm. And is this cough productive at all – meaning, do you bring up any mucus or phlegm when you cough, besides the blood?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I cough stuff up. Always have. White stuff, mostly. Sometimes…yellow. Now that I think about it. But…mostly white. And, like I said, blood mixed in now and then. Not a lot. Just…enough to worry me. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: White and yellow mucus, and intermittent blood. Well, any blood with a cough warrants investigation, Mr. Reyno. Let's get a more detailed history. Do you experience any chest pain with this cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Not…really. Sometimes feels a little tight, maybe? Like a…soreness. But not pain. Not like a sharp pain, or anything. Just…uncomfortable. And sometimes when I really cough hard, it hurts my ribs. But I think that’s just from the coughin’ itself. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A tightness, not sharp pain, and rib soreness with forceful coughing. Understandable. Do you have any shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, associated with this cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath... Not…all the time. But…when I walk up hills, yeah. Or try to carry somethin’ heavy. I gotta stop and catch my breath. I just thought I was gettin' old. It's happened before.
DOCTOR: Naturally, some decline is expected with age. But shortness of breath with exertion, combined with the other symptoms, requires us to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I know of. Chills…sometimes I get cold, but…I live in the desert, you know? It gets cold at night. Weight loss…maybe? My clothes feel a little looser, but…I haven’t been weighin’ myself. I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. It all feels kinda the same to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Uh… Doc told me somethin’ once…about my blood pressure. Said it was a little high. But he gave me a pill. I take it. Sometimes. Medicare pays for it, I think. That’s all I really remember. Don’t really have anything else. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. Or, I thought I was.
DOCTOR: You're on medication for high blood pressure, sometimes. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: No. Nope. Don't remember nothin' about it. Little white pill. That's all I know. They send it to me in the mail. I take it when I remember. Look, I don't do good with rememberin' names. Never have.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me see what's listed here…Ah. Lisinopril. You're prescribed Lisinopril. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Lisinopril...sounds familiar, maybe. Surgeries? No. Not that I remember. Hospital… I broke my arm when I was a kid. Does that count? A long time ago. They put a cast on it. That's all I got. Been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: A childhood broken arm. Alright. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… You mean…my mom and dad? They're…gone. A long time ago. I don’t really know much about what they had. They didn't talk about things like that. I got a sister, somewhere. Haven't seen her in years. Never really talked about health stuff with her either. I don't know anything about family history. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? You gotta be kiddin’ me. I just told you I smoke! Been smokin’ since I was eighteen. Always have. Marlboro Reds. That’s what I smoke. And…I have a beer now and then. When I watch the ball game. That’s it. Never touched nothin’ else.
DOCTOR: Yes, you mentioned smoking. I was inquiring about the quantity. How many packs a day?
PATIENT: Oh. Quantity… uh… a pack a day, usually. Sometimes two if I'm stressed. Don't judge me. It's a bad habit, I know. I've been tryin' to quit for years. Doesn't work.
DOCTOR: Right. A pack a day, sometimes two. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and feel your abdomen. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I got things to do. Hurry it up, will ya?
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath... and again. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, but regular rhythm. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, Mr. Reyno. And your respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Now, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check your white blood cell count and oxygen levels. Would you be able to go to the imaging center down the street?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? That sounds…expensive. Will Medicare cover that? And…I don’t like needles. Can’t we just…do somethin' else? Maybe some medicine?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, an X-ray and blood test are necessary to determine the cause of your cough and wheezing. Medicare should cover it, but we can verify that. As for the blood test, it's a small discomfort for potentially important information. We need to rule out serious possibilities. I will write you a referral for the imaging center and a lab requisition. They can draw a small sample of blood. It’s a standard procedure. I will also prescribe an inhaler to help with the wheezing, but that’s just to manage symptoms, not treat the underlying cause. Here are the referrals. Please schedule these appointments as soon as possible. If you develop a high fever, shortness of breath at rest, or severe chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah. Okay. Emergency room… wheezing… inhaler… Sounds like a lot. Fine. I’ll…I’ll go get it done. Just…want to get this over with. Thanks, Doc. I guess. I think. Is it okay if I just…leave now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Reyno, you may leave. Please follow up with me once you have the results of the X-ray and blood test. Don’t delay. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
