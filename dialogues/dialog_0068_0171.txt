DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Sham. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Umm... hi. My nails. They look... funny. I don't really know why I'm here, to be honest. Just… they don’t look right. They always look alright, but now... not so much. It’s been a little while, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Nails don’t look right…” Could you describe what’s different about them?
PATIENT: Different... well, they're kinda... stripey. And a little thick, maybe? Not all of them, just some. I don't know, like… old lady nails. Not that there's anything wrong with old lady nails, but… mine never used to be like that. I just noticed it a few days ago, I think. Or was it a week? Time just... goes.
DOCTOR: Stripey and thicker… a few days to a week… Alright. And have you noticed any pain, redness, or swelling around the nails, or any changes to the skin around them?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don’t hurt hurt. Maybe a little… tender if I catch 'em on somethin'. No redness. No puffiness either. I keep 'em pretty short, so they don’t really get caught on things too much. I mostly just noticed they look bad. Is that… a real problem? I mean, can nails just look bad?
DOCTOR: It can be a real problem, Ms. Thut, but it doesn't necessarily mean it is. Changes in nails can sometimes indicate underlying health issues, or they could be something simple like a fungal infection, or even just a minor injury. Let's take a closer look, if you don't mind. Would you be comfortable letting me examine your hands and nails?
PATIENT: Ugh, examine? You mean… touch 'em? I don't know... I just washed 'em. I don't really like people touchin’ my hands. Is there any other way? I mean, can't you just… look at 'em? I don't think I have any fungus or anything. I keep 'em clean, I do. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Thut. While I can certainly look at them, a proper examination – feeling the texture and looking at the nail bed – is really the best way to get a sense of what's going on. It's difficult to diagnose anything accurately just by sight. But, we can do a limited exam, if that makes you more comfortable. I'll wear gloves, of course, and be as gentle as possible. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Gloves… okay, that’s better. I guess. Just… don’t poke around too much, alright? And don’t think nothin' of it if they’re a little rough. I do a lot of… things. With my hands. Not that it matters. Just… gloves. And gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, gentle with gloves. I understand. Now, could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Be careful, now. I just got a new lotion yesterday, so they're kinda slippery. It smells like peaches. Not that you need to know that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m looking at the nails now... I do notice some longitudinal striations – those are the lines running the length of the nails – on several digits. They appear to be somewhat irregular in color and width. And yes, the nails do feel slightly thickened, particularly on the third and fifth digits of your left hand. No pitting or crumbling that I can see at first glance. And the nail beds themselves appear…normal in color, no discoloration. No obvious signs of infection, but it's difficult to say for sure without a closer look. Do you have any other health concerns?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Ugh. What kind of question is that? I'm old, everyone has health concerns! My knees ache sometimes, I get a little…forgetful, as you can probably tell, and my back goes out if I bend over wrong. But what does that have to do with my nails? I just want to know if they look okay, or if I need to worry about something. Are they gonna fall off or something? People lose nails, don’t they?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about that. Nail changes can sometimes be related to underlying health issues. Things like arthritis, thyroid problems, or even nutritional deficiencies can affect nail health. And yes, nails can sometimes fall off, but that's usually related to trauma or infection, and doesn't seem likely in your case. The longitudinal striations are the most concerning finding here, and it's difficult to determine the cause without further investigation. We can order some blood work to check for common deficiencies and thyroid function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Ugh, needles. I hate needles. Is there any other way? I mean, can’t you just… give me a cream or somethin'? I don't like goin' to labs and gettin' poked and prodded. And what if it shows somethin’ bad? I don’t need to know about all my old lady problems, alright? I just want my nails to look normal. Is there a cream for normal?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Thut. Unfortunately, there isn’t a cream to “fix” nail changes without knowing the cause. And while I certainly don’t want to cause you unnecessary anxiety, knowing the cause is important, as some underlying conditions do require treatment. We could start with a simple iron level test, as iron deficiency is a common cause of nail changes, and it’s a relatively straightforward test. It might give us some answers without a lot of extensive blood work. And if that comes back normal, we can discuss other options. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Iron… okay, that sounds… less bad. Just a little poke, right? Not a whole bunch of vials and stuff? And if it's normal, then you promise you won’t make me do more? I just want to be done with this. My nails are the only thing I ever really pay attention to, and now they're… stripey. It's very upsetting. Okay, fine. Iron. Let's just get it over with. Do I need to fast or anything? I had a peach cobbler for breakfast. A really good one.
DOCTOR: Alright, just an iron level test. No, you don't need to fast, so the peach cobbler is fine. We'll just need a small sample of blood from your arm. It’s a quick procedure. I’ll write you a referral to the lab down the street. They should be able to get you in today. After the results come back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. A referral. Fine. Just… try not to scare me when I come back, alright? And don't tell me I have something awful. I just want my nails to look normal. Is that too much to ask? Peach cobbler, normal nails… that’s all I want. Okay, I think I’m ready to go. Is there anything else? I have a bingo game to get to. And it starts soon.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Thut, that’s all for today. We'll go from there when the results come back. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. Enjoy your bingo game, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s my card.
