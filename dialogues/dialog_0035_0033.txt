DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, honestly, I don't have a great deal of time for this. It’s… it’s my sight and hearing. They’ve been… diminishing. Rather suddenly, I might add. It's most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you're concerned about changes in your vision and hearing, and that it’s happening quickly. “Diminishing” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, dates… they all blur together after a while. It was… relatively recently. Perhaps a week? A little more? It’s difficult to say. I simply woke up one morning and things weren’t as… clear. And the sounds… muffled. It's not as if I spend my days meticulously documenting the precise moment my faculties began to fail. I have a practice to run, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s hard to pinpoint exact dates when you're busy. So, within the last couple of weeks, you've noticed both your vision and hearing have been getting worse. Is it affecting your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Of course it is! I’m a surgeon, Doctor. A pediatric surgeon. Precision is paramount. I can barely make out the details on my charts anymore, and discerning a child’s heartbeat… well, let’s just say it's becoming increasingly challenging. I had to ask young Dr. Ramirez to double-check my work yesterday. Mortifying.
DOCTOR: That is concerning, especially given your profession. Okay, so you've noticed difficulty with close-up vision and hearing subtle sounds. Has the vision change been gradual, or more sudden?
PATIENT: Sudden, Doctor. Definitely sudden. One day, perfectly acceptable vision, the next… blurry. It wasn’t a slow fading, if that’s what you're asking. And the hearing… the same. It’s not as if I’ve been gradually going deaf for years. It’s quite… alarming, actually. Frankly, I expect a swift resolution to this matter. I haven’t the patience for prolonged investigations.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sudden changes in both vision and hearing are definitely something we need to investigate. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Am I supposed to be cataloging every minor discomfort? No, Doctor, nothing else particularly noteworthy. A bit of fatigue, perhaps, but that’s to be expected. Running a hospital, as I said, is rather taxing. I don't have time for a full body inventory. I simply want my sight and hearing restored. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. And I apologize if my questions seem thorough, Ms. Julie. We just want to make sure we cover all possibilities. Fatigue can sometimes be related. Have you had any headaches, dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you're beginning to sound like one of those… holistic practitioners. Headaches, dizziness… occasionally. Who doesn't have those? The ringing… yes, a slight tinnitus, now that you mention it. It’s barely noticeable. And balance… I haven’t tripped over anything lately, if that’s what you’re implying. Really, I’m a very stable individual. I'd appreciate it if we could focus on the actual problem, rather than delving into my general wellbeing. I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, recent sudden changes in vision and hearing, slight tinnitus, occasional headaches and dizziness. Have you noticed any pain associated with any of these symptoms?
PATIENT: Pain, Doctor? No. Absolutely not. It's not painful. It's… inconvenient. Exceedingly inconvenient. A blurring, a muffling… a decline in faculties. It’s hardly a matter for a pain scale. I haven't the time for melodramatics. Can we please proceed? I'm beginning to suspect this is a fruitless exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain. Let's move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must we? Really, Doctor, I’m a remarkably healthy woman for my age. A touch of hypertension, controlled with medication, naturally. And… a hysterectomy, decades ago. Beyond that, nothing of significance. I haven't been prone to illnesses. I simply haven't the constitution for it. I assure you, I'm not riddled with ailments. Do you require a list of everything I haven't had?
DOCTOR: Okay. Hypertension, controlled with medication, and a hysterectomy. Do you recall what year you had the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, the year? That was… a very long time ago. Perhaps the early nineties? Or late eighties? I honestly can’t recall the precise details. It was a… necessary procedure. My personal life is hardly relevant to my current affliction, is it? I assure you, it happened. It was… unpleasant. But the date eludes me. I have far more pressing matters to occupy my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, sometime in the late eighties or early nineties. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your hypertension?
PATIENT: Let me think… No. Just the usual for the blood pressure. A small dose, as prescribed. No vitamins, no supplements, no… homeopathic remedies. I rely on legitimate medical treatment, Doctor, not fads and folklore. I assure you, I'm a remarkably straightforward patient. I take my medication, I get a yearly check-up, and I maintain a busy practice. That is the extent of my medical involvement.
DOCTOR: Okay, just medication for hypertension. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Absolutely none. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m quite robust, as I’ve said. No sensitivities, no rashes, no… anaphylactic shock. Really, Doctor, I’m a remarkably uncomplicated case. Can we please move on to the solution? I have a hospital to run, and I'm wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with hearing or vision problems?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, dear. That’s… a rather extensive topic. My mother had cataracts, I believe, late in life. And my… uncle, on my father’s side, was rather hard of hearing. Beyond that… honestly, I have a large family, many of whom I haven’t seen in years. Details are… hazy. I can’t recall whether they were prone to ailments. It’s hardly relevant to my current predicament, is it? I’m experiencing a sudden onset of symptoms, not a generational curse.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had cataracts and your uncle was hard of hearing. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, are you questioning my character now? Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on occasion. And recreational drugs? The very notion is… appalling. I have a professional reputation to maintain, you know. I lead a remarkably disciplined life. A few early morning coffees, perhaps. But nothing… untoward. Really, Doctor, I find these questions rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very occasional alcohol, no recreational drugs. And you mentioned coffee. How many cups a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor! Are you cataloging my caffeine intake now? It's… a few. Two, perhaps three. It helps me maintain focus, you understand. Running a hospital is rather taxing. It's hardly a vice. I assure you, it's not the root cause of my current predicament. Can we please proceed to the examination? I’m beginning to suspect this entire exercise is… futile. I have a surgical schedule to consider.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. I understand your frustration. Let's do a quick examination. I'd like to check your ears, your eyes, and do a basic neurological assessment. It will just take a few minutes. If you could please sit up there, and we'll get started.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be quick. I haven’t got all day. And do be gentle, if you please. I haven’t the patience for discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to take a look inside your ears now. It might be slightly uncomfortable. Okay, your ear canals look clear. There's some cerumen buildup, but nothing significant. I’m not seeing any signs of infection or inflammation. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes. Just look straight ahead. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. The retinas look… somewhat pale, but not dramatically so. There’s a slight clouding of the lenses, which is consistent with age. But I don't see any acute abnormalities. Now, just follow my finger with your eyes. And can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year? Honestly, Doctor, must we? It’s… two thousand… twenty-five, I believe. Although, frankly, they all blur together these days. And please, do hurry. This is… unsettling. My vision feels even worse after that bright light.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're oriented to time. And your reflexes are normal. Your gait seems stable, although slightly hesitant. Based on this brief examination, there's no obvious, acute cause for your vision and hearing loss. The slight clouding of the lenses and pale retinas could be contributing to your visual changes, but it doesn’t explain the sudden onset. And the hearing…it's difficult to assess without more specialized equipment. Given your symptoms and the speed of their onset, I'd like to order a few tests. An audiometry test to assess your hearing, and a visual field test to check your peripheral vision. I’m also going to order a blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And finally, I think it would be prudent to get an MRI of your brain to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Good heavens. Must we go to such extremes? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds… rather drastic. Blood tests, I suppose, are unavoidable. But an MRI… I haven’t got time for lengthy procedures. And the cost… Very well. If you insist. But I expect a swift turnaround. I haven't the patience for prolonged investigations. And I trust you'll explain the results in a clear, concise manner. I don’t have time for medical jargon. I have patients waiting, you know. And frankly, I find this entire experience… deeply unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Julie. We’ll schedule the tests as quickly as possible. The blood test can be done today. And we can get the audiometry and visual field tests scheduled for tomorrow morning. The MRI will take a bit longer to schedule, but we'll expedite it as much as possible. I’ll have my assistant print out the lab orders and scheduling information for you. The audiometry and visual field tests are at the clinic across the street. And the MRI will be at St. Jude’s Hospital. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities and getting plenty of rest. If your symptoms worsen significantly – severe headache, dizziness, confusion, or any sudden changes in your vision – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Just… expedite these tests. And please, ensure the results are relayed to me promptly. I haven’t the patience for delays. And if there’s anything… anything at all… concerning, I expect a personal phone call. Not a voicemail. A personal phone call. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have patients waiting. I trust you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Ms. Julie. I'll make sure my assistant prioritizes your case. And I will personally call you with any concerning results. Get well soon, Ms. Julie. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. .
