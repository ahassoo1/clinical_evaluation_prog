DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation, and honestly, I’m just… curious. I work long hours, sometimes very stressful hours, with the railway, and I thought maybe it could help me relax a little. I’m not sure where to even begin, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's excellent that you're proactively looking for ways to manage stress, Ms. Sugino. Mindfulness and meditation can be very helpful tools, and it's common to feel unsure where to start. While I can certainly discuss the benefits and point you towards resources, my role as your physician is primarily to address any underlying medical concerns that may be contributing to your stress, or that stress may be exacerbating. So, to get a better understanding of your overall health, and to rule out any other potential causes for feeling overwhelmed, could we start by discussing your medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. I wouldn’t want to jump straight into… well, I don’t even know what I’d be jumping into! Medical history is a good place to start. I have Medicare, if that’s important. I… I don’t have a whole lot of problems, thankfully. I had pneumonia once, maybe ten years ago, and I get the occasional bad back from bending over the tracks, but that’s about it. Nothing serious, ever. Do you want dates or anything? I remember things pretty clearly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Sugino. Knowing you generally have good health is very helpful. And yes, if you wouldn’t mind providing approximate dates for those events, that would be great for a more complete record. Just anything you recall is fine. Regarding the pneumonia, do you remember if you were hospitalized, and if so, for how long?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It was… let me think… February of 2016, I believe. It was a particularly nasty winter. I was hospitalized. Three days, two nights. They said it was a fairly severe case, but I bounced back pretty quickly. I remember being very tired for a couple of weeks afterwards, but that was the worst of it. And the back… it flares up maybe once or twice a year. It’s just muscle strain, really. I usually just take some over-the-counter pain relievers and rest, and it goes away in a few days. Nothing that keeps me from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, February 2016 for the pneumonia, hospitalized for two nights. And intermittent back pain, resolving with over-the-counter medication and rest. Thank you. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. Never needed them, thankfully! I’ve been very lucky in that regard. Just the usual childhood things – tonsils out when I was little, but that was… oh, goodness, when I was seven, I think. But nothing since. My mother always said I had a strong constitution, and I suppose she was right.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure later in life, and my father… he had heart trouble. He was a smoker, unfortunately. Passed away when I was quite young, actually. My sister is healthy as a horse, as far as I know. No cancers, no major illnesses that I'm aware of. It’s a pretty healthy family, all things considered. Though, my grandmother on my mother’s side… she had arthritis, pretty bad, towards the end. But that was… a long time ago. Is that the kind of thing you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly the kind of information I’m looking for. High blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father , and arthritis in your grandmother. That’s very helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… Well, I live alone. I've never married. Not for lack of trying, but it just never… clicked, I suppose. I have a few close friends, mostly from work, that I see on weekends. We usually go for coffee or go to the cinema. I don’t smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week, but nothing excessive. I try to eat healthy, though it can be difficult with my schedule. And I work… a lot. Signal and Track Switch Repairers, as you know. It keeps me busy. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, that gives me a good overview, Ms. Sugino. You live alone, active social life with friends, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and a busy work schedule as a Signal and Track Switch Repairer. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and I’ve taken various medications when I’ve been sick, and never had a reaction. I’m pretty lucky that way, too. Honestly, I’m a fairly boring medical case.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Sugino. While a simple medical history is always best, it's still important to be thorough. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a quick check of your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and a general assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. I have no problem with that at all. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a while, actually. So, it’s probably a good idea. Lead the way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90 today, which is a little elevated. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m also going to listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Now, could you please lie back for me so I can listen to your heart?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. 140/90… is that something to be worried about? I don’t usually bother with doctors unless something is really wrong, so I’m a bit out of my depth with all of this. I've been a little stressed lately, as I said. Perhaps that’s it? I’m happy to lie here as long as you need. Do you need me to cross my arms or anything?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. You're right to ask about the blood pressure, Ms. Sugino. 140/90 is slightly elevated and warrants further attention. It could be related to stress, and we'll certainly explore that possibility. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. A single elevated reading isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, but we should monitor it and investigate further. Do you have any family history of hypertension, besides your mother?
PATIENT: That makes sense. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Hmm… let me think. My grandfather on my father’s side… he had high blood pressure, I believe. He lived a very… robust life, though, and didn't seem particularly bothered by it. He was a farmer, very active, but he did enjoy his salt, I remember that. My mother's side… not that I recall, no. Just my grandmother with the arthritis. Does enjoying salt matter? I do tend to put a bit extra on my food, I confess. It makes everything taste better.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about your grandfather's history, Ms. Sugino, and yes, a high salt intake can contribute to elevated blood pressure. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, your family history, and your reported stress levels, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel , and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. If it will give us a clearer picture, then I’m happy to do it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just tell me what I need to do. Do I need to fast beforehand? Or can I eat normally? I usually have a coffee with breakfast, I hope that won’t interfere.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Sugino. Yes, for the lipid panel, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. So, no food or drinks – including coffee – after midnight tonight. Water is fine. The other tests don't require fasting. I'll have the lab technician draw the blood first thing in the morning. It will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend some stress-reduction techniques. Have you ever considered mindfulness exercises, meditation, or yoga?
PATIENT: That’s good to know. No coffee… that might be the hardest part! But I can manage. Eight hours… I can definitely do that. And yes, that’s actually why I came in today! I have been hearing about mindfulness and meditation. It sounded… peaceful, I suppose. A little silly, if I’m honest, but I’m willing to try anything to feel a little less… frazzled. Do you have any recommendations? Or perhaps a class you’d suggest? I'm not very tech-savvy, though. I don’t really do apps or anything like that.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel skeptical, Ms. Sugino. It can seem a bit unconventional. But there's a lot of scientific evidence supporting the benefits of mindfulness and meditation for stress reduction. Since you’re not very tech-savvy, apps might not be the best option. There are several excellent books on mindfulness, and I can recommend a few. Alternatively, there are often introductory mindfulness classes offered at community centers or yoga studios. I have a pamphlet here with a list of local resources. In the meantime, even simple deep breathing exercises can be helpful. Try taking slow, deep breaths – inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth. You can do this anywhere, anytime. For now, let’s focus on getting those blood tests done and reviewing the results. Then we can discuss a more tailored plan for managing your stress and blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you for the pamphlet, I’ll definitely take a look. Deep breathing… I can certainly try that. It doesn’t seem too difficult. Hmm… let me see. No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring, which I appreciate. I feel much better having talked to you. So, first thing in the morning for the blood tests, then we’ll see what the results say. Is there anything I need to bring with me besides my Medicare card?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just your Medicare card will be fine, Ms. Sugino. The lab technician will take care of everything else. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. I’ll see you then. And remember, even small steps can make a big difference. Have a restful evening.
PATIENT: .
