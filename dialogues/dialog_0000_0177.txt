DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Jimmi, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Jimmi. Though, everyone just calls me Jimmi. What do you need to know? I ain't got all day.
DOCTOR: Well, Jimmi, I need to know why you’ve come to see me today. It's my job to find out what’s bothering you. Don’t tell me what you need, tell me what brought you in here. Now, start from the beginning. What's been going on?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well... it's kinda embarrassing, you know? A fella... a nice young fella... and now... somethin's leakin'. Down there. It's... not normal, is it? It ain't like water, if you know what I mean. And it smells funny.
DOCTOR: “Leakin’,” you say. And it’s not normal, and has an odor. Right. Well, Jimmi, many things can cause discharge. It's good you’re addressing it. Before we go any further, can you describe the… discharge?
PATIENT: Describe it? Like... color? It’s… yellowish, I think. Kinda thick, kinda not. And there’s… bits in it sometimes. Like little… flakes. Ugh, I don’t wanna talk about the bits. It just started a couple days ago, after... well, you know. With the fella.
DOCTOR: Right. Yellowish, varying consistency, and… flakes. Started a couple of days ago following sexual activity. Is there any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s a little… sore, maybe, when I gotta go. And it's itchy sometimes, yeah. Mostly just bothersome, not like a real itch, you know? Just… uncomfortable. Makes me not wanna… well, you get it.
DOCTOR: Soreness with urination, intermittent itching… alright. Have you experienced any fever, lower abdominal pain, or unusual odor lately?
PATIENT: Fever? No. No fever. And my tummy feels alright, thank you very much. Like I said, just a little uncomfortable down there. This smell, though... that's new. It ain’t a good smell, lemme tell ya. Not like a woman should smell.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no abdominal pain, just the unusual discharge and odor. Now, Jimmi, have you had any previous sexually transmitted infections, or have you ever been tested for them?
PATIENT: Tested? Oh, goodness, no. Not me. Back in my day, we didn’t worry about all that. You just… didn’t. And I certainly haven't had any... infections that I know of. I mean, I've had a little trouble here and there, but nothin' a little somethin’ couldn’t fix.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no prior testing, no known infections. Okay. And have you been sexually active with other partners recently?
PATIENT: Well… that young fella is the first in… a long time. A very long time. Haven't been with anyone else, no. Just him. He seemed nice enough. Said he was a fisherman, you know. Strong hands…
DOCTOR: Right, alright. It’s good you've only had one partner recently. Let's get down to business, Jimmi. I’m going to need to perform a quick pelvic exam. It's necessary to determine the cause of this discharge. It will be… uncomfortable, but quick. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A what now? A pelvic…exam? You want me to… what? Oh, goodness no! I didn’t come here for that! I just want somethin’ for the leakin’. Can’t you just give me a pill or somethin’? I ain't gettin' poked and prodded by nobody.
DOCTOR: Jimmi, I am a doctor. I need to examine you to make a proper diagnosis. “A pill” isn’t going to fix this, and prescribing medication without knowing the cause is irresponsible, and frankly, dangerous. It’s very likely this is a simple infection, but I need to confirm. Refusing the exam doesn’t make the problem go away. Now, are you willing to let me perform a quick exam, or would you prefer I refer you to another physician?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Fine. But it better be quick, and gentle. And no judgin'. I've lived a long life, seen a lot. I don’t need a lecture. Just… fix the leakin’. And don’t go touchin’ nothin’ I don't need you to touch.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please disrobe from the waist down and lie on the table. I will explain everything as I go. I’ll be right back with the necessary instruments. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Honestly. Some people…
DOCTOR: Alright, Jimmi. I'm going to visually inspect the area first. Then, I will need to take a small sample of the discharge. It might feel a little…uncomfortable, but it will be quick. I’m also going to palpate your abdomen to rule out any other issues. Let me know if you feel any pain. I'm observing some redness and mild swelling. Now, I need to collect a sample. This will involve a swab. Take a deep breath…
PATIENT: Oh! That's cold! And… ugh. No, no, no. Stop that ticklin'! It feels… intrusive. And honestly, are you sure you need a whole swab? Couldn't you just get a little bit? This is awful. Hurry up, please. Just get it over with!
DOCTOR: Alright, I have enough of a sample now. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. This will help me rule out any internal issues that might be causing your symptoms. No tenderness or masses detected. Alright, that’s all I need for now. Please get dressed. I’ll send the sample to the lab for analysis, and we should have results in a few days.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That was… unpleasant. You’re awfully rough, you know? A little warnin' would be nice. A few days, you say? What if it gets worse in a few days? And what exactly am I supposed to do until then? Just… leak? This is just ridiculous.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend practicing good hygiene – wash the area gently with mild soap and water. Avoid douching or using any scented products. As for “just leakin’,” as you put it, there's not much we can do until we know what we’re dealing with. Based on your symptoms, it's likely a bacterial vaginosis or a sexually transmitted infection, but we need the lab results to confirm. I’m going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a precaution, in case it is bacterial vaginosis. But if it turns out to be an STI, this antibiotic won’t help. Here’s the prescription. Take as directed. If your symptoms worsen – increased pain, fever, unusual odor – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A broad-spectrum antibiotic. What kind is it? And what if it makes me sick? Everything always makes me sick. And... what if that fella gave me somethin' terrible? You said STI... that sounds awful. Should I tell him? He seemed like a nice young man, but... Oh, goodness. This is just a mess. I just wanted somethin' for the leakin', not a whole ordeal.
DOCTOR: It’s amoxicillin-clavulanate. As for side effects, nausea and diarrhea are possible, but usually mild. If you experience a severe allergic reaction – difficulty breathing, swelling – seek immediate medical attention. Regarding your… partner, it is advisable to inform him. If you do have an STI, he needs to be tested and treated as well. It’s a matter of public health, and frankly, responsible behavior. We will know more once the lab results come back. In the meantime, follow the instructions, practice good hygiene, and contact me if you have any concerns. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Responsible behavior... now you're tellin' me. Honestly. A young man… probably doesn't even have a regular doctor. And what if he gets mad? No. No more questions. Just... get me out of here. I'm too old for this. Too old for all of it. Just… thank you, I guess. And try not to be so rough with the next patient.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is my card should you require anything further. Stop.
