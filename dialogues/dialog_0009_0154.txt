DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. It's nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Petrimoulx, was it? Yes. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks. They bother me. A lot. Keeps coming back, this trouble. I don’t… I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it's been… a while. I just want it fixed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, I understand. “Trouble with your waterworks” – that’s a good way to put it. And you've been dealing with this for some time. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what's been going on. When you say “trouble”, can you describe specifically what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specifics… that’s… difficult. It burns, mostly. When I… go to the bathroom. And I feel like I have to go all the time, even when I just have gone. It’s uncomfortable. And sometimes… sometimes it smells bad, if you must know. Is that… alright to say? I apologize if that’s… rude.
DOCTOR: No, it’s absolutely alright to say, Ms. Wease. It’s important for me to understand everything that’s going on, and that’s very helpful information. Burning with urination and the frequent urge to go, even after just emptying your bladder… and noticing a foul odor. Is the burning constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. It’s not… always there. But when it is there… it’s quite unpleasant. More often at night, I think. Wakes me up sometimes. And it feels… worse when I don’t drink enough water. Or maybe that’s just me remembering things wrong… I’m not very good at keeping track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, worse at night, and seems to be related to your fluid intake. That’s helpful. You mentioned it feels worse when you don’t drink enough water. Do you have any difficulty with drinking fluids – do you feel thirsty often, or have trouble getting enough to drink during the day?
PATIENT: No, no trouble drinking. I drink… tea, mostly. And sometimes juice. I should drink more water, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me that. But… it doesn’t taste of much, does it? And tea is… comforting. I don't feel thirsty, not usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you drink tea and juice, and don’t typically feel thirsty. Now, aside from the burning and frequent urination, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes… a little ache, low down. In my tummy. Not a bad ache, just… there. And sometimes I feel a bit tired. But I'm sixty-six! I am supposed to be tired, aren't I? I don't know what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Ms. Wease! It can be hard to know what's normal at any age. A little ache low down in your abdomen and some fatigue… okay. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… I had a bad gallbladder, years ago. They took it out. And… arthritis, I suppose. In my hands. Nothing… serious. I don’t recall anything else, to be honest. My doctor… she retired, you see. A long time ago. I haven’t… kept up with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and arthritis. Thank you. And you haven’t seen a doctor regularly since your previous doctor retired. Do you know if you’ve ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Just the gallbladder. And… a hysterectomy, when I was younger. That was… a long time ago. Before my daughter was born. Everything else… I really can’t recall. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. Thank you, Ms. Wease. It's perfectly alright that you don't recall everything. We’ll take things slowly. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I haven’t… reacted badly to any medicine, as far as I know. I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes, but nothing regular. Just when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you take medication for your arthritis as needed. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin, I think. My daughter buys them for me. Says I need it. I don’t… pay much attention to it. And… sometimes I take something for my waterworks. When it’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and something for your waterworks when needed. Do you happen to know the name of that medication you take for your waterworks?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don’t. It’s… a little blue pill, I think. Or maybe white? My daughter gets it for me. She knows all these things. I just… take it when I need to. I haven’t even looked at the bottle. I am terribly sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Wease, don’t worry about it. We can try to figure it out later. It’s good you're letting me know you're taking something for the symptoms. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if that’s okay. Have any close family members – parents, siblings, children – had any health problems, like kidney disease, diabetes, or bladder problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had problems with his stomach. But nothing… specific. Nobody ever talked much about health, if you must know. It wasn't… polite, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had high blood pressure and your brother had stomach problems. Thank you. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't like the smell of it. My husband… he smoked, for a long time. But I always made him go outside. It's a terrible habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've never smoked. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine, sometimes. With dinner. Not every night, mind you. Just… a small glass. For my health, my daughter says! It’s supposed to be good for your heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine occasionally. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. It'll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, please. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I will be very gentle. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Not significant, but worth noting. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a urine test. It’ll help us check for infection or any other abnormalities. Do you have any issues providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine test… sensible, I suppose. No, I don’t think I’ll have trouble with that. It’s… a bit awkward, but I manage. Where… where do I go to do it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. There’s a restroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a sterile cup, and I’ll leave instructions for you. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means starting to urinate and then collecting the sample a few seconds later. I'll also have the nurse check your blood pressure. After you’ve provided the sample, just let me know and I’ll be right back to discuss the results and next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the restroom?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… how long will it be before we know something? I don't want to be waiting around all day.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Wease. The lab usually takes about 30-60 minutes to process a urine sample. So, hopefully, we’ll have the results within an hour. I'll check in with you then. In the meantime, try to relax and drink some water if you're thirsty. Let me know when you've completed the sample, and I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I shall… try to relax. And I will let you know.
DOCTOR: .
