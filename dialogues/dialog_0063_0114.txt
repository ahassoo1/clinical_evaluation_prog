DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my breathing. It gets…difficult when I try to lie flat. Like when I’m trying to sleep, or rest. It feels like…something is pressing on my chest, I suppose. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Difficult” is rather vague, Ms. Vanderwiele. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… Well, it’s not a cough, and it’s not like I’m wheezing. It's…shortness of breath, I suppose. Like I can’t get a full breath when I’m lying down. Sitting up is fine. Always has been. It’s just…when I recline. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month. I’m not very good at keeping track of dates, you know.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And has this shortness of breath been getting progressively worse, or has it remained relatively stable?
PATIENT: It’s…worse now than it was. Definitely. At first, I just adjusted my pillows. More pillows, you see. But now, even with a lot of pillows, it’s still…uncomfortable. It wakes me up sometimes, to be honest. I used to sleep like a log, you know. Now, not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any other symptoms along with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No coughing, as I said. No pain, exactly. Just…a feeling of being…full, perhaps? In my chest. And sometimes, my ankles swell a little at the end of the day, but I always figured that was just from being on my feet too long. I do a lot of filing at the library, you know. It’s a physical job.
DOCTOR: Filing at the library. Right. And have you noticed any palpitations, or a racing heart?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Racing heart? I don’t know what those are, Doctor. My heart feels…normal, I think. It beats. I haven’t felt it fluttering or anything like that. Just…tired, sometimes. But I am seventy-one, you know. A little tiredness is to be expected.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions…let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in…oh, goodness, the eighties, I suppose. And arthritis, of course. Just the usual aches and pains. Nothing serious. And high blood pressure, the doctor told me once. But I take my medicine for that. Every day. A little white pill. I can’t recall the name, though. I have a lot of pills, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what other medications are you currently taking, besides this “little white pill” for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, there's something for my arthritis. A pink one, I believe. And…oh, yes, a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. I do spend most of my day indoors, you know. And sometimes, when my aches are particularly bad, I take something over-the-counter. Ibuprofen, I think it is. But not every day. Only when needed. I try not to take too many pills, you know.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, frequently?
PATIENT: Frequently? No, no, not frequently. Just…when my arthritis flares up. Maybe once or twice a week, at most. And not for very long. A day or two, perhaps. I really don’t like taking pills, you know. They make me feel…sluggish. And I try to stay active. I do a lot of walking, when the weather is nice. I walk to the library, you know. It’s a good walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, you know. I’m not a picky eater. And I’ve never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy. No, no allergies, Doctor. I’m a very…robust person, you know. Usually. That’s why this breathing trouble is so concerning.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s do a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your lungs and heart. And I will need to check your ankles for swelling, as you mentioned.
PATIENT: Oh. All right. It’s…a little high, isn't it? But I suppose I can manage. Just let me know if I’m being difficult. I don't move as quickly as I used to, you know.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Again… and again. Your heart sounds… slightly muffled. Mild pitting edema present in both ankles. Now, let me listen to your back. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but breathing sounds diminished at the bases.
PATIENT: Diminished… What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? I just want to get back to work, you know. The library is very busy this time of year. And I have a lot of filing to do. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It suggests fluid accumulation, Ms. Vanderwiele. Now, please remain still. I need to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is elevated. And your pulse is…irregular. We need to run some tests, Ms. Vanderwiele. An EKG, a chest X-ray, and a blood panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. And I'm going to order a BNP test.
PATIENT: Tests… Tests? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is it my heart? I thought I was just a little out of shape. Is it something I did? I try to take care of myself, you know. I really don't like tests. What are you looking for? And how long will it take? I have a schedule, you know. A very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: The tests will help determine the cause of your shortness of breath, Ms. Vanderwiele. It could be heart-related, or it could be something else entirely. We need to rule out several possibilities. The blood work and X-ray can be done right here, and the EKG will only take a few minutes. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray and EKG immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Standard procedure… Will it hurt? The tests, I mean. And will I be able to go back to work afterward? I really need to get back to work, Doctor. They’re counting on me. And…what if it is my heart? What happens then? I just want to know what’s going on. And I want to get back to my life.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a slight pinch, Ms. Vanderwiele. The EKG is painless; it involves placing electrodes on your chest. As for your heart, we will discuss that after the tests. We need information first. I'm going to order a D-dimer as well. The nurse will be in shortly to begin the blood work. I will review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please try to rest. And avoid strenuous activity. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: .
