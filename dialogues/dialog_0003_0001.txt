DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's try to be brief, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, brief is good. I’ve… well, I’ve been smoking for a very long time, and I think it’s finally time to see about stopping. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, at my age, still clinging to that habit.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s never too late to address these things. Though frankly, I find it quite… imprudent to continue such behaviors for so long. Let’s get some details. How many years, approximately, have you been smoking?
PATIENT: Approximately? Oh, let me think… It began… just after the war, you see. 1950, maybe '51. So… seventy-three, seventy-four years, give or take a few months. A very long time, indeed. Mostly unfiltered cigarettes, back then, you understand.
DOCTOR: Seventy-four years… remarkable. And how many cigarettes per day, on average, would you say?
PATIENT: On average… that’s a good question. It varied, naturally. When I was working, maybe two packs. A full pack before breakfast, you understand. But in retirement… a pack, perhaps a little more, if I’m being honest. A carton lasts me about a week, give or take. Does that help you determine an average?
DOCTOR: A carton a week… that equates to roughly 20 cigarettes a day. I see. And have you attempted to quit previously?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Several times. Patches, mostly. And those… gum things. Nicorette, I believe they were called. They made me quite nauseous, to be frank. And my neighbor, Mrs. Olsen, she swore by hypnosis. That didn’t work at all. Spent good money on that, I did. No, nothing has truly… taken. I always go back to them. It's… a comfort, you see. A terrible comfort, I know.
DOCTOR: Understandable, though a misguided one. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… My knees, they bother me something awful, especially in damp weather. Arthritis, the doctor said, years ago. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. But nothing… serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, truth be told. I try to avoid them when I can. I’m generally… resilient, you understand. But the smoking… that’s a different matter.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and declining vision… noted. And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or for anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never been one for pills, if I can help it. A bit of liniment for the knees, when they're particularly bad. And I take a multivitamin, occasionally. But that’s it. I prefer… natural remedies, when possible. Though I haven’t found a natural remedy for this particular habit, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I ate a great deal of shellfish in my youth, and never had a problem. Occasionally a bit of a rash from poison ivy, when I was a boy, but nothing serious. I've never been one to react badly to things, generally speaking. A strong constitution, you understand. Though, as I said, this habit… it’s proving rather resistant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and perhaps your hands. Just a standard assessment. If you could just sit up and lean forward, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Though I warn you, my heart has seen a great deal of living. And my lungs… well, they’ve certainly had their share of smoke. I trust it won’t be too unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is somewhat elevated, and I detect a slight murmur… not immediately concerning, but something to monitor. Lungs exhibit diminished breath sounds bilaterally, with some wheezing present. Throat appears mildly inflamed, likely from years of smoke irritation. Skin appears slightly greyish, and I do note some mild clubbing of the fingertips… a common finding in chronic smokers. Alright. Thank you, Mr. Knoch. That will be sufficient for now.
PATIENT: Well. That doesn’t sound particularly encouraging, does it? I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. Diminished breath sounds… clubbing of the fingertips… I've been aware, for some time, that I wasn’t in the best of health. What… what does this mean, Doctor? What are my options, if any? And, if I may be blunt, what am I looking at?
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, your history and physical findings are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, a common consequence of long-term smoking. The clubbing indicates chronic hypoxia – a lack of oxygen. The diminished breath sounds are indicative of airway obstruction. The best option, unequivocally, is to quit smoking. Immediately. Beyond that, we can manage your symptoms with bronchodilators – inhalers – to open your airways. I can prescribe you one now, if you wish. However, understand that this is a palliative measure only. COPD is progressive, and there is no cure. Your prognosis, frankly, is dependent on your ability to cease smoking. Continuing will lead to further deterioration. I can provide you with some information on smoking cessation programs, but ultimately, it requires willpower.
PATIENT: COPD… progressive… no cure… Willpower… yes. That’s what everyone says. And I’ve tried. Many times. But seventy-four years… it’s a deeply ingrained habit, Doctor. An inhaler… to make it easier to breathe while I… continue to destroy my lungs? It feels… rather pointless, doesn’t it? But… what kind of inhaler are we talking about? And what are these… cessation programs? Perhaps… perhaps a bit of help is worth a try. Though I confess, I'm not particularly optimistic. But, tell me about the programs, Doctor. And about the inhaler. What are the side effects? I like to know these things.
DOCTOR: Here. This pamphlet details several smoking cessation programs available in the area. There are support groups, nicotine replacement therapy options, and even some pharmacological interventions. As for the inhaler, I’m prescribing you a short-acting beta-agonist – albuterol. It’s a bronchodilator, as I mentioned. It will help to open your airways and make breathing easier. Common side effects include tremors, increased heart rate, and nervousness. These are usually mild and transient. However, if you experience chest pain or difficulty breathing after using the inhaler, seek immediate medical attention. I will also provide a prescription for a rescue inhaler to use in emergencies. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Support groups… I don’t think so. Too much… socializing. Tremors, increased heart rate… Well, I suppose I’m already familiar with those. From the cigarettes, you understand. So, this albuterol… how often do I use it? And what does it feel like? Will I… feel a difference immediately? I'm not quite sure I understand. And what exactly is a "rescue inhaler"? It sounds rather… alarming. I feel as though I’m being bombarded with information, Doctor. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms? I’m an old man, you see. It’s difficult to absorb so much at once.
DOCTOR: Very well. The albuterol inhaler is used as needed – when you’re experiencing shortness of breath or wheezing. You’ll take two puffs, holding your breath for ten seconds after each puff. It should provide relief within a few minutes. You’ll feel… a loosening in your chest, an easing of your breathing. It’s not a cure, mind you, simply a temporary respite. The “rescue inhaler” – also albuterol, but in a higher dosage – is for acute exacerbations – sudden worsening of your breathing. If your symptoms aren’t responding to your regular inhaler, or if you’re experiencing severe chest tightness, that’s when you use it. It’s a safety measure, nothing to be alarmed about, if used properly. Are we clear now?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. As needed… two puffs… holding my breath… rescue inhaler for emergencies… It sounds… complicated. And rather frightening, to be honest. I understand you’re trying to help me, Doctor. I truly do. But this COPD… it sounds like a rather bleak prognosis, regardless. Is there… anything else I should be aware of? Any lifestyle changes, besides quitting smoking, that might… mitigate the damage? I’m not expecting miracles, you understand. Just… anything at all that might… help me breathe a little easier. I suppose that’s all I can hope for, at this point.
DOCTOR: Beyond smoking cessation, there’s little you can do to reverse the damage. Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce your workload, and avoiding exposure to irritants – dust, fumes, pollution – is advisable. Pulmonary rehabilitation – a program of exercise and education – may improve your quality of life, but it's not a cure. Honestly, Mr. Knoch, the single most important thing you can do is quit smoking. Everything else is merely palliative. I’m prescribing you the inhalers and providing the information, but your fate rests in your own hands. I have other patients waiting. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: …No. I believe… I believe that’s all. You’ve… been very thorough, Doctor. And very… blunt. Perhaps blunt is what I needed. Thank you. I will… try to quit. I can’t promise success, but I will try. Thank you again, Doctor. .
