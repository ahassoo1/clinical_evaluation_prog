DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it's my back, mostly. It’s been…painful, yeah. Not sharp, exactly, more of a dull ache that just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Right. A dull ache. And how long has this "dull ache" been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…let me think. It started…maybe a month ago? At least a month. It comes and goes, but lately it's been pretty constant, if that makes sense. It’s worse when I bend over, you know, like trying to pick something up.
DOCTOR: A month. Worse with bending. Okay. And can you tell me exactly where on your back the pain is located?
PATIENT: Hmm…it’s lower back, definitely. Right around here. It’s not radiating down my legs or anything, just…right there. Sometimes it feels like it goes a little to the side, but mostly just in that lower part.
DOCTOR: Lower back, localized. No radiation. Alright. Now, Mr. Way, have you done anything to try and alleviate the pain?
PATIENT: Well, my wife, she’s always telling me to stretch. I try to do a few of those things she shows me, but I'm not very good at remembering them, to be honest. And I’ve been taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen kind. They help a little, but not for very long.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. And how much ibuprofen are you taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, um…let me see. Usually two pills, two times a day. When it’s really bad, maybe I’ll take another one in the afternoon. But I don’t do that every day, just when I really need it. I’m not sure what the dosage is exactly…the bottle says something, but my eyes aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to be careful with how much ibuprofen you're taking, especially long-term. Let's get a better idea of what's going on. Have you had any injuries to your back recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Nothing I can think of, anyway. I haven’t fallen or anything like that. Just…old age, maybe? I do a little gardening, but nothing too heavy. Mostly just weeding and pruning. It just sort of…started hurting one day.
DOCTOR: Gardening. Alright. Now, Mr. Way, let's move on. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that every morning. And…hmm. I think that’s it. Nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure. And what medication are you taking for that, specifically?
PATIENT: Let me see…it’s a little white pill. I think the name is…Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril, that’s it. Small dose, the doctor said, just enough to keep things under control. I’ve been taking it for…oh, maybe five years now.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks, though, she’s very careful with those things. She’ll ask when they give me something at the dentist, just to be sure. But I haven’t had any allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Way, I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination of your back. Just so I can get a better feel for what’s going on. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s fine. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My back isn’t always very cooperative, you know.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your stomach, if you can. I'll gently palpate your back and check your range of motion. Let me know if anything causes pain. Now, if you could just……there we go. Okay. And can you tell me if this is tender, or does this feel particularly sore?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, right there. That's it. That's where it hurts the most. Not like a sharp pain, just…a deep ache. It’s definitely worse when you press on it. And it feels a little…stiff, you know? Like something is tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about when I ask you to bend forward?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s not so good. It’s tight, like something is pulling. I can’t go very far without it hurting. My wife always tells me I need to stretch more, but it’s hard when it hurts! It's better if I go slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you try twisting to the left, and then to the right?
PATIENT: Ooh, left is a little better than right. Right feels…locked up, almost. Like it wants to stop. It’s not a sharp pain, just…resistance. I don’t feel like I can twist very far without making it worse. I'm getting old, you know. Everything creaks!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Way, based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back. It’s not uncommon, especially with gardening and with age. However, without imaging, it’s difficult to rule out other possibilities. Given your age and lack of improvement with over-the-counter medication, I recommend we get an X-ray to rule out any underlying bone issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Hmm…well, I don’t like being exposed to all that radiation, but if you think it’s necessary, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then let’s do it. Just…hope it’s not anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s a standard precaution, Mr. Way. Now, since you’re uninsured, we’ll need to discuss the cost of the X-ray and potential follow-up care. The radiology department will be able to provide you with a price estimate. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief, but at a lower dosage than you were taking before - two ibuprofen pills, twice a day, only when needed. And I'm going to write you a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you some exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Lower dosage on the ibuprofen, and the physical therapist…that’s a good idea. My wife’s been telling me to go to one for years! I appreciate you writing me a referral. As for the cost…well, that’s always a worry, but we’ll figure something out. Just want to get this back feeling better, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll get the referral and a printed information sheet about the physical therapy program for you. I’m also going to write a brief summary of our consultation for your records. We’ll get the X-ray scheduled as soon as possible, and once we have the results, we can discuss a more definitive treatment plan. In the meantime, avoid any strenuous activity and try to maintain good posture. Any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your help. Just…hope it's nothing too serious. I’ll try to take it easy and follow your instructions. Thank you again, Doctor Pitmon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just try to follow the instructions. And remember to take it easy. The receptionist will schedule your X-ray on the way out. Have a good day, Mr. Way.
