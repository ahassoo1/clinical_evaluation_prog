DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were different. Honestly? I’ve just been feeling… down. Very down. It’s been going on for a little while now, and frankly, I’m tired of feeling this way. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Derasmo. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. “Feeling down” can mean a lot of different things, so let’s try to get a better understanding of what you’re experiencing. Could you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm. What does it feel like… It’s difficult to explain. It’s not like a physical pain, you understand. It’s more… a heaviness. A constant weight on my chest. I don't enjoy the things I used to. Used to love my garden, now… I just look at it. Everything feels… pointless, if I’m being honest. And I sleep terribly. Or rather, I don’t sleep enough. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Mrs. Derasmo. That “heaviness” and loss of enjoyment are important clues. And the sleep disturbance is significant as well. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me approximately how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It’s not been a sudden thing, you see. It… crept up on me, I think. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly. It started after… well, after the divorce was finalized. Though I don't know if that's why. It was a long time coming, that divorce. A relief, in some ways, but… now this.
DOCTOR: Six months is helpful to know. And it's certainly possible the divorce is a contributing factor, even if it felt like a relief at the time. Major life changes often trigger these kinds of feelings. To get a better sense of how this is impacting your daily life, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you experienced any difficulty with concentration or memory?
PATIENT: My appetite… yes, it’s been off. I used to enjoy cooking, big, elaborate meals for my friends. Now, I mostly just… pick at things. Toast, maybe. Fruit. Nothing with much flavour, really. And concentration? Oh, goodness. Terrible. I find myself rereading the same paragraph several times and still not knowing what it says. I used to be very sharp, you see. Very organized. Now… things just slip my mind. I forget appointments. Names. It’s quite embarrassing, actually.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Derasmo. Those changes in appetite and concentration are important to note. We’re gathering a lot of information that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had my hip replaced about five years ago. That was… a bit of a struggle, but I’ve recovered well, thankfully. Otherwise… nothing major. A bit of arthritis, here and there, but nothing that requires regular treatment. I used to be very active, as you might imagine, given my profession. Lifeguarding keeps you fit, you know! But I haven’t been… as mobile lately. Partly the hip, partly… this feeling.
DOCTOR: Thank you. The hip replacement and arthritis are good to know. And it sounds like this feeling is impacting your activity level. Have you ever been diagnosed with, or received treatment for, anxiety or depression in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not formally, at least. My mother always said I was “strong-willed,” and that I should just “pull myself together.” I suppose I’ve always tried to handle things on my own. But… this is different. I can’t just “pull myself together” this time. It’s… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mrs. Derasmo. It's very common for people to try to manage these things on their own, and it takes courage to come in and seek help. It sounds like you've been trying to be strong for a long time. Just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes. I take a multivitamin, that's all. And occasionally, ibuprofen for the arthritis, but not very often. Perhaps once or twice a month, if I've overdone it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can. My late husband was always in and out of doctors, and I swore I wouldn't end up the same way.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Multivitamins and occasional ibuprofen. Now, Mrs. Derasmo, would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs, and checked your reflexes?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. Though I doubt you'll find anything. I've always been perfectly healthy. It’s just… my mind, I think. It's all in my head. But I suppose you have to check.
DOCTOR: It’s always important to rule out any underlying medical causes, even if we suspect it’s related to mood. And you’re right, sometimes it is just our minds playing tricks on us. Okay, your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but nothing concerning. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range. I’m also noting your weight today is 78 kilograms. Now, Mrs. Derasmo, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with depression. It’s important to remember that depression isn't a sign of weakness; it’s a medical condition that can be effectively treated. We can pursue some blood work to rule out any other possible causes, and I can also discuss options for treatment with you, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Therapy… medication… Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds rather… daunting. I’ve never been one for talking about my feelings, and the thought of taking pills… Well, I’m not sure. But… I suppose I’m here because I want to feel better. I just don’t want to… change who I am.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about therapy and medication, and you’re right to want to feel like you’re still you. The goal isn't to change who you are, but to help you feel like yourself again – to regain the enjoyment and energy you've lost. Therapy can provide you with tools to manage your feelings, and medication can help to balance the chemicals in your brain that may be contributing to your symptoms. We can start slowly, and find what works best for you. Perhaps we could start with a referral to a therapist who specializes in grief and loss?
PATIENT: Grief and loss… That sounds… sensible, I suppose. It has been a difficult year, even if I don’t like to admit it. The divorce was… final, and then my sister passed away a few months ago. I haven't really allowed myself to feel anything about it, to be honest. Just kept busy. Perhaps talking to someone… might help. But please, no pills right away. Not unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: I agree, Mrs. Derasmo. Talking to someone sounds like a good first step, and I completely respect your preference to hold off on medication for now. We can certainly revisit that option later if therapy isn’t providing enough relief. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a therapist who specializes in grief counseling. She has excellent reviews, and I think you’d feel comfortable with her. I’ll also give you a list of local support groups in case you’re interested. Here’s her contact information and a little bit about her practice. Her office is located about twenty minutes from here. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you. I suppose I can call and schedule it myself. I’m rather… independent, you see. I don’t want to be a bother. Thank you, Doctor. I… appreciate your patience. I’m not used to talking about these things.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mrs. Derasmo. And you’ve taken a very brave first step, simply by coming in today. It takes courage to acknowledge what you’re going through, and I commend you for that. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. And remember, it’s okay to not be okay, and it’s okay to ask for help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that will be all. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. I suppose… I’ll be in touch if I need anything. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Derasmo. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out. Goodbye, and I wish you all the best.
