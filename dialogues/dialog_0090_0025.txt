DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I want to know… about my family. Long time ago, you know? I hear now, you can find out… with spit? About where people come from. I want to see if that’s true, for me.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. You’ve heard about genetic ancestry testing. It is becoming more common. You’re interested in learning more about your family history through a DNA sample, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. My family… we been on islands a long, long time. But before that? I don’t know. My mama, she tell stories, but… old stories. Not names, you understand? Just… where we fish, where we build houses. I want to know… real names. Is possible?
DOCTOR: Well, it can be possible to get some information. These tests analyze your DNA, and compare it to databases of other people’s DNA. It can sometimes give you an idea of your ethnic origins, and potentially connect you to distant relatives. But it's not a perfect science, Mr. Scobie. And it won’t necessarily give you “real names,” as you put it. It gives percentages, probabilities. It's more about broad ancestral groups than specific individuals. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Percentages… hmm. Like… eighty percent this island, twenty percent that island? Is like that? I not so good with… numbers, Doctor. But… even just knowing… something more than stories… that would be good. Is expensive? I only have Medicare.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a fair way to think about it – percentages representing potential origins. And you’re right to ask about cost. These tests are generally not covered by Medicare, unfortunately. They are considered elective, not medically necessary. The price varies quite a bit – from a couple hundred dollars to several hundred, depending on the company and the depth of the analysis. Let me see if I can find some reputable companies and their approximate costs for you. But honestly, Mr. Scobie, I would advise against spending a lot of money on something that may not provide the answers you're hoping for. It’s easy to get carried away with these things.
PATIENT: Hmm… easy to get carried away… that’s true. I’ve heard stories. People find cousins they never know, then argue about money. I don’t want trouble. Just… where my people come from, that’s all. Maybe just the cheapest one, then? If it’s not too much… if Medicare don’t pay, I have little money saved. But even a little knowing… is better than nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, the least expensive options are often the least comprehensive, and sometimes the least reliable. They may only give you very broad regional information, rather than specifics. And there’s always the question of privacy – these companies store your DNA data. It's something to consider. Okay, here's one company… 23andMe. They offer ancestry testing for around $99. But again, that’s just a starting point. It won’t give you a detailed family tree, or definitive answers. And I must reiterate, I don’t actively recommend these tests, as they aren’t part of standard medical practice. But if you’re determined, and understand the limitations, it’s your decision. Do you have any other health concerns today that we should address?
PATIENT: Twenty-three… hmm. Sounds like a number. I not so good with computers, Doctor. Can you do it for me? Like, I give you spit, you send it away, you tell me what they say? I trust you. Not so much the number companies. Is that possible? Would that be… too much trouble?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, I am a physician, not a genealogy service. I do not have the time, nor the resources, to facilitate these tests for my patients. My practice focuses on your medical wellbeing, not tracing ancestry. It would be a misuse of my expertise, and frankly, it’s not something I offer. I can, however, provide you with information on reputable genetic counseling services in the area, if you’re interested. They can discuss the pros and cons of these tests with you in more detail, and help you understand the results. But I cannot personally handle the testing process for you. Perhaps we should focus on your current health concerns?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. I didn’t mean to… trouble you. I just thought… you know medicine, you know things. My mama, she always take things to the wise woman in the village. I thought you was the wise woman here. I sorry, Doctor. No trouble. I just… want to know. Maybe I just forget it. But... is there anything you can tell me? About people on the islands… long time ago? About their health, maybe? What kind of sickness they have? Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, it’s alright. I understand your perspective. And you’re right, historically, people did turn to those with knowledge in the community for guidance. While I can’t trace your family’s specific origins, I can speak to the general health challenges faced by people in the Marshall Islands historically. There’s been a long history of dietary deficiencies, particularly related to access to fresh fruits and vegetables. There were also issues with infectious diseases, like tuberculosis, introduced with outside contact. And, unfortunately, there’s a higher incidence of certain cancers in the Marshall Islands, linked to past nuclear testing. Is that the kind of information you were hoping for?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s good. That’s… something. My mama, she tell stories about the sickness. The coughing one, and the one that make you weak. She say the old people know how to make medicines from the plants. But now… not so many people know. The testing… the spit… forget it. That’s too much trouble. But… you can tell me more about the sickness? What kind of plants they use? If you know. Maybe I can learn. For my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Scobie. While my expertise isn’t in traditional medicine, I can share some general information. Historically, many Pacific Islanders used plants like noni, turmeric, and ginger for their medicinal properties. Noni was often used for pain relief and boosting the immune system. Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties. And ginger was used for nausea and digestive issues. However, it's important to be cautious about using herbal remedies. The potency and safety of these plants can vary, and they can interact with other medications. I can provide you with some reputable resources on Pacific Islander health and traditional medicine, but I strongly advise against self-treating any medical condition. Now, let's return to your current health. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms that brought you in today, other than a desire to learn about your family history?
