DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, doc. It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Gets worse when I try to…well, when I try to do things. Not that I do much these days, mind you. But it’s annoying. Just want it fixed, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It’s frustrating when something interferes with your daily activities. We’ll certainly try to figure out what’s going on and how to best manage it. When you say “for a bit now,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been noticing this shaking?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Honestly? I dunno. Months, maybe? Time kinda…blurs together, you know? Since…well, since Martha passed. It wasn't this bad before, though. Definitely got worse recently. I just figured it was old age creeping in. Is that what it is?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Baide. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, and it’s not uncommon for physical symptoms to arise or worsen during times of stress and loss. While it could be related to that, we need to rule out other potential causes to ensure we're addressing everything appropriately. You mentioned it's mostly in your hand and gets worse with activity. Is it present when you’re resting, or only when you’re trying to do something?
PATIENT: Resting? Hmm. Let me think… …Sometimes. Not all the time, but yeah, I notice it even when I’m just sitting here. It’s…subtle, I guess. But it’s there. More noticeable when I try to, like, hold a fork. Or write. Which I haven’t done in ages, thankfully. Everything’s just easier to ignore when someone else does it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s present at rest and worsens with activity. That gives us a starting point. And you said it's mostly in your hand… does it affect the other side of your body at all?
PATIENT: Nah, just this one. My right hand. Always been my dominant hand, anyway. Left hand’s pretty useless, always has been. Honestly, doc, I’m not a complicated case. It’s just a shaky hand. Can’t you just give me something to stop it? I don't need a whole song and dance about it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Baide. And I assure you, we’ll keep things as straightforward as possible. However, it’s important to understand why your hand is shaking before we consider any treatment options. There are several possibilities, and we want to make sure we’re addressing the correct issue. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m eighty years old, doc, I got plenty of symptoms! Aches, pains, creaky joints…the usual. Honestly, I don’t go around cataloging every little thing that bothers me. It’s just…getting old. Is that what we’re doing here? Talking about how old I am?
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Baide. I apologize if my questions seem tedious. I’m not trying to catalog every ache and pain, but rather to rule out any underlying causes for the shaking that might require specific attention. Perhaps I can ask a more targeted question. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hand or arm?
PATIENT: Stiffness? …Yeah, a little. Especially in the mornings. Takes a while to get it moving. I just figured it was arthritis. Martha had terrible arthritis in her knees. Maybe I inherited it. Is that it? Can you just tell me if it’s arthritis and give me something for it? I really don’t have time for a guessing game.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick answer, Mr. Baide. Arthritis is certainly a possibility, and it’s good you’re thinking about your family history. However, there are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, and it's important to differentiate between them. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Ugh. Look, doc, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve had things. I had that surgery on my hip years ago, and…and I had the flu a couple of times. And I broke my wrist when I was a kid, fell off a bike. Does that matter? I don’t remember all the details. Doctors always want to know about everything, but honestly, it's all a blur. I haven't been to a doctor in…well, a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Baide. We don't need a detailed history if you're not able to recall it. The hip surgery is helpful to know, thank you. Just to clarify, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… Maybe? The doctor mentioned something about it once, years ago. Said I needed to watch my salt intake. But I don’t remember ever taking any pills for it. Diabetes? No, never. I like my sweets, but I don’t think I’m diabetic. Honestly, doc, I just want to know what’s wrong with my hand. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible history of high blood pressure, but not formally diagnosed or treated, and no history of diabetes. We'll make a note of that. To address your concern about whether it's serious, it's unlikely to be immediately life-threatening, but it's important to determine the cause of the shaking to ensure we can manage it effectively and prevent any potential complications. I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and nervous system. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine. Get it over with. Just don't poke and prod too much, alright? I'm an old man, not a science project. And please, hurry it up. I have things to do… well, I would have things to do if I wasn’t sitting here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. And then I’ll have you try to touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed. Just like this. And finally, I’ll just observe your hand at rest and while you perform a few simple movements. Okay, I'm observing a resting tremor in your right hand, as you mentioned. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, and your coordination seems generally intact, although the tremor does make it a bit more challenging. I don’t see any other obvious neurological signs at this time. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the tremor. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. More poking and prodding. Fine, whatever. Just get it done. I don't want to come back here again. Can I at least get a cup of coffee while I wait? This whole thing is making me thirsty. And please, tell me when I can leave.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples right away. And yes, absolutely, I'll have her bring you a cup of coffee while you wait. It will take about fifteen to twenty minutes for the results to come back. The blood tests will help us check for thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and other potential causes of the tremor. Once we have the results, we can discuss them with you and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. And I apologize again for the inconvenience.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. And make sure it's strong coffee. I need something to wake me up after all this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Baide. I’ll make sure the nurse knows you prefer strong coffee. I’ll be back shortly with the results. In the meantime, feel free to relax.
PATIENT: .
