DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Kammann, yes. Sixty-nine… alright. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, it’s good to meet ya. Folks call me Londell. I reckon I’m here for a… what did my daughter call it? A “check-up,” but a more thorough one. She’s been after me to get things… optimized. Said I'm gettin' up there in years and need to make sure everything's still workin' like it should. I’m feelin' alright, mostly, but I don't want to stay alright, ya know? I want to keep bein' alright.
DOCTOR: "Optimized," is it?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s the word she used. Always was a smart one, my Sarah. She reads a lot of those health blogs, I think. I don’t pretend to understand half of it, but she worries. And I appreciate that. She just wants me to be around for a good long time, see her grandkids grow up.
DOCTOR: Right, family history… always a concern. Let’s just… get through this. Any major illnesses in the family?
PATIENT: Well, now, that’s a question. My mother… she had a touch of the diabetes, later in life. Not real bad, but she had to watch her sugar. And her heart wasn’t the strongest, either. My father… he worked hard all his life, out in the fields. Never much sick, but he passed pretty quick when he got old. Just… wore out, I guess. On my wife’s side… she had some trouble with her blood pressure, I remember. Nothing real dramatic, though. We were both pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you… any significant medical problems yourself?
PATIENT: Not much, Doc. Had my share of bumps and bruises workin’ with the tools, you know, etching and engraving. But nothin’ that ever needed more than a bandage and a good night’s sleep. Had the flu a couple times, like everyone else. And my knees ache a bit when it rains, but I figure that's just the weather, bein' an old man. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out, must be twenty years ago now. That was a bit rough, but I recovered alright.
DOCTOR: Twenty years ago. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. They gave me somethin’ for the pain after the gallbladder surgery, and I didn’t have any trouble with it. I've taken some over-the-counter stuff for headaches now and again, too. Never reacted to nothin'. I usually just try to tough things out, to be honest. My mother always said strong folks don't complain.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, Doc. A small pill, once a day. The doc back home prescribed it a couple years ago. Keeps things level, mostly. Nothing else, though. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. Just to... confirm things. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs… the usual. Please, sit here.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you need. I reckon a listenin' and a checkin' is a good idea. I always figured preventative is best.
DOCTOR: 140 over 88. Not terrible, but could be better. Heart rate is… regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are… diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Everything seems… functional. Barely.
PATIENT: "Barely functional," huh? Well, I am gettin’ on, Doc. I reckon things ain’t gonna be as sharp as they used to be. Still, I get around alright. I can still spend a whole day in my workshop without too much trouble. Though my back does complain a bit by the end of it. What do you think, Doc? Anything I ought to be worried about? Is that blood pressure somethin' to fuss over?
DOCTOR: It’s elevated. We should run some blood work. Basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, lipid panel… just to get a baseline. And an EKG. Rule out anything… serious. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Kammann. For someone your age. Don’t fuss.
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG… alright. Sounds sensible enough. My daughter always said I need to get all the tests. She worries about everything, that Sarah. But I reckon it’s better to be safe than sorry. Where do we go from here, Doc? Do I need to go somewhere else for these tests, or can we do ‘em here?
DOCTOR: The lab is right down the hall. They’ll draw the blood. And the technician will do the EKG. Tell them Dr. Ruocco sent you. It’ll take about an hour, probably. Then we’ll review the results. Don’t eat anything heavy before the blood work. Now, are there any other… concerns?
PATIENT: An hour, alright. I can manage that. No heavy eatin’, got it. Hmm… well, now. My sleep ain't been the best lately. I wake up a lot during the night, and it takes me a while to get back to sleep. Not every night, but often enough to bother me. And… … I've been feelin' a little tired, even when I do get enough sleep. Just a little… run down, I reckon. But maybe that's just gettin' old.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and insomnia. Common complaints. Likely stress. We’ll see what the blood work shows. Could be vitamin deficiency. Could be… a lot of things. Don’t fuss. Go get the tests done. And try to relax. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Stress… maybe you're right. Things have been a bit busy lately. Well, I’ll go get those tests done, then. Thank you, Doc. And… thank you for listenin’. Even if you do think I'm just fussin’.
