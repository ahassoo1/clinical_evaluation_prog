DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, it's my throat. It's been… bothering me. Not a pleasant experience, I assure you. I need this sorted quickly, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to get this sorted quickly. We’ll do our best. Your throat is bothering you… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it hurts when I swallow. It's a… a raw feeling. And it feels… thick. Like there’s something stuck. I don’t know what it is, and frankly, I don't have the time to investigate. It just… is. It started a few days ago, I think. Or maybe longer? Dates aren’t really my strong suit since… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, sore throat, pain with swallowing, feeling of thickness… a few days or longer. Okay. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. It dulls sometimes, but it’s always there. Like a… a pebble. A very annoying pebble. And it's worse in the mornings. Naturally. Everything is worse in the morning. I don’t see why you need to know every little detail, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant, worse in the mornings. I ask because details do help. Has the pain radiated anywhere else – your ears, your neck perhaps?
PATIENT: Radiated? Is that… a medical term? Honestly. No, it doesn’t… radiate. It stays right there. In my throat. It's not a complicated ailment, Doctor. And I really must get going soon. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't radiate. Alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven't been taking my temperature, Doctor. I'm not a child. Chills… perhaps a little cold sometimes, but that’s the air conditioning. And aches? Well, I'm 44. Things ache. That's just life. Is this going somewhere or are we simply cataloging the general state of my existence?
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills attributed to air conditioning, and general aches. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: A little cough, sometimes. Dry cough. Not productive. And no, I am not having difficulty breathing. I'm standing here, aren't I? Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking very obvious questions. Are you trying to be thorough, or are you simply filling your time?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem obvious, Ms. Ottaviani. I just want to make sure I have a complete picture. Dry cough, no breathing difficulty. Have you been around anyone who's been sick recently?
PATIENT: Sick people are everywhere, Doctor. Honestly. I work with…people. It's unavoidable. I couldn't possibly recall who might have had a sniffle when. It's… irrelevant. I haven’t been paying attention to the ailments of my coworkers. I have more important things to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known exposure to anyone specifically sick. Let’s just quickly go over some medical history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past – anything like asthma, allergies, or a weakened immune system?
PATIENT: Weakened immune system? Certainly not. I've always been… robust. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing significant. And no, I don’t have allergies. I eat everything. Some people just have stronger constitutions, Doctor. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy, except for this dreadful throat. And, if you don't mind, I was widowed five years ago. I don’t know if that’s relevant, but everyone asks.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant medical problems, usual childhood illnesses, no allergies, widowed five years ago. I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Ottaviani, it can be relevant. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I prefer to rely on my own strength, thank you very much. I do not believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals. Perhaps a little throat lozenge now and then, but nothing regular. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tiresome. Are we getting anywhere with this, or should I just find another practitioner?
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, occasional throat lozenge. Okay. Let's take a quick look at your throat, just to get a visual assessment. Can you open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Aaaah. There. Happy now? Honestly, it's not exactly a pleasant sight, I assure you. A perfectly good throat, ruined by… something. Just get on with it, Doctor. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is a little red, some slight swelling of the tonsils, but no obvious exudate or lesions. Your uvula looks normal. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. It's possible this is a viral pharyngitis - a common sore throat. However, because of the slight lymph node enlargement, I'd like to be cautious. I'm going to order a rapid strep test, just to rule out a bacterial infection. It's a quick swab. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Swab? Honestly. A swab? Must you inflict further indignities upon me? Fine. Do it quickly. But if it's negative, I expect a full explanation and a plan to alleviate this… discomfort. And I still maintain this is probably just a slight irritation. Honestly, Doctor, people get sore throats. It’s hardly a medical crisis. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. This will only take a moment. There. All done. It'll take about 5-10 minutes for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend you drink plenty of fluids, and you can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if needed. We'll discuss options further once we have the results.
PATIENT: Five to ten minutes? Honestly. Very well. I suppose I'll just sit here and waste my valuable time. But if this is negative, I expect a clear explanation for why I'm feeling this way, and some advice beyond "drink fluids." This is unacceptable. Don't you have anything better to do than swab the throats of perfectly healthy, albeit slightly inconvenienced, people? Honestly.
DOCTOR: We strive to provide thorough care, Ms. Ottaviani. I understand your frustration with the wait. While we wait for the results, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, have I not made myself clear? No. I have no allergies. I told you. I do not take medications. This is… exhausting. Is there a chair that is more comfortable? My back is beginning to ache, and this whole experience is simply adding to my woes. Honestly, must I endure this further discomfort?
DOCTOR: Please, feel free to sit there. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let’s just try to remain calm until we have the test results. It's important to rule out anything serious before proceeding. Ah. The results are back. It's negative for strep. That's good news. It’s likely a viral pharyngitis, which means it will resolve on its own with supportive care.
PATIENT: Negative? Finally. I told you it was nothing serious. Honestly, all this fuss over a simple sore throat. Supportive care? What does that mean, exactly? Do I simply lie down and hope it goes away? That is hardly a plan. And what about the discomfort? Must I endure that indefinitely? Honestly, Doctor, I expected… more. Is there anything at all you can suggest to alleviate this… unpleasantness? A lozenge, perhaps? A stronger lozenge? Honestly, this is unacceptable.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for more, Ms. Ottaviani. While a viral pharyngitis typically resolves on its own, there are things we can do to manage the symptoms. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, as we discussed – ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day can help soothe the throat. And yes, a soothing lozenge, perhaps one with menthol or benzocaine, can provide temporary relief. I'm going to print out a sheet with these recommendations, as well as some warning signs to watch for – such as difficulty breathing or a high fever – that would warrant a return visit or immediate medical attention. I understand this isn't what you hoped for, and I apologize for the inconvenience. It's important to rule out anything serious, and fortunately, that’s what we’ve done. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Salt water? Honestly. Very well. I suppose I have no choice. And warning signs? I am perfectly capable of recognizing a medical crisis, thank you very much. I’ve lived a full life, Doctor. And yes, I have one final question. Will this…incident…be documented on my medical record? I have certain…concerns about the implications. Honestly, this is all quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, this visit will be documented in your medical record. It’s standard procedure to record all consultations, even those with negative findings. The documentation will include the reason for your visit, the examination findings, the negative strep test result, and the recommendations for symptomatic treatment. It's important for continuity of care, should you require medical attention in the future. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
