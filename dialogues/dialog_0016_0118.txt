DOCTOR: Hi Venard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, well. I believe it’s… a certification, isn’t it? One must keep up appearances, you understand. It’s… required for my line of work. Though, frankly, I haven’t the foggiest what exactly needs certifying. Something to do with seeing and hearing, I suppose. It’s all rather tedious, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a certification physical. I see. And you said something about seeing and hearing… so it sounds like we’re doing a check-up for your vision and hearing as part of this requirement. Just to clarify, is there a specific form or organization that requires this certification?
PATIENT: A form? Oh, dear. No, I haven’t the slightest. Honestly, my… ex-wife usually handled all these bureaucratic matters. She was quite… organized. I simply received a notice, and I’m here, aren’t I? It's all terribly inconvenient, but one must comply with… regulations. Is that sufficient? I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have… arrangements.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. We can certainly figure it out. It sounds like you may not have the specific form with you, which is no problem at all. We can still do a thorough check-up and I can document the findings; often, that's enough. Do you recall who sent the notice, even a company name?
PATIENT: A company name… hmm. It was… blue, I think? The paper was blue. And there were… letters. Official-looking letters. Perhaps… Associated… something? No, that doesn’t sound right. Honestly, I’ve a terrible memory for such details. It's just… all rather unimportant, isn’t it? As long as I get the certification, I don’t particularly care who sent the notice. It was official. Blue paper. That must be enough, surely?
DOCTOR: Okay, "official, blue paper notice" is a good start. It does sound like a standard certification requirement. We can proceed with the exam even without the exact company name. To make sure I cover everything, let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no. I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. Diabetes? High blood pressure? Those are… ailments for those who don’t prioritize their health. I’ve always been quite robust, thank you very much. I may be… seasoned, but I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate. Though… I did have a touch of the flu a few years ago. A minor touch. And my knees ache a bit in the cold weather. But that's simply… aging, isn’t it? Nothing a sensible man hasn't experienced.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major medical conditions, occasional knee pain, and a past episode of the flu. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. There was that… incident. Years ago, of course. A rather unfortunate mishap involving a… woodworking project. My ex-wife insisted I take up a hobby. A complete disaster, if you ask me. I believe they… patched me up. A few stitches, I think. Nothing serious. A minor laceration, really. And… oh, yes! I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was quite young. But that’s hardly… noteworthy, is it? Standard procedure. Really, I’ve been quite fortunate in avoiding any significant medical interventions.
DOCTOR: Okay, wisdom teeth removal and a laceration repair. Good to know. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? A rather… unremarkable affair, if I’m honest. My father was a stoic Norwegian fisherman – a man of few words, and excellent constitution. My mother… well, she was a homemaker. Rather frail, actually. She passed away at a respectable age, I suppose. As for illnesses… I believe my uncle had something to do with… gout? And my cousin… oh dear, what was it? Some sort of… nerves? No, it escapes me. It's really all rather unimportant. I wasn't terribly close to either of them. A quiet, unremarkable lineage, really. Nothing of consequence.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant family history reported. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Absolutely not. I have a rather… refined palate, you understand. I don’t consume anything artificial or… questionable. As for medications… I avoid them whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, thank you very much. Though… I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a bee sting when I was a boy. A bit of swelling, nothing dramatic. But a bee sting is hardly an allergy, is it? Simply a… nuisance. No, I am generally immune to… discomfort. A strong constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies except for a bee sting reaction. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Good heavens, no. I told you, I prefer natural remedies. Vitamins… Occasionally, I’ll have a glass of orange juice. For the Vitamin C, you understand. A sensible precaution. Supplements? Absolutely not. I get all the nutrients I require from a balanced diet. Though… my neighbor recommended some sort of… fish oil capsule. For the joints, apparently. I believe it's still in the cupboard. I haven’t gotten around to trying it yet. Frankly, I doubt it would be of much benefit. I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I am… self-sufficient. No, I do not rely on… artificial enhancements.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venard, that gives me a good overview. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. We’ll check your vision, hearing, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, I’ve always been rather sensitive to… bright lights. And loud noises, naturally. A delicate constitution, you see. But proceed, by all means. Just… be gentle, will you? I have… commitments. And I’d prefer to maintain a certain level of… composure. Let’s get this over with, shall we? The sooner it's finished, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We can adjust the lighting and volume as needed. First, let's check your vision. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I assure you, my eyesight is perfectly adequate. I still manage to read the newspaper without assistance, you know. But proceed, if you must. Don't expect miracles, though. I haven't the patience for… intricate examinations. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking straight ahead. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Is this truly necessary? Very well. Let me see… E… F… P… Is that correct? Is this some sort of trick? The letters are rather… blurry. Perhaps the lighting is the issue. Or the chart itself. It appears to be… slightly askew. Are you certain this is calibrated correctly? It's all rather… imprecise.
DOCTOR: You're right, let's adjust the lighting. And I've adjusted the chart as well. Now, let’s try again. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Honestly. It's still… indistinct. Is that a 'P'? Or a 'Q'? It's terribly difficult to discern. Perhaps if you spoke louder? No, that wouldn't help, would it? The letters themselves are the issue. Are you certain these are standard letters? They appear… oddly shaped. I suspect my vision is perfectly fine. It's this… equipment that's at fault. Are you absolutely certain you know what you’re doing? This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. It appears there is some difficulty with visual acuity, even with adjustments. We'll document that. I'm noting some decreased visual acuity bilaterally. Now, let’s check your hearing. I’m going to place these headphones on, and I’ll play some tones at different frequencies. Please tell me when you hear a tone, even if it’s very faint. Okay?
PATIENT: Headphones? Honestly. Must we endure this endless barrage of… contraptions? Very well. But I warn you, my hearing is quite sensitive. Loud noises are… distressing. And I suspect this will be nothing more than a futile exercise. Proceed, if you must. But do be gentle. I have… important engagements. And I’d rather not be subjected to any unnecessary… unpleasantness. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m starting with a low frequency. Just tell me when you hear a tone. Any sound at all, even a faint one. And don't hesitate, just raise your hand when you hear something.
PATIENT: Silence. Utter silence. I hear nothing. Absolutely nothing. Are you certain this device is functioning correctly? It's quite possible it's… broken. Honestly, this is a complete waste of time. I have perfectly good hearing, thank you very much. I can hear the birds chirping outside, can't you? A faint, melodious tune. But this… contraption? Utterly useless. Perhaps if you could turn it up a bit? Just a little. Though I suspect it's simply… defective.
DOCTOR: Okay. No response to low frequencies bilaterally. I'm noting decreased hearing at low frequencies bilaterally. Now, let’s try some higher frequencies. This might help us pinpoint where the difficulty lies. Can you hear anything now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… rather shrill. Unpleasant, actually. A high-pitched whine. It’s… disturbing. No, I hear nothing useful. Just a… grating noise. Are you certain this is safe? It feels as though my eardrums are vibrating. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite unwell. Perhaps we should discontinue this… experiment. I assure you, my hearing is perfectly adequate for everyday conversation. But this… torturous assault on my auditory senses? It's quite unnecessary. And frankly, rather rude. No, I hear nothing of consequence. Just a… piercing squeal. Stop, please. Stop it now.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I've stopped the test. I apologize for any discomfort. It seems there is significant difficulty with hearing across multiple frequencies. Now, let's just check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Finally. Something simple. Though I do hope you've calibrated that device correctly as well. I have a perfectly normal blood pressure, you understand. I maintain a healthy lifestyle. And my pulse is… steady. A reliable indicator of good health. Though I must warn you, I do tend to get a little… agitated during these… examinations. It tends to elevate it slightly. But proceed, if you must. Just… be quick about it. And gentle, please. One can never be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is reading 150/90. And your pulse is 88 and regular, but slightly elevated. I’m noting elevated blood pressure and slightly elevated pulse. Alright, Venard, based on the examination, we have decreased visual acuity bilaterally, decreased hearing across multiple frequencies, and elevated blood pressure and a slightly elevated pulse. I recommend follow-up with an ophthalmologist for a more detailed vision assessment and an audiologist for a hearing evaluation. Given the elevated blood pressure, I also recommend a consultation with a cardiologist. Would you like me to provide referrals for those specialists?
PATIENT: Specialists? Cardiologists? Ophthalmologists? Good heavens, no. This is… preposterous. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. A few minor aches and pains are simply a sign of… maturity. I do not require the attention of a multitude of… specialists. This is simply a waste of time and… money. Honestly, I suspect this entire examination is… flawed. Utterly and completely flawed. No, thank you. I decline your… recommendations. I prefer to manage my own health. Perhaps a glass of orange juice will suffice. And a long nap. Yes, that’s precisely what I require. A long nap. No, thank you. I’ll be on my way. This has been… most unpleasant. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Venard. I understand. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. These are important findings that warrant further investigation. I’ll document the examination results and provide you with a summary of my concerns. I can provide the referral information if you change your mind. Do you require a work/school note for this visit?
