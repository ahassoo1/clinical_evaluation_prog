DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Please, call me Elijiah. Well, it’s kinda… weird, to be honest. I’m havin’ trouble gettin’ out of chairs. Like, I can sit down fine, but when I go to stand up… it just takes a lot more effort than it used to. And sometimes, I gotta really push with my arms to get goin’. It’s been goin’ on for a couple weeks now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty rising from a seated position… and requiring assistance with your arms, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's about it. Not every time, mind you. Like, a sturdy wooden chair, no problem. But these softer ones, or… those fancy office chairs? Forget about it. Feels like I’m stuck or somethin’. And it’s not a pain, exactly. More like… a strain, I guess. A real effort. I work out in the oil fields, so I'm used to strain, but this is different.
DOCTOR: Oil fields, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roustabout work mostly. It’s hard on the body, no doubt. Lots of liftin’, movin’ stuff around, long hours on my feet… I’m used to bein’ sore, but this ain’t a soreness thing. It’s like somethin’s… stuck. You know? And it's not gettin' better, that's for sure. I don’t want it to turn into somethin’ serious. I lost my wife a couple years back, and… well, I don’t really have anyone to help me out if I do get hurt. That's why I came in.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Fratoni. Losing a spouse is… difficult, and it’s wise to address these issues promptly. So, to clarify, this difficulty specifically arises when standing from softer chairs, and is present for approximately two weeks?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. Two weeks, give or take. And it’s worse with the soft ones, but it happens with most chairs now if I’ve been sittin’ for a while. Like, if I get up right away, no problem. But if I’m relaxin’, watchin’ TV or somethin’… that’s when it gets tricky. And it ain't just at home, either. I noticed it at the diner the other day, too. A booth seat, vinyl, but still… hard to get goin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any pain in your hips, lower back, or legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back gets tired after a long day at work, like always. But it’s not a sharp pain, or anything different than usual. And my legs feel fine. No pain there. It’s… hard to explain. It's like the effort it takes is just… higher than it should be. It doesn't hurt to stand up, it just… takes a lot to get started. Does that make sense? I don’t wanna sound crazy.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound “crazy,” Mr. Fratoni. It's important to describe your symptoms as accurately as possible. Now, let’s run through a quick review of systems, just to ensure we’re not overlooking anything. Have you experienced any weakness in your legs, or any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Nope, no weakness, numbness, or tingly feelings. Legs work just fine. I'm able to walk, climb, lift… everything feels normal while I’m doin’ it. It's just that first push off the chair. Like somethin’s stuck, maybe in my hips? I don’t know. I've never had anything like this before. I’m usually pretty healthy, honestly. Work hard, eat okay… this is kinda throwin’ me for a loop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a sec. Now that’s a question. Uh… no, not really. Everything's pretty normal down there, if you don’t mind me sayin’. Why are you askin’ about that? Does that have somethin’ to do with bein’ stuck? I mean, I appreciate you checkin’ everything, but… that feels kinda unrelated. No changes at all, doc. Sorry to be blunt.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Fratoni, to inquire about all relevant bodily functions to establish a comprehensive understanding of your condition. It is simply to rule out any underlying causes. Now, let’s move on. Any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, I get it. Standard procedure. Just feels kinda… personal, you know? Alright, no fever, no chills, and no weight loss. I'm actually holdin' pretty steady weight-wise, maybe even put on a couple pounds. Workin' hard does that to a fella. And I ain’t been sick at all. Just this chair thing. It's been botherin' me enough to come see a doctor, and that’s sayin’ somethin’. I usually just tough things out.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you currently take any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope, not a one. I don't like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Just vitamins sometimes, if I remember. But nothing regular. I’m usually pretty good about takin’ care of myself. Mostly just hard work and tryin’ to eat right. I keep a bottle of ibuprofen in my truck, for headaches or if I pull somethin’ at work, but I don’t use it often. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Fratoni, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I will need you to stand and walk a few steps for me, and then I’d like to check your range of motion and strength in your hips and legs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need, Doc. Just tell me what to do. I can stand up, walk, all that. I ain't afraid of a little exam. Hopefully you can figure out what's goin' on with these chairs. It's kinda startin’ to worry me, you know? Just bein' stuck like that… feels kinda weak.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, if you’ll follow me to the examination table. First, let’s start with your gait. Just walk normally across the room, and I’ll observe your movements. When you reach that wall, turn around and walk back.
PATIENT: Alright, here I go. Just walkin' normal, like always. Long strides, gotta cover some ground. Hope I don’t look too awkward. Oil field work ain’t exactly known for gracefulness. How’d I do? Anything obvious lookin’ wrong?
DOCTOR: Your gait appears generally normal, though there is a slight hesitancy upon initiation. Now, please, lie down on the examination table. I’m going to assess your hip range of motion. I will gently move your legs in various directions. Please inform me if you experience any pain. Can you feel any discomfort with this movement?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Uh, no, not really. Feels kinda normal. A little bit of a stretch, maybe, but nothin’ painful. Just feels like I’m gettin’ old. Ooh, that one's a little tight. Not pain, exactly, but definitely a stretch. Like somethin’s kinda… stuck in there. Does that make sense? It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: I see. Limited range of motion in external rotation, and some resistance to passive movement. Now, I'm going to palpate your hips and lower back to assess for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly sore. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, right there. That’s kinda tender. Not sharp pain, but definitely sensitive. Like a deep ache. The rest feels okay, though. Lower back’s a little stiff, but that’s normal after a long day at work. But yeah, that spot on my right hip… definitely feels somethin’ there. Right around there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any clicking or popping sensations in your hip when you move it?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, yeah, maybe. Just a little pop sometimes, when I swing my leg around. It doesn't hurt or anything, just a little click. I figured it was just my joints, you know? Old workin' joints. It ain't nothin' I've ever worried about before. But yeah, I think I do hear a little pop sometimes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Fratoni. Based on my examination, it appears you may be experiencing hip impingement, also known as femoroacetabular impingement, or FAI. This occurs when there is abnormal contact between the femur and the acetabulum – the socket in your hip. The limited range of motion, tenderness, and clicking sensation are all consistent with this condition. However, to confirm this diagnosis, we will need to obtain an X-ray of your hip. Would you be willing to proceed with an X-ray?
PATIENT: Hip… what now? Impingement? That sounds serious. I ain’t ever heard of that before. And an X-ray? Is it… bad? Like, is somethin’ broken? I mean, I can walk, work… I just have trouble gettin' out of chairs. I didn't think it was somethin' that needed an X-ray. But… if you think it's necessary, Doc, then yeah, I guess so. If you think it'll tell us what's goin’ on, then do it. But I hope it's nothin’ too serious. I can’t afford to be laid up, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Fratoni. An X-ray will help us to visualize the bones in your hip and determine the extent of any abnormalities. It is a standard diagnostic procedure, and it is not painful. While the X-ray will help confirm the diagnosis, it's important to understand that FAI exists on a spectrum. Mild cases may be managed with conservative treatment, such as physical therapy and activity modification. More severe cases may require further intervention, such as injections or surgery. Let's proceed with the X-ray first. I will send the order to radiology, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms, such as prolonged sitting and deep squatting. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Surgery? You said surgery… that’s kinda scary. I don’t want no surgery, Doc. Is that… likely? I mean, I can still work. I just gotta… be careful. And avoid sittin’ for too long, you say? That’s gonna be hard, since I drive a truck for a livin’. So, surgery is… a possibility? And what kinda physical therapy are we talkin’ about? Is it gonna be expensive? I don’t have insurance, so… everything costs money. I’m just tryin’ to figure out what I’m lookin’ at here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Fratoni, it’s important to understand that surgery is not necessarily the first course of action. As I mentioned, many cases of FAI are managed successfully with conservative treatment. We need to obtain the X-ray results first to determine the severity of your condition and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Physical therapy typically involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your hip and improve your range of motion. The cost of physical therapy can vary depending on your location and the number of sessions required. I can provide you with a list of physical therapy clinics in the area, and you can contact them directly to inquire about their fees. I will also provide you with a referral to an orthopedic specialist. They will be able to review the X-ray results and discuss all of your treatment options with you in detail. It’s important to remember that we are taking this one step at a time. We will start with the X-ray, and then we will develop a plan that is tailored to your specific needs and circumstances. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, one step at a time. That sounds better. An orthopedic specialist, huh? I guess that makes sense. I don’t wanna jump to conclusions. Just… try to avoid surgery if possible. And you said they can tell me about costs? That's important. I guess… no, not right now. Just… get the X-ray, see what the specialist says. And try not to sit for too long. Easier said than done, but I'll try. Thank you, Doc. For explainin' everything. I appreciate it. I’ll wait for the radiology folks to call. Hopefully, it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Fratoni. I have sent the referral to radiology, and they should be contacting you within the next few days to schedule an appointment. This slip also contains the contact information for a highly-rated orthopedic specialist in the area. I understand your concerns about costs, and I recommend discussing financial options with the specialist's office. They may offer payment plans or other assistance programs. In the meantime, continue to avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms, and please don't hesitate to contact my office if you experience any worsening pain or discomfort. I wish you all the best, Mr. Fratoni. We will follow up once we receive the X-ray results.
PATIENT: .
