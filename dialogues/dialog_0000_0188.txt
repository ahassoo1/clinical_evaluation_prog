DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Secondi. Criston, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Criston Secondi.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Criston, you’re a… a substantial man. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it does factor into things. Now, tell me, what brings you in here today?
PATIENT: It’s my… pee. It’s orange. It started a few days ago. Not all the time, but… yeah. Orange. My wife, she said I should come see someone. She got worried.
DOCTOR: Orange, you say. Hmm. And how much fluid are you taking in a day, Criston?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know exactly. I drink water when I’m thirsty. Maybe… two, three bottles? The big ones. I work outside, it gets hot. I sweat a lot. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It matters, Criston. Everything matters. Two or three large bottles… that’s not a lot for a man of your size, especially with outdoor work. Tell me, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. Just… the color. It scared my wife. She said it could be… something bad. I don’t usually worry about things like this. But she… she got really worried.
DOCTOR: Wives are often prone to unnecessary alarm, Criston. However, we should rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes… like what? I go to the toilet normally. Not… stuck, or anything. Maybe a little darker than usual, sometimes? I eat a lot of… vegetables. Dark green ones. Does that make the… stuff darker? I don’t know. I don’t really pay attention. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful that you're being forthcoming, Criston. Darker stools can be related to diet, yes, but we need to consider other possibilities. Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. And no pain in my belly. Nothing like that. I feel… normal, except for the color of my pee. It just looks… wrong. Like, really orange. Like juice, almost. My wife, she said maybe I need to drink more water. I tried, but it didn’t really help.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your records… hmm. Okay. Height, weight… as expected. No prior medical history noted, which is… unusual for a man your age, but alright. Do you take any medications, vitamins, or supplements at all, Criston?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills. My wife sometimes tries to give me vitamins, but I usually forget to take them. Just… water and food. Normal food. I eat a lot of… tagine. And couscous. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Everything matters, Criston. Tagine… couscous… Right. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. We'll start with your abdomen. Lie back on the examination table, please. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax… yes, I’ll try. It’s just… I don’t like doctors very much. No offense.
DOCTOR: No acute tenderness, thankfully. Bowel sounds are present, though a bit sluggish. No distention or masses that I can feel. Now, let’s check your hydration. Skin turgor is a little diminished… not drastically, but enough to suggest mild dehydration. I’m going to order a urinalysis, just to see what's going on with your urine. And a basic metabolic panel, to check your kidney function and electrolytes. It’s standard procedure, Criston. Don't worry.
PATIENT: Okay. A pee test… and… what was the other one? My kidneys? Is something wrong with my kidneys? I feel fine, really. Just the orange pee. It’s probably just… water, right? I’ll drink more water. A lot of water.
DOCTOR: We don't know anything yet, Criston. That's why we're running the tests. It could be something simple like dehydration, yes. Or it could be something else. The basic metabolic panel will give us a better idea of your kidney function. And the urinalysis will check for infection, blood, or other abnormalities. It's not necessarily cause for alarm, but we need to be thorough. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. Blood and… pee. I understand. Okay. Blood and pee. It’s just… a lot. My wife is going to be very relieved we're doing something. She worries too much, but… she means well. Can I sit down now?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, sit down. The nurse will be with you shortly. And honestly, Criston, a little worry from your wife is preferable to ignoring something that could be serious. Now, while we wait, is there anything else at all – anything – you haven’t told me?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well… I started a new job last month. It's… a lot more physical than my old one. Lifting things, digging… I take some pain pills sometimes, for my back. Just when it really hurts. Not every day. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called? I buy it at the store. Does that matter? I forgot to mention that. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Just… when my back hurts. Like, after lifting heavy things at work. Not a lot. Maybe… two or three pills at a time, when it’s really bad. I didn't think it was important. It's just over-the-counter. My wife… she keeps telling me to tell you everything. I should have said something earlier. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Criston, you need to understand. Everything is important. Over-the-counter medications can still interact with other conditions or cause side effects. Ibuprofen, especially with regular use, can affect your kidneys. It’s why we ask about everything. Now, how often are you taking this ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Well… maybe… three or four times a week. Sometimes five, if it's a really busy week at work. It helps with the pain, you see. I don’t want to slow down. I need the money. My wife… she worries about my back, but she also wants me to work. It’s complicated. I didn't think it was a big deal. I just wanted to get back to work. Sorry. I should have told you sooner. Really sorry.
DOCTOR: Criston, we are going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and a kidney function test. And frankly, I’m concerned enough that I want to see you back here in three days to review the results. Taking ibuprofen at that frequency is… irresponsible, and it could be causing damage. And you need to be honest with me – and with your wife – about your pain levels and medication use. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. Three days. Blood tests. And… stop the pills. I understand. Okay. I’ll stop the pills. And I’ll tell my wife. I’m sorry for not telling you everything sooner. I just… I didn’t want to make a fuss. I’ll see you in three days.
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you a container for the urine sample. And Criston… please, try to rest your back as much as possible until we have the results. And drink plenty of water. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor Batara. I will.
