DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, okay? I just... I'm tired. Really tired. And I've been... eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I get this feeling and... well, you get it. It's embarrassing. Just want something to fix it, quick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing significant fatigue and... an unusual craving. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of this. It’s not embarrassing to seek help, Ms. Cantoran, and I appreciate you being open with me. First, let's talk about the tiredness. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I'm tired. Like, all the time. Doesn't matter if I sleep eight hours, doesn't matter if I only get four. It’s just… there. Been going on for months, I guess. Maybe longer. Hard to keep track these days. I work, I eat, I sleep... repeat. Not much else going on, if you want the truth. And it’s getting worse. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, that’s not too much to ask at all. We’ll work together to figure this out. Months of persistent fatigue, even with adequate sleep, is concerning. Let's try to pinpoint some details. When did you first notice this fatigue becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It's all a blur. Probably… last fall, maybe? Around the time… around the time my husband… never mind. It was a rough time. Everything feels foggy before that, and after. I was… distracted. It just sort of… gradually got worse, I guess. I thought it was just grief, you know? But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s just… stayed. Really stayed.
DOCTOR: I understand. Experiencing loss is incredibly difficult, and it can absolutely affect your energy levels and overall well-being for a long time. It’s important to acknowledge that. It sounds like the fatigue started around that time and hasn’t improved, despite the passage of time. Now, you also mentioned…eating dirt. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't make me. It’s… disgusting, okay? I don't want to do it. It just… feels like I need it sometimes. A craving, I guess. Like something's missing. It's usually clay-like dirt, from the garden. I try to find clean stuff, but… it's dirt. And I know it's bad for me. My mother used to tell me stories about people doing that, and it never ended well. But I can’t stop sometimes. It helps, for a little while. Then I feel guilty. It's a whole mess.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so honest with me, Ms. Cantoran. It takes courage to discuss something like that. This craving for dirt—specifically clay-like dirt—is something we need to investigate further. It's called pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, although there are other possibilities as well. Besides the clay, are you craving any other unusual things?
PATIENT: Ugh, pica? Sounds awful. No, just the dirt. Nothing else. I eat regular food, okay? I’m not… crazy. I just… get this feeling, and then I need the dirt. It’s like a… a pull. And then, after, I feel a little better. Not good, just… less bad. I eat mostly beans, tortillas, some chicken when I can afford it. Nothing fancy. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Ms. Cantoran. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. And you're absolutely not crazy. Pica is a recognized condition. You mentioned beans and tortillas, and chicken when you can afford it. That gives me a good starting point. Let's talk about your diet a little more in detail. Do you eat a lot of red meat?
PATIENT: Ugh, red meat? No. Too expensive. Rarely. Maybe a few times a year, for special occasions. Mostly chicken, like I said, or sometimes fish if it's on sale. I try to eat healthy, but… healthy is expensive. I drink water, mostly. Sometimes soda, but I try not to. Look, I'm a computer programmer, okay? Not a nutritionist. I just need to be able to work. This fatigue is making it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Your work requires concentration, and fatigue is certainly a hindrance. Being a computer programmer, you understand the importance of identifying the root cause of a problem. We're trying to do the same thing here. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history? Not much to tell. I had the flu a few times, like everyone else. Nothing serious. When my husband got sick… that was serious, but that wasn't me being sick. I had… some problems with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay, just watch my salt. That's about it. I don't really go to the doctor much. Too expensive, too time-consuming.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Cantoran. A history of blood pressure issues is important to note. And I understand your concerns about cost and time. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Never been a fan. I used to take something for headaches, a long time ago, but it didn’t really work. So I just… deal with the headaches. I try to drink enough water, get enough sleep… it doesn’t always help, but that’s about it. Look, are we almost done? I really need to get back to work. I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're getting close. Just a few more questions, then we'll do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little gas from beans sometimes, but that's just… beans. Look, I'm telling you, I just need to feel less tired and stop craving dirt. Is there a pill for that?
DOCTOR: We’ll work towards that goal, Ms. Cantoran. We need to identify the cause of these symptoms first. Okay, last question regarding your history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history? Honestly? Not that I know of. My mother had… some problems with her stomach, but she didn't really talk about it. My father was healthy as a horse, until he wasn't. Then… well, you know. It’s not something we really discussed. Look, can we just skip this part? It’s all just… foggy. I don’t remember much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cantoran. We can skip that part. It’s understandable that it's difficult to recall. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. But hurry, okay? I have things to do. And be gentle. I don't like doctors poking around.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 135/85. Slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Throat appears normal, no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. I’m just checking your thyroid gland... doesn’t feel enlarged. Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Everything appears generally normal on the physical exam. However, given your fatigue and the unusual craving for dirt, I would like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your iron levels, complete blood count, vitamin D levels, and thyroid function. It’s important to rule out any underlying deficiencies or imbalances.
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests? Seriously? More poking around? Fine. But how long will it take? And will it be expensive? I don't have a lot of money, you know. Just tell me what I need to do, get it over with, and hopefully, fix this problem. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cantoran. The blood tests will take about 15-20 minutes. We'll send them to the lab, and the results should be back in 3-5 business days. Regarding the cost, I know you're concerned about finances. Let me check our pricing and see if we have any programs or discounts available for uninsured patients. I can also write a request for a financial assistance form if needed. We'll work something out to make this affordable. In the meantime, I want you to try to avoid eating any dirt. I know it's difficult, but it's important to stop for now so we can get an accurate reading on your nutrient levels. I'll have the lab draw the blood, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. No dirt. I’ll try. But if I start feeling really bad, I’m blaming you, okay? And check about the money. Seriously. I can't afford a huge bill. Just… get it over with. Where do I go for the blood tests? And can I get a receipt?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cantoran. I understand your concerns, and I'll do everything I can to make this process as smooth as possible. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. I’ll write you a lab order and a receipt. I’ll also let the lab technician know you’re coming and about your concerns regarding the bill. They’ll have information on payment options available. Here’s the lab order and the receipt. After you have the blood work done, just call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll discuss the results and come up with a plan. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Just… get it done. Thanks, I guess. Stop craving dirt... easy for you to say.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Cantoran. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
