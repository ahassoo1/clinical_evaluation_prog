DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… fitness check. For… refereeing. Need paper say I okay. Quick, if possible? Wife… passed last year. Just me now. Don’t have much time to… be here.
DOCTOR: A “fitness check,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes. For… sports. Basketball, mostly. Need to make sure I can run… and not fall over. They want doctor say I good to go. Is that… okay? Is that what you do?
DOCTOR: Well, technically I am an Internal Medicine specialist. But a basic assessment… is within my capabilities. Though I must say, relying on a cursory examination for something as… physically demanding as refereeing seems rather foolish. But, alright. Let's begin. First, tell me, have you experienced any… unusual fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Hmm… Not really. Maybe… tired after work. But work is hard. Fix furnaces all day. Heavy. Not… sick tired. Just… work tired. Does that make sense? I sleep okay. Most nights.
DOCTOR: “Work tired” is not a medical diagnosis, Mr. Shanor. Nevertheless. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No chest pain. Nothing. Sometimes… back hurts. From bending. But not chest. Never chest. Everything okay with heart. I think. Had checkup… years ago. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: “Years ago” is not particularly helpful. And “think” is… concerning. Alright. Have you noticed any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Maybe… when run fast. But that’s normal, right? Old man running. Not like… when sitting. Always can breathe when sit. Never feel like… can’t get air. Okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, “okay.” Let’s move on. Any dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: No. Never dizzy. Sometimes… head a little funny after stand up quick. But not… spinning. Just… whoosh. Goes away. Old man stuff. Like everything else. Quick, can we… finish soon? Just need paper.
DOCTOR: Yes, quickly. Very well. Any palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal…what? Sorry, Doctor. Not sure what that word mean. Heart… beat fast sometimes. When… scared. Or after run. But not… bad. Just… normal, I think. Does that count? Pal…what you say?
DOCTOR: Palpitations. A fluttering or racing sensation in your chest. Nevermind. It appears we’re having some… communication difficulties. Let’s just proceed to a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale. And remove your shoes.
PATIENT: Okay. Shoes off. Scale… right there? Just want paper. Refereeing is important. Need to make sure kids are safe. Not… young anymore. But still got good eyes.
DOCTOR: One hundred and thirty-four kilograms. And one hundred and seventy-four centimeters. Rather… substantial. Blood pressure is… acceptable. Heart sounds are… regular, though a bit… labored. I’ll note that. Abdomen is soft. No obvious tenderness. Now, if you could just… extend your arms. I need to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Arms out. Quick taps? Just need paper. Refereeing is… important to me. Makes me feel… useful. Don’t want to… fall over in front of everyone. Especially the kids.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… present. Though somewhat diminished. And… yes, I observed your… display. It's unnecessary, Mr. Shanor. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Very well. Based on this… cursory examination, you appear to be… minimally functional. I will write a note stating you are cleared for “moderate physical activity.” But I strongly advise against overexertion. And I recommend a full cardiac workup. Preferably soon.
PATIENT: Moderate… is good. Enough for refereeing. Cardiac…workup sounds expensive. I… don’t have much money. Just need paper. Is… paper ready now? Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a very basic clearance note. It states you are “fit for limited physical exertion.” Do not interpret this as a comprehensive medical evaluation. And I reiterate, a cardiac workup is highly recommended. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Good day, Mr. Shanor. And please, be careful.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Limited… is enough. Thank you very much. Refereeing… important. .
