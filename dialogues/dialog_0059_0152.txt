DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol was a little high, so I thought I should come and get it checked out. Hyper… something, I think the letter said. I don't really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here it mentions elevated cholesterol. Hyperlipidemia, that’s the term. It essentially means you have a higher than optimal amount of cholesterol in your blood. Don’t worry, it’s very common, and we can certainly look into it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you’ve had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, no. I feel pretty good, actually. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I walk every morning, and I eat… well, I try to eat healthy. I like my sweets, though, I have to admit. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it's not "bad" at all, Ms. Geho. It's quite common to enjoy sweets. We all do sometimes! It's about finding a balance. And feeling tired is very general, so we'll explore that a bit further as well. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I haven't really had much trouble, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and things like that, but nothing serious. My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, and my dad… he had heart problems, I think. But that was a long time ago. I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago, but other than that… pretty healthy. I see my dentist twice a year, if that counts!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Geho. Family history of hypertension and heart problems is certainly relevant, so thank you for sharing that. And yes, regular dental visits absolutely count! Now, regarding your gallbladder removal – did you experience any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. It was all very smooth. I was in the hospital for a couple of days, but everything healed up nicely. The doctor – Dr. Van Derlyn, a really good man – said it was routine. I was a little uncomfortable afterwards, but nothing major. I was back to walking within a week, I think. It was… 2015, maybe? It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s reassuring to hear. So, no long-term issues following the cholecystectomy. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin every day, just a basic one. And sometimes, when my knees are bothering me, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it. Nothing regular, really. Oh! And sometimes I’ll take fish oil, I heard it’s good for your heart. But I don't always remember. I’m terrible with remembering those sorts of things, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Geho. Many people find it difficult to keep track of supplements. It’s helpful that you’ve mentioned them, though. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I’ve taken lots of different medicines over the years for colds and things, and never had a problem. I don’t really have sensitive skin, either. I can even handle mosquito bites pretty well! I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. No known allergies is very good. Now, Ms. Geho, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never have. My mother smoked for a while, but I always thought it was terrible. I can’t stand the smell of it, either. No, no smoking for me. I try to stay away from it whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy, just a small glass. Red wine, usually. I heard it’s good for your heart, too, in moderation, of course. I don't drink beer or hard liquor, though. Is that… okay? I don't want to be doing something I shouldn’t.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Geho. A moderate amount of red wine is generally considered acceptable, and some studies even suggest potential benefits. We define moderate as up to one drink per day for women. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I try to eat healthy. I have oatmeal for breakfast most mornings, and I pack a salad for lunch. Dinner varies. I like chicken and fish, and I try to eat lots of vegetables. I do enjoy potatoes, though, and I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I have dessert a couple of times a week. Chocolate, usually. I bake cookies sometimes for my grandchildren. It's hard to resist! I should probably eat more fruit, I guess. It’s a work in progress.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable diet, Ms. Geho. It’s great that you’re focusing on fruits and vegetables, and it’s perfectly fine to enjoy treats in moderation. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I don’t mind at all. I’m used to going to the doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Geho. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Your ears and throat look clear as well. I don’t see anything immediately alarming. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just a little pressure, that’s all. No pain or anything like that. Everything feels normal, I think. My stomach sometimes feels a little bloated, but I just thought it was something I ate. It usually goes away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No significant tenderness. That bloating could be related to diet, as you mentioned. Now, just to get a more complete picture, I’d like to order some blood work. It will include a complete lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, as well as a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a blood glucose test. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood work is no problem at all. Will you tell me when I need to fast before the test? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very good question. For an accurate lipid panel, you will need to fast for 9 to 12 hours before the test. That means no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. I’ll give you a lab requisition with specific instructions. The lab is located just down the hall, and you don’t need an appointment. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, are there any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting this checked out. So, just fast for 9 to 12 hours, and then go to the lab down the hall. Sounds easy enough. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. That’s what I’m here for. And yes, it’s fairly straightforward. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they are available, typically within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any work or school restrictions we should document in case you need a note?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’m retired! I used to be an aerospace engineer, but now I just volunteer at the local library and spend time with my grandchildren. No restrictions at all, thank you. Plenty of free time, unfortunately!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Geho. Enjoy your retirement and time with your grandchildren! Alright, then. I’ll give you the lab requisition and a summary of our discussion. Please contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you today. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too! It was nice meeting you as well. I’ll see you soon then. Goodbye!
