DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, good morning. It’s… well, it’s a little thing, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a card. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. You know, like you give to people who are really sick.
DOCTOR: Oh… I see. Well, that’s… unusual, but certainly not something I can’t look into. To be sure I understand, you're requesting a note from me, like a card offering encouragement?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A card. My… my niece, she’s been feeling down. Not sick sick, you understand. Just… low. And she always says my cards are the nicest. She says the doctor’s ones… they mean more. It's… important to her. And frankly, I don’t have much to say to her myself, these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a thoughtful gesture, Mr. Kammer. Before I proceed with that, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with your niece?
PATIENT: Well, she… she lost her job. A month ago, maybe. Something with the… the computers. She's always good with the computers, so it surprised everyone. She’s taking it hard, you see. Doesn’t want to leave the house. Mostly just sits around. It’s… it’s a shame. She was a bright girl. I just thought a nice card from the doctor… it might cheer her up.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like she's experiencing some distress after losing her job, and that's understandably difficult. Before I write the card, I just want to ask a few questions, if you don't mind. It’s just to get a better sense of the situation. Has she been experiencing any changes in her sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Well, my daughter tells me she's sleeping a lot. More than usual, anyway. And she doesn't eat much. Just picks at her food. She used to love to cook, but now… now she just doesn’t bother. I don't think she's seeing a doctor herself. She says she’s “fine,” but… you know how these young people are. They don’t like to complain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those changes do sound like they could be related to the stress she’s under. Has she mentioned feeling hopeless or having thoughts of harming herself?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no, nothing like that. She’s a good girl. Very sensible. She gets… quiet, you see. Just… withdrawn. My daughter checks on her every day, and she says she's not doing anything… bad. Just sad, mostly. I don’t want to make a big deal out of nothing, you understand. It's just… she’s always been so cheerful.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Mr. Kammer, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It's good that your daughter is checking on her. While it's reassuring that she's not expressing thoughts of self-harm, changes in mood, sleep, and appetite can sometimes be signs of something more serious, like depression. I'm happy to write a card with an encouraging message, and I will certainly do that for you. However, I also strongly recommend that your niece see a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. Would you be comfortable with me suggesting she schedule an appointment with a mental health specialist?
PATIENT: A mental health specialist… hmm. She wouldn’t like that. She’s very proud, you see. She wouldn’t want anyone to think she’s… weak. But… maybe. Maybe you could just write something in the card… something about talking to someone if she's feeling overwhelmed? Not a direct recommendation, you understand. Just… a gentle nudge. And yes, write whatever encouraging things you think best. Thank you, Doctor. You’re a good listener.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I can absolutely do that. I will write a card with an encouraging message, and I will include a gentle suggestion about reaching out for support if she's feeling overwhelmed, without directly recommending a specialist. Let me just take a moment to compose something suitable. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Just the card. Thank you again for listening. It’s… nice to talk to someone who understands. My daughter tries, but… well, it’s different. You’re a professional.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Kammer. I hope this card brings your niece some comfort. It wishes her well and encourages her to seek support if she’s struggling. Please remember, if her condition worsens or you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to bring her to see a healthcare professional. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: That's lovely, Doctor. Thank you very much. That's perfect. No, that’s all for today. Just the card. I appreciate your time, and your understanding. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. You have a good day as well. And please give my best to your niece. .
