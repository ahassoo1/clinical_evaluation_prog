DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. I received a rather insistent communication from your office regarding a… dietary review, shall we say? I’m afraid I’ve been experimenting with some rather… unconventional eating plans lately, and my daughter – bless her heart – felt a professional opinion was warranted. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, at my age.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Vantine. It's very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to get things checked out, and you're certainly not alone in trying different approaches to diet. No need to be embarrassed at all. We're here to help. Could you tell me a little more about these “unconventional eating plans”?
PATIENT: Well, where to begin? It started innocently enough, I suppose. A chap at the golf club was raving about the “Moon Diet.” Apparently, one only consumes foods that are, or are grown under, the full moon. Rather restrictive, as you might imagine, given the English climate. That didn’t last long. Then there was the “Colour Diet” – only eating foods of a specific colour each day. Red on Monday, orange on Tuesday… you get the idea. The most recent… well, I attempted a “Breatharian” regimen. A rather… ambitious undertaking, focusing solely on prana, or life energy. It didn’t end well, I assure you. I was remarkably weak, and my daughter practically carried me to the telephone to book this appointment.
DOCTOR: Goodness, Mr. Vantine, that is quite a range of diets. And I can certainly understand why your daughter was concerned, especially with the Breatharian approach. That can be quite dangerous. Let's focus on what's been happening recently, since you stopped the Breatharian diet. Can you describe what you've been eating in the last few days?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Well, after the… incident, my daughter insisted on a return to “normal” food, as she puts it. Which, for me, traditionally means a rather robust English breakfast – bacon, eggs, sausage, black pudding, the works. And a generous portion of biscuits with my tea throughout the day. She's been attempting to steer me towards more… sensible options. Salads, grilled fish, that sort of thing. But I confess, I've been indulging in rather a lot of comfort eating, shall we say? Trying to regain my strength, perhaps. Though I suspect it's more psychological than anything else. I had a particularly large slice of Victoria sponge yesterday, and a rather decadent chocolate éclair this morning.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to want comfort food after a challenging experience, Mr. Vantine. And it sounds like you've had quite a bit on your plate recently – no pun intended. Let's get a better picture of your overall health. Have you noticed any specific symptoms since you stopped the Breatharian diet, besides perhaps feeling weak?
PATIENT: Indeed. Weakness was the primary issue, of course. And a persistent feeling of… coldness, even when adequately clothed. My hands and feet were particularly affected. Digestion has been rather… unreliable, shall we say? Alternating between a lack of appetite and a rather urgent need for the facilities. And, if I’m being perfectly honest, my sleep has been rather disturbed. I wake up several times a night, feeling restless and… anxious. It’s nothing debilitating, mind you. But certainly not my usual robust self. I’ve also noticed a slight… tremor in my hands. Very slight, but noticeable when I’m attempting to enjoy a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That’s very helpful. The weakness, coldness, digestive issues, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and tremor are all things we need to explore further. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions about your health history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Not as such, Doctor. I’ve been remarkably fortunate, health-wise, throughout my life. A touch of arthritis in my knees, which is to be expected at my age, and a slightly elevated cholesterol level, which my general practitioner has been monitoring for some time. Nothing requiring medication, thankfully. I had a rather nasty bout of influenza a few years ago, but recovered fully. Otherwise, I’ve generally been quite robust. I’ve always been a fairly active chap, enjoyed a good walk, a round of golf… until recently, of course. My late wife, God rest her soul, always insisted on a healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like you’ve generally been very healthy, despite the arthritis and cholesterol. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing of the sort. I had my tonsils removed as a child, a rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And a minor operation to repair a torn meniscus in my knee some years ago, but it was a relatively straightforward procedure and I recovered quickly. Other than that, I’ve been remarkably fortunate, as I said. I’ve always prided myself on my constitution. Perhaps this recent experimentation has simply… thrown things off balance.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. A rather… complicated subject. My mother’s side, bless her, were prone to… melancholia, as they called it. A touch of depression, I suppose. Nothing severe, but a tendency towards introspection and… sadness. My father’s side were generally quite robust, though his brother did succumb to heart disease in his early sixties. And my paternal grandmother suffered from what the doctor described as “hardening of the arteries,” which I suspect is similar to my own elevated cholesterol. Nothing particularly alarming, mind you. My late wife’s family were remarkably healthy, if anything. They lived to a ripe old age, generally quite sprightly until the very end.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. So, some history of melancholia on your mother’s side, and heart disease and arterial issues on your father’s side. Now, let’s talk about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life, and only the occasional glass of sherry with dinner. A small glass, mind you. For medicinal purposes, of course. And recreational drugs? Good heavens, no. I’m a rather old-fashioned chap, you see. I prefer a good book and a quiet evening by the fire. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, as I’ve mentioned. Perhaps too much tea, if I’m being perfectly honest. My daughter frequently chides me about my caffeine intake.
DOCTOR: A glass of sherry and a cup of tea – perfectly reasonable. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I’ve never experienced any adverse reactions to any medication prescribed by my general practitioner. And as for food, I enjoy a rather varied diet, as you’ve gathered. Although I do find that certain cheeses… disagree with me slightly. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a touch of indigestion. And I confess, I’m not overly fond of Brussels sprouts. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine, thank you for providing me with such a comprehensive history. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Quite alright, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. I've never been particularly averse to a bit of poking and prodding. Though I do hope it won’t be too unpleasant. I'm rather a sensitive chap, you see.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Vantine. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Again… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for concern, but we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well: 145/90. Again, not drastically high, but something we need to monitor. I notice a slight tremor in your hands, as you mentioned. It’s quite subtle, but present. Let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished. Your feet feel quite cool to the touch, and your pulses are slightly weaker than I’d expect. Any pain or numbness in your feet?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor, not precisely. A rather… tingling sensation, occasionally. A coolness, as you’ve observed. It’s not debilitating, mind you, just… uncomfortable. I often find myself wearing thicker socks than necessary. And I confess, I’ve noticed a slight… pallor in my feet. A rather ghostly hue, my daughter remarked. She has a rather dramatic flair, you see. The tingling sensation comes and goes, really. It’s most noticeable in the evenings, after a long day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. That’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the examination – the elevated heart rate and blood pressure, the tremor, the diminished reflexes, the cool feet, and the tingling sensation – I’d like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. These will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels , kidney function, and a complete blood count. We'll also want to check your glucose levels, given the recent dietary changes. I’d also like to order an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm and rule out any underlying cardiac issues. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgement implicitly. ECG and blood tests… a bit of a nuisance, perhaps, but I understand the necessity. I've always been a firm believer in preventative medicine. And I confess, I'm rather eager to discover the cause of these… peculiarities. The thought of my heart being… irregular is somewhat unsettling, I must admit.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be anxious, Mr. Vantine, but try not to worry too much. These tests will simply give us more information, and we'll discuss the results thoroughly. I'm going to print out a lab requisition form for the blood tests and a referral for the ECG. The lab is just down the hall, and the ECG can be done at the imaging center across the street. They're expecting you. The lab will need a fasting blood sample, so please don’t eat or drink anything except water for at least eight hours before the test. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you try to maintain a balanced diet – focusing on lean protein, fruits, and vegetables – and avoid any extreme diets. Also, ensure you’re getting enough rest and managing any stress. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. Balanced diet, sufficient rest, stress management… sensible advice, indeed. I confess, I may have been somewhat… reckless in my recent dietary experimentation. I shall endeavor to follow your recommendations to the letter. Perhaps a simple roast chicken and a side of vegetables is the way forward. And a small glass of sherry, of course. For medicinal purposes. Thank you for your thorough examination and your… patience with my rather peculiar history. I appreciate it immensely. I shall proceed with the tests as directed. And I look forward to our follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It was my pleasure. And yes, a roast chicken and vegetables sounds like a perfectly sensible plan. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
