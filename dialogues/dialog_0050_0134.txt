DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s my stomach, mostly. Feels awful queasy a lot of the time, and I just don’t have much room for food these days. Even a little bit makes me feel full, you know? It's been going on for a little while now, but it seems worse lately. I apologize if I sound confused, dear. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Kelder. It's perfectly alright to take your time. Memory can be…selective, as we age. Queasiness and early satiety – feeling full quickly – are certainly concerning. "A little while now" is rather vague, however. Could you perhaps give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A timeframe…let me think. It feels like…maybe a couple of months? Or has it been longer? It's hard to say, honestly. It started gradually, just not feeling as hungry, then the sick feeling started happening after I ate. I do remember it being worse after my… after Harold passed. But that was…oh, it's been five years now, hasn't it? I truly am sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more precise. It all just blends together sometimes.
DOCTOR: Five years is…significant, Mrs. Kelder. While grief can certainly manifest physically, a persistent issue for that duration warrants investigation regardless. So, to clarify, the queasiness has been present for approximately five years, but has it worsened recently, say within the last month or two?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely worse recently. The last month or so, it's been…well, more frequent, and it lasts longer. It used to be just a little upset, you know? Now, it feels like I could throw up any minute, even if I haven't eaten anything. And I'm losing weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t really…I haven't been weighing myself regularly. I used to, but…well, things just haven’t been the same since Harold. I apologize, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: It is quite alright, Mrs. Kelder. You are not rambling. Weight loss in conjunction with persistent nausea and early satiety is…troubling. Let's move on to a more thorough questioning. Have you experienced any vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a few times. Not often, but enough to worry me. Usually it’s just…well, whatever I last ate, you know? It doesn’t come up easily, and it leaves me feeling very weak afterwards. It hasn’t been every day, thank goodness, but it's happening more frequently now, like maybe once a week or so. And it's just…not right, Doctor. The color isn’t right either. It’s…a bit yellowish, I think. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Yellowish emesis…that is a concerning development, Mrs. Kelder. We need to explore this further. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Bowel movements…let me think. They've been…well, paler, I guess. Not dark and solid like they used to be. And…less frequent, too. I used to go every day, regular as clockwork, but now it’s every other day, or sometimes even longer. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it's…difficult, sometimes. I’ve been taking those fiber supplements, but they don’t seem to be helping much. I apologize if I'm being too graphic, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are not being graphic at all, Mrs. Kelder. These details are essential. Pale stools and infrequent bowel movements, coupled with the nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, are…suggestive of a potential biliary obstruction. I need to perform a physical examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A…biliary obstruction? That sounds…frightening, Doctor. I don't know what that is, exactly, but it doesn't sound good. A physical examination…yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I just hope it's nothing too serious. I've had enough trouble lately, with…well, everything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Kelder. A biliary obstruction simply means something is blocking the flow of bile from your gallbladder, which aids in digestion. It can be caused by a variety of things, and we need to determine the cause. Please, if you would be so kind, lie down on the examination table. We'll start with palpation of your abdomen. I will be checking for tenderness or any masses. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Palpation…that sounds…well, a bit scary. But I trust you, Doctor. . Just let me know if I need to do anything. It's alright. I've had worse. Mostly just…missing Harold. Go ahead, please. And thank you for being so kind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kelder. I'm just going to press gently on your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh…yes. A little bit. Right there, under my ribs, on the right side. It's not a sharp pain, exactly, more of a…dull ache. It's been there for a little while, but it's worse when you press on it. Like a…heavy feeling. Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? I apologize. I’m probably just imagining things.
DOCTOR: It is not “imagining things”, Mrs. Kelder. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant, coupled with your other symptoms, is…concerning. I am listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are…hypoactive. Diminished. Now, I would like to check for jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes. Please look straight ahead. Yes…there is a definite yellowing of your sclera, and a subtle jaundice of the skin. This, combined with everything else… I am concerned about a potential obstructive jaundice, likely caused by a blockage in the biliary system. I need to order some blood work immediately, including a complete metabolic panel and liver function tests. And we will need to schedule an abdominal ultrasound as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…very serious, Doctor. An obstruction…and jaundice? My goodness. Blood work and an ultrasound…yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It’s just…a lot to take in. I truly am sorry to be such a bother. I just hope it’s not…not too bad. Is there…is there anything I can do? I just want to get this sorted out. And…what does this mean? Is it…cancer? My mother…she had cancer, a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kelder, it is alright to be worried. It is concerning, and I understand your anxiety, especially given your mother’s history. However, an obstructive jaundice has many potential causes, and cancer is only one of them. It could be a gallstone blocking the bile duct, inflammation, or another non-cancerous condition. We need to determine the cause before we can talk about prognosis or treatment. The blood work will give us information about your liver function and overall health. The ultrasound will allow us to visualize your gallbladder, bile ducts, and liver, and hopefully identify the blockage. I will order these tests immediately. In the meantime, I want you to refrain from eating anything. It will prepare you for potential further imaging. I will have a nurse come in to discuss the tests and schedule them for you. And please, do not hesitate to ask me any questions you have. We will get through this, together. I am also going to prescribe you medication for the nausea to provide some relief. Is there anyone you would like me to call for you?
PATIENT: Oh…thank you, Doctor. That…that does make me feel a little bit better. Knowing there are other possibilities. A little bit better. No, no one to call, thank you. My Harold…he’s gone. I'm…I'm alone. But…medication for the nausea would be wonderful. Thank you. I truly appreciate your kindness, Doctor. And…please, don’t hesitate to tell me what you think, even if it’s bad. I’d rather know. I just…I just want this to be over. And…thank you again. For everything. .
