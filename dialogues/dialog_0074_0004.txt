DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, just came in for my shots, like I usually do. Routine stuff, you know? Keeps me from gettin’ sick when everyone else is snifflin’.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Keeping up with vaccinations is excellent preventative care. I see from your chart you’ve been diligent with those, which is wonderful. Just to confirm, are you referring to your annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, or were you thinking of anything else today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, all those names… I just know I gotta get poked once a year, ha! I think it’s the flu one I’m mostly thinkin’ about right now. Pneumo… is that the one for my lungs? I always forget which one is which.
DOCTOR: No worries at all; it’s very common to mix those up! The pneumococcal vaccine is indeed for protection against pneumonia and other lung infections. It's generally recommended less frequently than the annual flu vaccine, especially for those with good health. Let’s focus on the flu vaccine today then. Have you had your flu vaccine yet this season—meaning since October of last year?
PATIENT: Hmm… October… let me think. I think I got it last year, but… honestly, I can't quite recall when exactly. It was probably around November, maybe? I usually try to get it before the holidays, but things get a little hectic then, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's best to be sure. Since you're unsure, we'll go ahead and administer the flu vaccine today to ensure you're protected for the upcoming season. Before we do that, just to be thorough, have you had any reactions to the flu vaccine in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little soreness in my arm afterwards, like with any shot, but nothin’ major. Never had a fever or felt sick from it. Just a little achy sometimes. It's always worth gettin' it though, even with a little soreness, right? Much better than gettin' the flu itself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A little soreness is a small price to pay for the protection it provides. And are you currently experiencing any symptoms of illness—fever, cough, sore throat, body aches—anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope, feelin’ pretty good actually. A little tired sometimes, bein' my age, ha! But nothin' a good night’s sleep can’t fix. No cough, no fever, nothin' like that. Just my usual self. I’m here before it gets too cold and everything starts goin’ around, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And just to be completely thorough, do you have any allergies to eggs or any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… eggs… No, not that I know of. I eat ‘em all the time. Fried, scrambled, in cakes… no problems at all. And I don’t take any regular medications, just a little ibuprofen for my arthritis now and then. Nothing fancy, though.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Ms. Fornes, it sounds like you’re a good candidate for the flu vaccine today. We’ll administer it in your left deltoid muscle. It’s a quick injection, and there may be some mild soreness afterwards, as you mentioned. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything. Sounds good to me. Just get it over with, ha! I’m a big girl, I can handle a little poke. Thanks for makin’ sure everything’s alright first though, I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It’s my job to make sure everything is as comfortable and safe as possible. This might feel like a little pinch… just a moment. All done. Here, let me put a bandage on that for you. There you go. Just keep that area clean and dry, and if you experience any unusual or severe side effects, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I'll also have the nurse give you a printed sheet with information on potential side effects and what to look out for.
PATIENT: That wasn't bad at all! Barely felt a thing, honestly. Thanks, Doctor. I always worry about gettin’ sick, especially with the grandkids visitin’. Gotta stay healthy for those little ones, you know? Alright, I guess that's all for today, huh?
DOCTOR: I completely understand; grandparents are essential! That's a wonderful reason to stay protected. And yes, it seems we've covered everything for today. I've documented the flu vaccine administration in your chart. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the information sheet and answer any further questions you may have. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind, Doctor Reisig. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so well. Tell your nurse I said thank you too! Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was my pleasure to care for you today. Staying healthy is a team effort, and I’m glad we could work together to ensure you’re protected for the flu season. I will certainly pass along your thanks to the nurse. You have a wonderful day as well, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if anything arises. .
