DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… for driving, you know, for the ride-share thing. Or taxi… or commercial driving, whatever it's called. I drive people around sometimes. It’s a bit of a hassle renewing it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Ah, I understand. You need a medical certificate for commercial driving – often called a Department of Transportation, or DOT, physical. It can be a bit of a process. Okay, I see here you're 70 years old, and your insurance is Medicare. Just to confirm, are you currently driving professionally, or are you planning to start?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Seventy. And Medicare is fine. I do drive. Not every day, but a few times a week. I pick up people from the airport mostly. Sometimes just around town if someone needs a ride. It’s just extra money, you know? I want to keep doing it as long as I can.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. To make sure you meet the requirements for a DOT physical, we’ll need to go through a fairly detailed check-up. First, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else significant?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Significant… Well, let me think. My blood pressure has been a little high sometimes, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a small pill for it. Just a little one, every morning. And… hmm. My knees bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. Arthritis, they said. Nothing major, though. I can still get around, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, high blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis in the knees. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s a white pill… small, round… Oh! I think it's Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, that’s it. The doctor said it would help keep things steady. I’ve been taking it for… oh, maybe five years now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, 5 years. Good. And how are you managing the arthritis in your knees?
PATIENT: Mostly just trying to stay active. I walk when I can, and I try not to overdo it. Sometimes I take ibuprofen when they really bother me, but not very often. The doctor said it was okay as long as I didn’t take too much. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s reasonable. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out a long, long time ago. Maybe thirty years ago? Everything went fine, no problems there. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist, a silly fall in the garden. But that was years ago too. Nothing since then, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist, both in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything… sometimes I should stop eating everything, ha! But no, no allergies to report. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning with my pill. And sometimes, if I'm feeling a bit tired, I'll take some Vitamin C. That's it, really. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril, occasional ibuprofen, a multivitamin, and Vitamin C. Thank you. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, look at your vision, and do a basic neurological exam – checking your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I’m not afraid of a little check-up. Just try not to take too long, alright? I have some errands to run later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Vision is 20/30 in both eyes, which is a bit diminished, but probably doesn’t require immediate correction for driving. Reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems good. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I’m just going to check your pulse in your feet. Pulses are a little weak, but present. It's good that we are checking these things. Now, just to be thorough, could you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… It’s a bit difficult, you know. The arthritis really flares up sometimes. I can't quite reach my toes anymore. But it doesn’t hurt terribly, just… stiff.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright, don't push yourself. Okay, that’s good to know. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, which is consistent with arthritis. Now, just one more thing. Could you please walk a few steps forward and backward for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Just a little unsteady, you know. I’m a bit wobbly sometimes. But I haven’t fallen yet!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your gait is a little slow and unsteady, but you are able to maintain your balance. Okay, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Based on this examination, we have a few things to consider. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, your vision is slightly diminished, and your gait is somewhat unsteady. These things could potentially affect your ability to drive safely. Do you have any concerns about your driving ability, or has anyone ever expressed concern to you?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my daughter sometimes tells me to slow down. She worries, you know? Says I don’t see things as quickly as I used to. But I’ve been driving for fifty years! I think I can still handle it. It's just… getting older, I suppose. It's hard to give up something you've done your whole life.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good that your daughter is looking out for you. Considering your slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished vision, and your daughter's concerns, I recommend getting a formal vision test from an ophthalmologist. That will give us a clearer picture of your visual acuity. Also, it might be a good idea to discuss your blood pressure with your primary care physician and ensure it's well-controlled. Based on these recommendations, I'm not able to sign off on your DOT physical at this time. However, once you've had the vision test and your blood pressure is stable, we can re-evaluate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. So, I can’t drive right now? That's… difficult. I rely on that income. A vision test… and the doctor… alright. I suppose I have no choice. But it will take time, you know? And I need to work. So, no driving until I get these things done? That's what you're saying?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. For safety reasons, and to comply with DOT regulations, I cannot sign off on your physical until we have those results. I understand this is inconvenient, and I apologize for that. Here’s a referral to a local ophthalmologist, Dr. Yamamoto. She’s very good. And this note explains the situation, which you can take to your primary care physician as well. In the meantime, perhaps we can discuss alternative ways to manage your income while you’re unable to drive. Would you like me to connect you with any social services that might be able to help?
PATIENT: Oh… that's kind of you. Social services… I don’t know… I've always managed on my own. I'm a bit… independent, you know? I don't like asking for help. But… thank you. I'll think about it. Maybe if things get really tight. So, I need to make an appointment with this Dr. Yamamoto, and see my regular doctor… then come back to you? That sounds like a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. You'll need to schedule appointments with Dr. Yamamoto and your primary care physician, and then once you have the results, schedule a follow-up appointment with me. I understand it's a lot of trouble, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. However, it's important to ensure your safety and the safety of others on the road. I can have my nurse call you in a few days to check if you’ve been able to schedule those appointments. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be very helpful. A phone call would be good. I sometimes forget things, you know. So, a reminder would be nice. Alright. I guess that’s all I can do for now. Thank you, Doctor. I'll try to get these appointments scheduled as soon as possible. I appreciate your help… even if it's a bit complicated. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry, we’ll do our best to make the process as smooth as possible. My nurse will be in touch soon. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions in the meantime. And drive safely until then. .
