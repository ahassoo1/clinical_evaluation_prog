DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: It is good to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone about it. I’m not entirely sure what I’m supposed to do about it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Chellsea. That’s a big thing to process, and it’s okay to feel unsure. Okay, so you were recently told about a cancer diagnosis. Can you tell me a little bit about what was found, and who told you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. It was Doctor…Doctor Ramirez, at the hospital. He showed me some pictures…on the computer. It's in my…my chest. He said it was a type of…a type of tumor. I don’t really remember the name. He said I needed to see someone for…for a plan. Is that okay? I don’t mean to be…difficult.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Chellsea, please don’t worry about that. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and forget details when you’re given a lot of information. Okay, so Dr. Ramirez showed you images and mentioned a tumor in your chest. Do you remember anything about the size of the tumor, or where exactly in your chest it was located?
PATIENT: Hmm…size…I think he said it was…small. Not very big, but growing. He pointed to it on the screen…it was near my…my heart, I think? Or maybe a little bit to the side of it. It’s all a bit blurry, honestly. I was…very upset when he told me. It was a shock. I apologize for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Chellsea. It’s understandable that it’s blurry, especially with the emotional stress. Let me pull up your records from the hospital. Hopefully, we can get some more specifics there. Okay, I see here it was a lesion detected on a chest X-ray. The report says “approximately 2 cm in diameter” and located in the mediastinum – that’s the space in your chest between your lungs, and it does sit near your heart. It’s being classified as a mediastinal mass. Have you had any symptoms associated with this mass – like chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Two centimeters…mediastinum… Symptoms… Well, I have been feeling a little more tired lately. But I thought that was just…life. And a little bit of a cough, but that comes and goes. Nothing too bad. I haven’t had any chest pain, no. And I can breathe okay, I think. I haven’t really pushed myself to do much…since…well, since my husband passed. I’m sorry. Is that…helpful?
DOCTOR: It is very helpful, Chellsea, thank you for sharing that. And I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. That’s a huge loss, and it absolutely explains why you haven’t been pushing yourself. The tiredness and cough could be related to the mass, or they could be something else entirely. It’s important to investigate. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I don’t have much of a medical history, to be honest. I've always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses…chickenpox, measles…but nothing serious. I haven't had any surgeries or anything like that. And I don’t take any regular medications. My husband…he was the one who always got sick. He had…diabetes. And heart problems. I took care of him for a long time. That’s why I’m a occupational therapist, actually. I wanted to help other people. Is that…enough?
DOCTOR: That is enough, Chellsea. And thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’ve been a very dedicated caregiver, and that’s admirable. So, no significant medical history, no surgeries, no medications. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I think. And her mother…my grandmother…she had arthritis, really bad arthritis. She was in a wheelchair for a long time. That’s about all I can remember, honestly. My father’s side…I didn’t know my father very well. He left when I was young. I don’t know anything about their medical history. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Chellsea. It's common for family medical histories to be incomplete. Okay, so some history of high blood pressure and arthritis on your mother’s side. And let's quickly cover allergies – do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions, that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a reaction to any medicine. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Although, luck hasn’t felt very strong lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to get a full picture, and this might seem a bit personal, but could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Like…what I do for fun? I haven't been doing much fun lately, if that’s what you mean. I used to like to go hiking…before…everything. And I like to read. But mostly I just…stay home. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. When I ask about social history, I also mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. It helps me understand your overall health. And, I also want to know about your occupation - you mentioned being an occupational therapist, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, occupational therapist. I work at the community clinic, mostly with people recovering from strokes and injuries. It’s… rewarding work. And no, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Never really liked it. And definitely no drugs. I’m a very healthy person, Doctor. Or… I was. I just…I don’t understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel that way, Chellsea. It’s frustrating when something like this happens to someone who takes good care of themselves. Okay, so no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. And you’re working as an occupational therapist. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you want to tell me, or any questions you have for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I’m just… scared. I don’t know what this means. What happens next? Is it… is it serious? And…will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It's okay to be scared, Chellsea. Those are very valid questions, and it’s good that you’re asking them. Let's talk about what happens next. We need to get some more information to understand what we're dealing with. The first step is a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel for any enlarged lymph nodes. We’ll also need to order some further imaging – likely a CT scan of your chest to get a clearer picture of the mass and see if it’s spread anywhere. Depending on the results of the CT scan, we may need to consider a biopsy to determine exactly what type of cells are present. As for whether it’s serious... it’s too early to say. There are many different types of mediastinal masses, some of which are benign, and some of which are malignant. We need more information before we can determine that. And as for whether it will hurt… that depends on the procedures we need to do, and what we find. We'll do everything we can to manage any pain or discomfort. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a biopsy… Will the biopsy hurt a lot? And… what if it is serious? What are the… what are the options? I’m sorry. I’m just… overwhelmed. I don't know what any of this means. .
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be overwhelmed, Chellsea. It's a lot to take in, and you’re doing a good job just by being here and asking questions. Regarding the biopsy, there are different types of biopsies. The one we would likely consider is a needle biopsy, where we use a thin needle to take a small sample of tissue. It usually causes some mild discomfort, like a pinch or pressure, and we can provide local anesthesia to minimize that. There’s also a risk of bleeding or infection, but those are rare. As for what options there are if it is serious… that depends on the type of mass and how far it has spread. Options can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of those. We would discuss all of those options with you in detail, and create a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs. We are not at the point where we need to make any decisions about treatment yet. Right now, our priority is to get a better understanding of what we're dealing with. Would you like me to start with the physical exam?
