DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about a letter. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for a trip, and they need it from a doctor. It’s a bit of a long story, honestly.
DOCTOR: A letter for flying…right. And this is…because of a medical condition, or simply a formality for the airline?
PATIENT: Not a condition, exactly. My husband… he passed away a few months ago. We had tickets booked, a trip planned. The airline is being…difficult about transferring the ticket to someone else, and they said a doctor’s note saying I’m fit to travel would help. It’s mostly to prove I’m of sound mind to make the change, I think. They're worried about fraud, something like that. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's not a medical issue preventing travel, but a request to allow travel under… unusual circumstances. Hmm. Well, I suppose I can document your fitness for travel, but it’s…not a standard medical request, Ms. Sayar. To be thorough, I will need to ask a few questions to ensure you are indeed fit for travel. It's just procedure. Have you been experiencing any significant stress, anxiety, or changes in your sleep or appetite since your husband's passing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, procedure. I understand. And…well, yes. Significant stress is…an understatement. Sleep is…patchy. Some nights are okay, some are not. And my appetite…it comes and goes. I lost a bit of weight initially, but I’m trying to eat regularly now. It’s…difficult to motivate myself sometimes, if I’m being honest. But I’m functioning. I’m still working, still…keeping things together. It just takes more effort, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Functioning" is good. We need to assess if this stress is impacting your ability to make sound decisions, which is what the airline is concerned about, it seems. Have you noticed any difficulties with concentration, memory, or confusion lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. Actually, I have a very good memory. I remember details easily, even small things. That hasn’t changed. Concentration… sometimes my mind wanders, but that was true even before. I wouldn’t say it’s worse. And no confusion, not at all. I’m very clear-headed. It's more…emotional exhaustion, if anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Emotional exhaustion…yes, that’s a very common response to loss. Alright. Just to be comprehensive, Ms. Sayar, have you been taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements, to help manage your stress or sleep?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I really try to avoid medication if I can. I’ve been trying… mindfulness exercises, mostly. And just trying to keep busy, distract myself. I haven’t found anything that works consistently, but I haven’t resorted to pills, no. I’m a little wary of side effects, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m noting that you’re not currently on any medication. Now, just a quick physical assessment, to ensure there are no underlying issues contributing to your stress. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Routine, really, but we must cover all bases. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That’s fine. Routine is good. I wouldn’t want them to think I wasn’t thorough. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me…and exhale slowly. Again…good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/76. Pulse is 72. Within normal limits. Do you have any history of heart problems or high blood pressure that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, none at all. My family is… generally healthy. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, and everything has always been good. I had a bout of the flu last year, but that was it. Nothing serious. Is this all taking long? I do have a meeting later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, we're almost finished, Ms. Sayar. Just a few more questions. This is all necessary to provide a comprehensive note for the airline. Now, have you experienced any recent changes in your vision, headaches, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Vision is fine, no headaches, and I haven’t felt dizzy at all. Honestly, I feel… physically okay. It’s just…the emotional part is exhausting. I’m functioning, I’m capable, but it takes effort. I’m really just trying to get this letter so I can sort out the tickets and…move on, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. Based on my assessment and your statements, you appear to be physically fit for travel. Your vital signs are within normal limits, and you haven’t reported any significant medical concerns that would preclude travel. However, I must document your recent loss and acknowledge the emotional stress you’re experiencing. I will write a note stating you are capable of making sound decisions regarding your travel plans and that you are of sound mind. It will also mention the recent bereavement and acknowledge the emotional distress. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Exactly what I need. Thank you, Doctor. That would be… a huge relief. Will it be ready today? I need to send it to the airline as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Sayar. I’ve included a statement acknowledging your bereavement and the associated emotional stress, as we discussed. It also states my professional opinion that you are fit to make decisions regarding your travel arrangements. Please review it to ensure it meets your needs. I'm also including a recommendation that you consider grief counseling to support you through this difficult time. It is a challenging process, and professional support can be very beneficial. Do you have any questions about the note, or anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Yes, this is… perfect, thank you so much. It says everything I needed it to say. And thank you for the recommendation about grief counseling. I…I appreciate that. I’ve been thinking about it, actually. No, I think that’s all. Thank you for your time, Doctor Nestingen. I really appreciate you fitting me in. .
