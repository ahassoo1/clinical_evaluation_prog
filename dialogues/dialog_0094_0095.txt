DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s…my hearing. Or, rather, the lack of it in one ear. And my face feels…off. Droopy, maybe? It started yesterday morning, I think. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Inconvenient is certainly a way to put it, and we'll try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. So, yesterday morning you noticed both hearing loss in one ear and some drooping on one side of your face?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Left side. Though, honestly, I haven't spent that much time staring at myself in the mirror. I have more important things to do than worry about…cosmetics. It just feels…weak. And the hearing is just gone. No ringing, no pain, just…nothing. It's the left ear, definitely the left. I remember because I couldn't hear the news properly when I was having my tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so left ear hearing loss and facial weakness, also on the left side, that began yesterday morning. You haven't experienced any pain or ringing in the ear, just a sudden loss of hearing. And it affected your ability to hear the news while having tea – that’s a helpful detail. To get a better understanding, could you describe the facial weakness a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s…hard to explain. It just doesn't feel normal. Like, when I smile, the left side doesn't go up as much. And when I try to close my eye tightly, it doesn't shut all the way. It's subtle, really, but I notice it. I haven’t exactly been practicing making faces in front of a mirror, you understand. I have a reputation to maintain. It’s not… obvious, but it’s there. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I really need to get back to my schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere. It sounds like the weakness is affecting your ability to fully close your left eye and the left side of your face doesn’t elevate as much when you smile. That’s very important information. Given the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, I'm concerned about something called Bell's palsy. It's a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll involve looking in your ears, testing your facial muscle strength, and a few other simple checks. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Bell’s…palsy? Is that…serious? I haven’t time for illnesses. And examinations. Honestly, I'd rather just have a diagnosis and a quick fix. But…fine. Do what you have to do. Quickly, please. I have a conference call at 2:00. And please, don't touch my hair. It’s quite delicate.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and I’ll be as efficient as possible. And absolutely, I won’t touch your hair. Bell’s palsy is often temporary, and many people recover fully, though sometimes there is some residual weakness. It's caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, and we often treat it with steroids to reduce the swelling. However, we need to rule out other causes of facial weakness first, like a stroke or a tumor. That’s why the exam is important. Alright, let’s start by taking a look in your ears. Could you please tilt your head to the right?
PATIENT: Fine. But if you find anything unpleasant in there, please don’t mention it. I have a low tolerance for…details. And be gentle. Honestly, I’ve always suspected doctors enjoy poking around unnecessarily. Tilt…is it much further? It feels rather awkward.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking in your left ear… I don't see any obvious signs of infection or blockage. The ear canal appears clear. And no visible masses or foreign objects. Now, if you could close your eyes tightly for me, please. Just squeeze them shut. I’m going to check how well your eyelids close.
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? It's a little difficult, to be honest. I've always had rather sensitive eyes. And frankly, this whole process is rather undignified. Are you seeing something wrong? Just tell me what it is. Don't make me perform some sort of facial gymnastics.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I'm noting some weakness on the left side of your face. When you smile, the left corner of your mouth doesn't lift as high as the right. Your left eyelid doesn’t close completely, and there’s a slight droop to the left side of your face. When I ask you to puff out your cheeks, the left side doesn’t inflate as fully as the right. Based on what you’ve described and what I’m seeing on the exam, Bell’s palsy is the most likely diagnosis at this point. However, to be absolutely sure, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any other potential causes. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. All this…investigation for something that feels like a slightly lopsided smile? Look, I haven't got time for machines and scans. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just…give me something for it? Some sort of injection, perhaps? I'd rather not spend hours lying in a tube if it's just going to confirm what you already suspect. And what about my schedule?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. You’re right, an MRI isn't ideal and I apologize for the inconvenience. However, while Bell’s palsy is the most probable cause given your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s crucial to rule out other, more serious conditions that can mimic Bell’s palsy, such as a stroke, tumor, or infection. An MRI is the best way to do that. Think of it as a precaution. It provides us with a definitive answer, allowing us to start the correct treatment plan immediately. As for treatment, the standard approach for Bell’s palsy is a course of oral corticosteroids, ideally started within 72 hours of symptom onset, which we are within. We can also prescribe eye drops to keep your eye moist and prevent corneal damage, as your inability to fully close your eye leaves it vulnerable. Would you be willing to proceed with the MRI?
PATIENT: Fine. But you are going to have to work very quickly. I have a conference call, as I've mentioned repeatedly, and I simply do not have time to spend all day in a hospital. And please, make sure it’s a comfortable machine. I've heard horror stories. And can you guarantee that it won't…mess up my hair? This is quite important. And when will I get the results? I need a definite timeline. Don't tell me 'a few days'. I need specifics.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. We'll get this scheduled as quickly as possible. I’ll have the scheduling department contact you immediately to arrange the MRI at the closest imaging center. I’ll request they prioritize your appointment given your time constraints. I will specifically request a comfortable machine and will inform the technicians of your concerns about your hair. They are generally very accommodating. The MRI typically takes about 30-45 minutes, and the radiologist usually provides the results within 24-48 hours. I will personally review them as soon as they are available and contact you immediately with the findings. I anticipate having them to you by tomorrow afternoon, at the latest. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a 7-day course of Prednisone, a corticosteroid, and artificial tears to protect your eye. I'll also provide you with some written instructions on how to care for your eye and what symptoms to watch out for. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I rarely take anything. I prefer to let my body handle things naturally. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to some sort of insect bite in Nigeria a few years ago… but that was Nigeria. Everything is different there. It could have been anything. No, I don’t have any known allergies to medications. Just…get on with it, please. I'm losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the prescriptions for the Prednisone and artificial tears, and this handout provides detailed information about Bell’s palsy, eye care, and potential side effects of the medication. Please read it carefully. The instructions advise you to start the Prednisone as soon as possible, and to use the artificial tears every hour while you’re awake to keep your eye moist. It’s important to monitor for any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased facial weakness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, or any changes in your vision. If you experience any of these, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll be in touch as soon as the MRI results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. Just…don't make me come back. I truly hope this Prednisone works. And please, make sure the scheduling department understands the urgency of this. I have a reputation to maintain, you understand. I don't have time for…complications. Right. I think that's all. I'll be going now. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Stephane. We will do everything we can to ensure a smooth and timely process. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Wishing you a speedy recovery, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. .
