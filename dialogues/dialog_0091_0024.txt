DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s a bit of a strange request, actually. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it before they’ll cover my trip.
DOCTOR: I understand. A letter of medical fitness to fly. Certainly, we can address that. To properly complete this for you, I'll need to gather some information. It's important to ensure your travel is safe and that I can responsibly provide that documentation. First, could you tell me a little bit about the trip itself?
PATIENT: Of course. It’s to visit my sister in Mongolia. She...she hasn’t been well. It’s a long flight – about fourteen hours, with a layover in Seoul. I’m flying on August 15th. I haven’t been on a plane in…oh, almost five years now.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. A fourteen-hour flight is significant, and the fact that it's been some time since your last flight is also relevant. To get a clearer picture, could you please describe your current health status?
PATIENT: Well, physically I’m okay, I think. I’m fairly active – I walk a lot, and I do some gardening. I’m about 176 centimeters tall and weigh around 60 kilograms. I had a bout of the flu last winter, but recovered fully. My biggest concern, honestly, is…well, my husband passed away two years ago. It’s been…difficult. I’m on Medicare, if that’s relevant. I don’t really have any major health problems, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Sayar. I understand that loss can be profoundly impactful, and I appreciate you being open about that. It's certainly relevant as we assess your overall well-being. And yes, knowing you're covered by Medicare is helpful for accessing your records. To ensure I have a complete picture, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, as well as any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: No medications currently, Doctor. Never have been a big pill-taker. And no allergies, thankfully. Not to food, not to anything. I really have been quite healthy, all things considered. It's just…sitting on a plane for so long feels a bit daunting, I suppose. And the insurance company is making it sound like I need a full medical workup just to get a letter.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know regarding medications and allergies. It’s certainly understandable to feel apprehensive about a long flight, particularly given your recent history. It sounds like the insurance company may be erring on the side of caution, which, while sometimes frustrating, isn't entirely unreasonable. To proceed, let's briefly review your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, lung problems, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox, measles, things like that, but I haven’t been seriously sick since I was a little girl. My husband, he…he had some heart trouble towards the end, but that was his health, not mine. I've always been very lucky, health-wise. I’ve never even been to the hospital except for a broken arm when I was eight. Really!
DOCTOR: That's very reassuring to hear, Ms. Sayar. It sounds as though you have a remarkably clean medical history. Given that, a full, extensive workup may not be necessary. However, to be thorough, and to responsibly complete the letter for your insurance company, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, focusing on your cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I just want to get the letter and be able to go see my sister. Anything to make that happen, really. A quick check-up is fine. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s proceed then. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and briefly examine your extremities. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, we'll check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. Here.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg. That’s within a normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m listening to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. In…and out…very good. Your lungs sound clear and open; I don’t detect any wheezing, crackles, or other abnormal sounds. I’m also listening to your heart now. Again, everything sounds regular and strong. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs detected. Your cardiovascular and respiratory systems appear to be in good condition. I'm noting all of this in your chart. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, not at all. My feet are fine. I walk a lot, like I said, and I haven't noticed any swelling. I do try to stay active. Everything feels…normal, honestly. It’s just the thought of being stuck on a plane for so long.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, and my exam confirms that. Given your negative medical history, the results of this brief exam, and your stated level of activity, I do not see any medical contraindications to air travel. I can confidently write a letter stating that you are medically fit to fly to Mongolia on August 15th, and that, to the best of my knowledge, you do not have any health conditions that would be exacerbated by air travel. I’ll include a recommendation to stay well-hydrated during the flight, and to move around periodically to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Does that sound satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds absolutely perfect! Thank you so much. Staying hydrated and moving around, that’s good advice. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and do the check-up. It’s a big weight off my shoulders. When can I expect the letter?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help alleviate your concerns. My nurse will print the letter for you before you leave. It should be ready within a few minutes. Just as a precaution, and for your peace of mind, I would also recommend reviewing the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis – things like pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in your calf. While the risk is low, it's always good to be informed. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything so well. I really appreciate it. Thank you again. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I wish you safe travels and hope you have a wonderful visit with your sister. If anything changes or you have any concerns before your trip, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, Ms. Sayar.
