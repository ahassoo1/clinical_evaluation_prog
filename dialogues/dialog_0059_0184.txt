DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Chagaris, you say? Hmm. Look, I ain't got all day. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I was too skinny. Always. And now... well, I just want to do something about it. I’m a pile driver operator, you know. Need some muscle. Not this... this frame. So, can you fix it or not?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand. You're concerned about your weight and would like to discuss options for gaining muscle mass, given your profession as a pile driver operator. We can definitely explore that. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a bit more about how long you’ve been feeling this way, and if you've noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes you talkin' 'bout? I eat when I eat. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Depends if the jerk chicken is good, mostly. And energy… I operate a pile driver! What you expect? Tired, sometimes. But that's just... life. I been skinny my whole life, really. Wife always bringin' it up. Been... a year since she passed. Maybe a little more. Look, I don’t do feelings, alright? Just tell me if you can put some meat on these bones.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You've been concerned about your weight for a long time, and it sounds like the loss of your wife has perhaps made it more noticeable. It’s alright to not want to dwell on feelings; we can focus on the practical aspects of addressing your concerns. To help me determine the best course of action, could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: A typical day? Hmph. Breakfast, sometimes. Ackee and saltfish if I'm feelin' it. Otherwise, a little fruit. Lunch… usually something from the cookshop near the yard. Rice and beans, chicken, maybe some fish. Dinner… same kinda thing. Whatever my daughter cooks, mostly. She tries. Not my wife’s cookin', of course. And I drink a Red Stripe now and then, if you must know. It helps with the... the aches. Is that what you want to know? What I eat? It ain’t fancy. I work hard. I eat. Simple.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. That gives me a good starting point. So, generally a diet centered around rice, beans, chicken or fish, with some fruit, and occasional Red Stripe. That’s helpful. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss in the past year, aside from simply wanting to gain weight?
PATIENT: Unintentional? No. I ain't tryin' to lose weight! I been steady, maybe a pound or two here or there. But nothin' drastic. I'm just… small. Always been small for a pile driver man. My coworkers, they’re big fellas. Look like they could lift the whole yard. I can do the job, don't get me wrong. But it takes… more effort. And now that I'm gettin' older… well, let's just say it's harder. Is that makin' any sense? You’re a doctor, you tell me if it makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Trendler. You've maintained a relatively stable weight, but you're concerned about having sufficient strength and energy for your demanding job, especially as you get older. It’s completely understandable. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmph. Old age, mostly. A little arthritis in the knees, the doctor said. Nothing major. Took some pills for it for a while, but they made me drowsy, so I stopped. And the blood pressure, sometimes a little high. But I try to take it easy when I can. That's about it. I ain’t one for doctors, you know? Never been a sickly man. Mostly just aches and pains. Normal stuff for a man my age. You writin' all this down? Hope you ain't gonna give me a list of things to worry about.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am making notes, Mr. Trendler. It’s important to have a complete picture. So, you have a history of arthritis in your knees and occasional high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. You stopped taking medication for the arthritis due to drowsiness, and you manage your blood pressure by taking it easy when possible. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had a surgery in my life. I’m a strong man! Pile driver work builds you tough. Hospitalized… once. When my daughter was born. Stayed overnight, that was all. Wife wanted me there. Good wife, she was. And that was… a long time ago. Before the aches and pains, before everything. Look, I’m tellin’ you all this, but what's it gonna do? Are you gonna give me some pills? 'Cause I don't want no pills. I just want to be stronger. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you've lived a very active life and prioritize staying strong and independent. You haven’t had any surgeries or hospitalizations aside from your daughter’s birth. Before we discuss options, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had… the sugar, they called it. Diabetes, I think. Died young. And my father, he had… heart trouble. Always complainin' 'bout his chest. Didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. That’s about it, really. Nobody else lived long enough to get any fancy diseases. They all worked hard, died tired. That’s the Trendler way. Is that what you need to know? Fancy diseases? I got aches and pains. That’s my disease. Now can we get to the strength part? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. That's very helpful. So, a family history of diabetes and heart disease. I understand your concern given your demanding job. Now, before we discuss options for increasing your strength, I’d like to ask about any allergies you have, and if you’re currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I eat everything. Jerk chicken, ackee and saltfish, you name it. Never been allergic to nothin'. And like I said, I don’t take pills. Stopped takin’ them years ago. Made me feel sluggish. Don't need sluggish when you’re swingin’ a pile driver. Just some liniment for the knees sometimes, when they're really achin’. But that ain’t a medication, that’s just… rubbin’ stuff. Look, I told you, I don’t do pills. Is there anything else you need to know? 'Cause I really gotta go. This is takin’ too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. No allergies and no medications, except for occasional liniment for your knees. I understand your frustration and desire to get back to work. Based on what you’ve told me, you’re a 76-year-old male with a history of arthritis, occasional high blood pressure, a family history of diabetes and heart disease, and you're concerned about maintaining your strength for your physically demanding job. Now, let’s talk about what we can do. Given your aversion to medication, I think the best approach would be to focus on optimizing your diet and exploring some gentle strength-training exercises. Would you be open to discussing that?
PATIENT: Strength-trainin’? Gentle? I swing a ten-pound hammer all day! That's strength trainin’! Look, I need somethin’ more. Somethin’ to give me more strength, not gentle stuff. I ain’t lookin’ for a spa day, I’m lookin’ for a way to lift heavier, longer. Diet? I eat. What kinda diet are you talkin' about? Less jerk chicken? Now you’re just tryin’ to ruin my life. Look, if you can’t give me somethin’ real, somethin’ that’ll actually make a difference, then I’m gonna go find another doctor. I’m wastin’ my time here. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I apologize if I’ve given the impression that I'm suggesting a gentle approach to replace your existing hard work. That’s certainly not what I meant. You are right to point out that swinging a ten-pound hammer all day is significant strength training. However, as we age, our bodies change, and we sometimes need to supplement our existing routines to maintain optimal function. Before we proceed, I want to be transparent. Given your concerns about medication, and the limited options available without it, I recommend a consultation with a specialist in sports medicine or physical therapy. They would be better equipped to assess your current strength and endurance, and develop a personalized exercise plan tailored to your specific needs and limitations. They can also advise you on nutritional strategies to support muscle growth and recovery. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A referral? To another doctor? You mean I gotta come here and talk to one doctor, then go there and talk to another doctor? This is ridiculous! Look, I came here for a quick fix. I wanted somethin' to make me stronger, not a whole lotta talk and runnin' around. I ain't got time for this! You know what? Forget it. I'm gonna go home and eat some jerk chicken. It's the only thing that's workin' for me right now. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I apologize that I haven't been able to provide the quick fix you were hoping for. It's important to me that you receive the best possible care, and in this case, I believe a specialist would be better equipped to meet your needs. I wish you all the best, and I encourage you to reconsider a referral when you have the time. . Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you change your mind. .
