DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s quite concerning. I don’t… I don’t recall exactly when it started, only that it's been a growing worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady… I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “Growing worry” is a good way to put it – we want to figure out what’s going on. When you say unsteady, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a constant thing, you see. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal, and then, without warning, it feels like the ground is… shifting. Not visually, of course. It’s more… internal. Like my balance is off. I’ve nearly stumbled a few times, but thankfully haven’t fallen yet. It's difficult to explain precisely. It's not dizziness, exactly, more like… a weakness in my legs, perhaps? Though I don’t feel weak, if that makes any sense. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Lilyanna. It's helpful to hear how you describe it, even if it's hard to put into words. “Shifting” and “balance off” are good clues. And it’s important that it’s not dizziness. Okay, so it comes and goes, no spinning sensation… Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s a very good question, Doctor. I… I truly wish I could say. I’ve been trying to pay attention, to identify a pattern, but I haven’t been successful. It seems to happen randomly. I work on a rig, you see – rotary drill operator – and it’s a rather demanding job. Perhaps fatigue plays a role? Though I’m usually quite careful to get enough rest. I… I lost my husband a few years back, and I’ve learned the importance of self-care. But no, I can’t pinpoint anything specific that brings it on. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, a demanding job, and you're mindful of rest, that's good to know. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone is incredibly difficult. Let’s talk a little more about the episodes themselves. When it happens, does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it was some time ago, but I appreciate your kindness. As for what makes it better… usually, if I can sit down and focus for a moment, it subsides. Just… stopping what I’m doing and concentrating on my breathing. It doesn’t happen instantly, but it does seem to help. Standing still and taking deep breaths… that seems to be the most effective thing. And… sometimes, if I can lean against something, that provides some reassurance. It’s rather unsettling, you see, the feeling of losing one’s balance. It passes, thankfully, but it’s still quite frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting, concentrating on breathing, leaning for support… that gives me some information to work with. Now, let's go through some routine questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: That’s quite alright, Doctor. I’m happy to provide any information that might be helpful. Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I haven’t experienced any headaches, or vision changes. No numbness or tingling in my limbs. My speech feels normal, I believe. I haven’t had any difficulties with swallowing. And… I don't think I've had any changes in my bladder or bowel habits. It’s…difficult to recall everything precisely, I’m afraid. It's not a clear memory, if that makes sense. I feel… generally well, aside from this disconcerting unsteadiness.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal not to have a perfect recall. The fact that you haven’t experienced those other symptoms is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Medical history… Let me see. I believe I had a rather standard childhood illness, measles, perhaps? Nothing serious. I was vaccinated, of course. And… I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but it cleared up with antibiotics. I’ve always been generally healthy, thankfully. My husband… he had some issues with his heart, but that’s… unrelated to my own health. I don’t recall any other significant medical conditions. I’ve had the usual check-ups with a general practitioner, of course, but nothing of note was ever discovered. I have private insurance, so I've always had access to care.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful. No major medical history. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, Doctor, I haven’t had any surgeries. Not ever. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. Just… routine dental work, if that counts. But no major operations or anything of that nature. I’ve always been rather careful to avoid any unnecessary risks. And… I haven’t been injured seriously, thankfully. Just the usual scrapes and bruises, nothing that required a hospital visit. I do hope that’s helpful. I am a bit flustered, if I’m being honest. It's hard to recall details sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Lilyanna. No surgeries is good to know. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a bit difficult, Doctor. My mother… she had some issues with her blood pressure, later in life. I believe she was on medication for it. And my father… he had arthritis, in his knees. It made it difficult for him to walk, towards the end. Aside from that… I don’t recall any other significant medical conditions in my family. My husband’s family… I wasn’t very close to them, so I don’t have much information about their medical history. I apologize for being so vague. It’s… difficult to remember everything precisely, especially when it comes to family matters. It's been some time since I've thought about it, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, arthritis in your father. That’s helpful. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always believed in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It’s important, you see, especially considering the demands of my job. I need to be alert and focused at all times. And… after losing my husband, I made a conscious effort to prioritize my health and well-being. It’s… important to me. I do hope that’s helpful. It’s a rather straightforward answer, I’m afraid. But I’m happy to provide any other information that might be useful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not currently taking any medications. Not even over-the-counter drugs or supplements. I’ve always preferred to address any minor ailments with natural remedies, if possible. And… I haven’t had any need for prescription medications, thankfully. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. And… I stopped taking it a few weeks ago, actually. I wanted to ensure that it wasn’t contributing to this unsteadiness in any way. I’ve always been rather careful about what I put into my body. It’s… important to me, as I mentioned before. I do hope that’s helpful. I apologize for being so repetitive, but I want to ensure that you have all the necessary information.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay. Just a basic neurological exam to check your balance, coordination, and reflexes. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I want to understand what is causing this unsteadiness, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way that I can. I’m a bit nervous, admittedly, but I’m confident that you’ll do your best to help me. I just want to… feel normal again. I do hope you’ll explain everything to me clearly, if you discover anything concerning. I do apologize for being so… anxious. It's just a bit frightening, not knowing what's happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilyanna. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly. Okay, walk towards that wall, then turn and come back. I’m observing your steps and how steady you are. Okay, good. Now, let's try a heel-to-toe walk – one foot directly in front of the other, like you're walking on a tightrope.
PATIENT: Oh… this is… a bit difficult, Doctor. I feel rather unsteady. I’m trying to keep my balance, but it’s… challenging. I’m concentrating very hard, but I can feel myself wobbling. I feel a bit… precarious, as I mentioned before. I hope I’m not making a mess of things. It feels… unnatural, walking like this. I’m afraid I’m not very graceful. I’m doing my best, but I feel… insecure. I hope I can complete the walk without falling. It feels… vulnerable, walking like this. I'm a bit breathless now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that’s alright. Stop there. No need to push it. I can see you're having some difficulty maintaining your balance, and that’s what we wanted to check. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap on your knees with this little hammer. Just relax.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Relax… I’ll try to relax. It’s… a bit unnerving, having my reflexes tested. I’ve always been a bit sensitive, so I hope it won’t be too unpleasant. I’ll try to remain still, and I’ll try to breathe deeply. I’m a bit apprehensive, truthfully, but I trust your judgment entirely. I’m doing my best to cooperate, but I’m afraid I’m a bit… tense. I hope you’ll explain everything to me clearly, if you discover anything concerning. I’m a bit… vulnerable, having my reflexes tested. I’m doing my best to remain calm, but it’s… difficult. I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. I hope it won’t be too unpleasant. I’m a bit… apprehensive, as I mentioned before. I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. I’m a bit… anxious, as I mentioned before. I hope you’ll explain everything to me clearly, if you discover anything concerning.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Lilyanna. We'll take it very slowly. Just relax your leg. This won't hurt. Okay, good. Everything is responding. Just a little slower than expected. Now, let's just do a quick Romberg test. Could you please stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thirty seconds… with my eyes closed. I’ll try to remain still, and I’ll try to focus on my breathing. It’s… a bit unnerving, standing with my eyes closed. I’m afraid I might lose my balance. I’ll try to remain calm, and I’ll try to focus on my breathing. It’s… a bit unnerving, standing with my eyes closed. I’m afraid I might lose my balance. I’m trying to remain still, and I’m trying to focus on my breathing. It’s… a bit unnerving, standing with my eyes closed. I’m afraid I might lose my balance. It’s… a bit disconcerting, truthfully. I’m trying to remain calm, and I’m trying to focus on my breathing. It’s… a bit disconcerting, truthfully. I’m afraid I might lose my balance. It’s… a bit disconcerting, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that’s alright. You can open your eyes. Okay, Lilyanna. Thank you for your cooperation. That’s enough for now. Let’s sit down and discuss what we’ve found. Based on the exam, you have some mild imbalance and slightly diminished reflexes. We'll need to do some further testing to determine the cause.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. Mild imbalance… diminished reflexes… It’s… a bit disconcerting, truthfully. What sort of further testing… is required? I’m a bit anxious, truthfully. What could be causing this… imbalance? I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. What sort of further testing… is required? I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. Is it… something serious? I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. What sort of further testing… is required? I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. Is it… something serious? I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. What sort of further testing… is required? I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. Is it… something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, it’s understandable to be anxious. Let's not jump to conclusions. Mild imbalance and diminished reflexes can have many causes, most of which are not serious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. Then, a vitamin B12 level – deficiency can sometimes cause balance problems. Finally, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. The MRI is the most important test, but it’s also the most involved. It’s a non-invasive scan, and it will give us a detailed look at your brain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI… of my brain… That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it… is it something you suspect? I’m a bit… frightened, truthfully. What would an MRI… reveal? I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. And the other tests… the blood count and vitamin level… are those… routine? I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. What would those tests… reveal? I’m a bit… frightened, truthfully. Would the MRI… require a contrast dye? I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. I’m… I’m a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. I’m… I’m a bit frightened, truthfully. I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. I’m a bit… anxious, truthfully. Would the MRI… require a contrast dye?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. I understand your fear, and I want to reassure you. I’m not suspecting anything serious, but it’s important to rule out all possibilities. The MRI is a precautionary measure, a detailed scan to get a clearer picture of your brain. Think of it like taking a detailed photograph – it helps us see everything clearly. The CBC and vitamin B12 tests are routine blood tests, they help rule out common causes of balance problems like anemia or vitamin deficiency. Regarding the MRI, we may use a contrast dye to get even clearer images, but we can discuss that in more detail if it's needed. It’s a safe procedure, but I understand your concerns. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Allergies… to contrast dye… I… I don’t recall ever having an MRI before, Doctor. I’ve never been asked about contrast dye. I don’t… I don’t think I have any allergies, generally. I’ve never had a serious reaction to… anything, as far as I know. But… I’m a bit… apprehensive, truthfully. What kind of reaction… could occur? I’m a bit… frightened, truthfully. And… what if the MRI… reveals something… concerning? I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. What if it’s… something serious? I’m a bit… frightened, truthfully. I’m… I’m a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. And… how long does the MRI… take? I’m a bit… apprehensive, truthfully. Would it be… painful? I’m a bit… vulnerable, truthfully. I’m a bit… frightened, truthfully. I’m a bit… overwhelmed, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, it’s good you’ve never had an MRI before, so we’ll go through everything carefully. The most common side effect of contrast dye is a warm sensation during the injection, and sometimes a metallic taste in your mouth. More serious reactions are very rare, but we’ll be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure. If the MRI reveals something concerning, we'll discuss it in detail, explain all your options, and develop a plan together. It’s important to remember that we’re doing this to get a clearer picture, and we’ll address any concerns step-by-step. The MRI usually takes about 30-60 minutes, and it’s painless. You'll lie on a table, and a large magnet will create detailed images of your brain. You won't feel anything during the scan, but you’ll need to remain very still. Before we schedule the MRI, I’ll have my nurse give you a detailed information sheet about the procedure and potential risks. And I’ll be happy to answer any further questions you have. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. Would you like me to have my nurse contact you to arrange the appointments?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please have your nurse contact me. I… I think I need a little time to… digest everything. I’m… I’m a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. Thank you… thank you for explaining everything so… thoroughly. I… I appreciate your patience. I’m… I’m a bit frightened, truthfully. But… I suppose it’s best to… know what’s going on. I’m… I’m a bit anxious, truthfully. I think… I think that’s all for now. I… I’m a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in touch to schedule the appointments. We’ll take it one step at a time. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
