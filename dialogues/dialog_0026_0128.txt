DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it's my joints, mostly. They get so stiff in the mornings, you know? It’s… hard to get going. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. It just is, now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Stiffness in the mornings is… a common complaint. It’s alright if you don’t remember specifics; we’ll try to piece things together. Could you tell me a little more about where you’re feeling the stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… everywhere, I think? My hands, for sure. And my knees. Sometimes my shoulders too. It’s not… sharp pain, not usually. More like… everything is just stuck. Like an old… rusty gate, maybe? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, actually. A rusty gate is a very good description. And it’s not sharp pain… okay. Is it worse at any particular time of day, besides the mornings?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely the mornings. After I've been sitting for a bit… like, if I'm having my coffee, and I try to get up… oof. That's the worst. Later in the day it's… better. Not gone, but better. I do a lot of walking with the little ones, you know, at the daycare. I think that helps move things around a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the mornings, improves with activity… that’s helpful to know. You mentioned walking at the daycare – does that walking cause you any pain, or is it more that it helps loosen things up?
PATIENT: Oh, no, it doesn't cause pain. Not usually. A little bit sometimes, if it's a really long walk. But mostly it feels… good. Like I need to move. If I sit too long, that's when it gets really bad. It's… hard to explain. It’s like I need to oil the hinges, you know?
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly. "Oiling the hinges" – I think a lot of my patients would understand that feeling. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my hands feel a little swollen, maybe? But I'm not sure if that’s from the arthritis, or just… getting older. I don't really get much pain, just the stiffness. And… I get tired, but who doesn't? I just thought it was… part of getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're thinking about it, Lilliana. It’s easy to dismiss things as “just getting older.” Swelling in the hands… and fatigue. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like arthritis before?
PATIENT: Arthritis… oh dear. I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. The doctors… well, I’ve seen a few over the years. It all gets a bit blurry. I think one of them mentioned something about my joints, a long time ago, but I can’t remember what he said. It was… a long time ago. My husband… he usually handled all that.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. It's not uncommon to forget details over time. And it sounds like you have a lot on your plate. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh. That’s… tricky. My mother had some trouble with her hands, I think. Something with the joints. But I don’t know what it was. And my father… he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. I had a sister, but she… she passed away a long time ago. I don't really remember much about her health. It’s… been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mother with some joint trouble… that's potentially relevant. It's alright that you don't recall much detail. Now, Lilliana, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no medications, really. Just… sometimes a pain reliever for a headache. But that's not very often. And allergies… hmm. I think I was allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven't been stung in years! I don't think I have any serious allergies. Nothing that I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, bee sting allergy as a child… Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, Lilliana, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your joints, range of motion, and get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It's probably a good idea, yes. I’m just… a bit worried it will be something serious. But I suppose we have to find out, don’t we?
DOCTOR: Yes, we do. We’ll take it one step at a time. And I will explain everything as we go. Alright, let’s start with your hands. Could you gently make a fist for me, and then open your fingers wide?
PATIENT: Okay. There. It feels a bit… tight, doesn’t it? Like I haven’t used them in a while.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a little bit of stiffness there. And I notice some mild tenderness when I press here and here. Now, could you try bending your fingers down towards your palm, one at a time?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… not very comfortable. Especially this one. It feels… stuck. Like it wants to bend, but it won't quite go all the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. And your wrists… any pain when I move them up and down like this?
PATIENT: A little bit. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It feels a bit… grating, you know? Like bone rubbing on bone.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your knees… any swelling or warmth there?
PATIENT: Sometimes, a little bit. Especially after a long day at daycare. They don't feel warm, not usually. But they feel… achy, you know? Like they've been used a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you bend your knees, do you feel any clicking or popping?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. There's a bit of a… creak, I suppose. Like an old door again! It doesn't hurt, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, your shoulders… any pain or stiffness there?
PATIENT: They get a little stiff when I reach up high. I don’t really think much of it, to be honest. Just… part of getting older, I suppose. It’s not anything terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Lilliana. That was helpful. Based on the exam and what you've told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis. However, to confirm that and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests and an X-ray of your hands and knees. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests and X-rays… That sounds a bit serious, doesn't it? But… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don't want anything too frightening. Are they… painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: They are not painful at all, Lilliana. The blood test is just a small sample, and the X-ray is a quick image. It's more about getting information so we can understand what's going on and create the best plan for you. The results usually take a few days to come back - I’d estimate around five to seven business days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, we can talk about some things you can do to manage your symptoms. Would you like to discuss some potential treatment options and lifestyle adjustments?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. I’m just… I don't want to be stuck. I like being active with the children. I don't want this to stop me. What sort of things can I do? And… will I need medication? I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We will definitely try to avoid medication if possible. There are several things you can do to manage your symptoms and stay active. First, gentle exercise is very important. Things like walking, swimming, or water aerobics can help strengthen your muscles and keep your joints moving. We can discuss some specific exercises that are safe and effective for you. Secondly, maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the stress on your joints. And finally, using heat or cold packs can help relieve pain and stiffness. We can also look into assistive devices like a cane or wrist brace if needed. As for medication, we can start with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if needed. If those aren't enough, we can discuss stronger options. However, we will only use medication if necessary, and we will start with the lowest dose possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Gentle exercise, healthy weight… I can do those things. I do like to walk, and I suppose I could try to eat a bit better. Heat packs… I think I have one somewhere. What about the daycare? Will I still be able to work with the children? That's… very important to me.
DOCTOR: That's a very important question, Lilliana. And yes, I believe you should still be able to work with the children. We may need to make some adjustments to your workload, like taking more breaks or avoiding activities that put too much stress on your joints. But I don’t want this to stop you from doing what you love. We can discuss a plan that allows you to stay active and healthy while managing your symptoms. Perhaps we can talk to your employer about some reasonable accommodations. In the meantime, listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. It's okay to rest when you need to. Does that sound like a good approach?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reassuring. Reasonable accommodations… I hadn’t even thought of that. Listening to my body… I suppose I should try to do that more. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… put my mind at ease a bit. What happens now? The tests, the appointment…
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help. Now, the nurse will draw some blood for the tests, and then we’ll schedule an X-ray for your hands and knees. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment – likely in about a week – to discuss them in detail and create a personalized treatment plan. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I feel… much better prepared now. I suppose I should go and see the nurse.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Yes, please see the nurse at the front desk – she’ll take care of the blood tests. And remember, listen to your body. It was a pleasure meeting you, Lilliana. Take care, and we'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too!
