DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fabing. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Just need some forms filled out, really. Medicare’s been askin’ for some updated stuff. Don’t really need to talk about anything health-wise, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Right. Forms. Well, while I can certainly help with those, it’s generally good practice for me to at least have a brief understanding of your overall health. It’s part of providing good care, even if you’re just updating paperwork. It helps me flag anything potentially relevant, you see. It doesn’t have to be a long discussion. Just a quick rundown. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. I didn’t realize… I guess that makes sense. Okay. Um… well, I work out on the reservation, mostly installin’ and fixin’ valves for water lines and stuff. It's pretty physical work, keeps me movin’. I’ve been doin’ it for… oh, about fifteen years now. No big problems with that, thankfully. I’m married, live with my husband. We both try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Is there anything specific you need to know? I don’t really go to the doctor much, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Fifteen years of physical work… good for you keeping active. And you and your husband eat reasonably well, that's positive. You mentioned not seeing the doctor much. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that's about it. And the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. Never been in the hospital for anything long-term. Just regular check-ups with the tribal nurse when I was younger, and she always said I was healthy as a horse. I mostly just try to avoid gettin’ sick, you know? Stay bundled up in the winter, drink plenty of water… that kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Right, childhood illnesses. Not particularly relevant now, I suspect. And avoiding illness is always sensible. Do either you or your husband have any ongoing health problems?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. My husband, Dale, he's got a bit of high blood pressure, but he takes medicine for it and keeps it under control. He sees Dr. Reynolds over in Browning for that. Other than that, we’re both pretty good. He's a carpenter, so he stays active too. Mostly just aches and pains from workin’ with his hands, you know? Normal stuff. Should I be tellin' you more? I just figured you needed info for the forms.
DOCTOR: Well, it is helpful to have a complete picture. It helps me understand any potential risks, even if it seems unrelated. Let’s move on to allergies, if you don't mind. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, that I know of. Dale’s allergic to bee stings, he carries an EpiPen, but that's him, not me. I can eat pretty much anything. No rashes, no trouble breathin’… nothin’ like that. We do have a cat, a little tabby named Misty, and I don’t think I'm allergic to her, but sometimes my eyes get a little itchy after I pet her, now that I think about it. But that could just be dust, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, a mild reaction to a cat… possibly dust. It’s good to be aware of it, at least. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don’t really believe in takin' pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to stay healthy naturally, you know? Maybe a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s it. Dale takes his blood pressure medicine, like I said, but I don’t take anything regularly. I’m pretty stubborn about that sort of thing. I figure if I can avoid it, I will.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that's… good. It's always best to avoid unnecessary medication, I suppose. Now, before we finalize these forms, let's just do a quick physical exam – just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… standard things. It won’t take long. If you’ll just hop up on the table there.
PATIENT: Oh. I thought you just needed the forms filled out… I wasn't really expectin' a physical exam. Is that really necessary? I just want to get Medicare off my back. Is there any way we can just skip that part? I'm not really comfortable with… you know. People pokin' and proddin'.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, with all due respect, filling out forms without a basic understanding of your health status is… inadequate. It's a minimal examination, simply to establish a current baseline. It doesn't involve anything invasive. Blood pressure, pulse, listening to your breathing – it's standard procedure. It takes five minutes, and it protects both you and the system. Frankly, I'm obligated to do it. Now, if you'll just step onto the examination table. We’ll get this over with quickly.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. But just the basic stuff, okay? No pokin' and proddin'. And if it takes more than five minutes, I’m leavin'. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, if you could just breathe deeply through your mouth… Heart sounds normal, rate is 72. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128 over 78. Pulse is regular. Everything appears within normal limits… for now. Ears and throat are clear. No obvious abnormalities detected. Now, we can finish up with the forms.
PATIENT: Good. Glad that’s done. So, can we just get the forms signed now? I've got things to do, and I really need to get back to the reservation. Is there anything else you need to know? I really thought this was just gonna be paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few final questions to verify the information. You stated you have no allergies. To clarify, have you ever experienced any reaction – even a mild rash or itching – to any medication, food, insect bite, or environmental factor?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Like I said, Dale’s got the bee allergy, and I get a little itchy sometimes when I pet Misty, the cat, but that's probably just dust. But I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, been bitten by all sorts of bugs… never had a problem. Are you sure you need to ask so many times? I've told you already.
DOCTOR: It’s a matter of due diligence, Ms. Fabing. Medicare requires a thorough record. And your current medications… you stated none. To be absolutely clear, have you taken any vitamins, supplements, herbal remedies, or over-the-counter medications – even occasionally – in the past six months?
PATIENT: Seriously? I told you, no! Maybe a multivitamin once in a while, when I feel like I'm comin' down with somethin'. But that's it. Dale takes his blood pressure pills, but I don’t take nothin’ regularly. I stay healthy naturally, you know? I eat good food, get plenty of sleep, and avoid gettin' sick. I’m startin' to feel like you don’t believe me. Are you accusin' me of somethin'?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, I am not accusing you of anything. I am simply verifying information for legal and medical accuracy. This is standard protocol, and frankly, your reluctance to provide a straight answer is… concerning. It’s my professional obligation to ensure a complete and accurate medical history. Now, to be perfectly clear, have you experienced any changes in your vision, hearing, or balance in the past year?
PATIENT: What?! I’m tellin’ you the truth! I have not experienced any changes in my vision, hearing, or balance! I can see perfectly fine, I hear just fine, and my balance is just fine! I work outside all day, installin’ valves and fixin’ pipes! If I had problems with my vision or balance, I wouldn’t be able to do my job! Are you tryin’ to trick me? Or are you just don’t believe what I’m sayin’? This is ridiculous! I just want to fill out the forms and get out of here! I’m starting to regret comin’ in here at all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, I understand your frustration. However, your defensiveness is… unhelpful. It’s my responsibility to gather accurate information, and inconsistencies – however minor – require clarification. Now, let’s try a different approach. You stated you work installing and fixing water valves. Is this work physically demanding?
PATIENT: Yes. It is. Very. I lift heavy things, climb ladders, crawl under houses… It’s hard work. That's why I stay healthy. I have to be strong to do it. Is that what you’re gettin’ at? You think I’m not strong enough to do my job? I’ve been doin’ this for fifteen years. I think I know my own limits.
DOCTOR: I am not questioning your physical capabilities, Ms. Fabing. I am attempting to establish a comprehensive medical history to ensure your overall wellbeing. It's my professional obligation. However, your repeated insistence that you have no health concerns, despite a physically demanding occupation, is… atypical. And it raises certain… red flags. Now, let's return to your family history. Do either of your parents have a history of hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Red flags? What are you talkin' about? I told you, I'm healthy! I just don't like takin' pills or goin' to the doctor! That's all! My mom… she had high blood pressure when she got older, but she didn't take care of herself. Always smokin' and eatin' junk food. And my dad… he was fine. Never had any problems, except for a bad back. He worked construction his whole life. Is that what you wanted to know? Or are you just gonna keep tryin' to find somethin' wrong with me? I swear, I've never met a doctor like you.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, I understand your skepticism, but I assure you, my intention is not to “find something wrong” with you. It's to obtain an accurate medical history, as I’ve repeatedly stated. Your mother’s history of hypertension is relevant, given your physically demanding occupation. And your father’s back problems… while not directly related, it indicates a potential predisposition to musculoskeletal issues. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you currently smoke, consume alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: I don't appreciate you askin' me about my personal life. No. I don’t smoke. Haven't touched a cigarette in my life. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And I definitely don't use any drugs. Are you thinkin' I'm some kind of… addict or somethin'? This is outrageous! I came here to fill out forms, not to be interrogated about my lifestyle! I want to see my husband. I'm leaving now. I'll just go somewhere else to get these forms filled out. Someone who actually believes me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fabing. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Obtaining these forms elsewhere may prove… problematic. And a thorough medical evaluation is in your best interest, regardless of your personal beliefs. I wish you good health, despite your… reluctance to cooperate. <>
