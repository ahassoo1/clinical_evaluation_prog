DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… a check-up, I think. Something about needing clearance for… work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. They sent me over. A performance thing, maybe? It's a lot of running around, I remember that. I mostly just want to get this over with quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. A work clearance check-up is perfectly reasonable. We can definitely get that sorted out for you. It’s alright if things are fuzzy – we’ll take our time and figure out what’s needed. “A lot of running around” is helpful – can you tell me a little more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I’ve done a bit of everything, over the years. Mostly… around theaters, I suppose. Ushering, taking tickets, helping people find their seats. Lobby work, you know? It’s not… strenuous, usually. Though sometimes you have to move fast when the crowds are getting impatient. It's been a long time, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I'm afraid I don't recall much detail. Is there a form I need to fill out or something?
DOCTOR: That gives me a better picture, thank you. So, it involves being on your feet, some quick movements, and assisting patrons. We’ll tailor the check-up to that. Yes, there is a form. It's a standard work physical questionnaire – mostly about your medical history and current health. It will help me focus my questions and the exam. Take your time with it, and if you have any trouble, just let me know. We can go through it together.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A form. Yes, that makes sense. It is small print, isn’t it? I’ll do my best. Just… give me a moment. And please, don't hesitate to interrupt if I'm rambling. I tend to do that when I’m trying to recall things. I haven't filled out one of these in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. Take all the time you need. And please don’t worry about rambling – I’m happy to help jog your memory if needed. I will absolutely interrupt if you'd like me to. It's perfectly alright. I’ll just be over here reviewing your basic information in the system while you work on that. Let me know when you're finished, or if you get stuck on a particular question.
PATIENT: You know, this question about “prior surgeries”… I honestly can't remember if I’ve had any. It was so long ago… I think maybe my tonsils when I was a child? But beyond that… nothing comes to mind. Is it okay if I just write “unknown”? It's rather frustrating not knowing these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, “unknown” is perfectly acceptable. It's very common for patients to have difficulty recalling details from many years ago, especially regarding childhood procedures. We can also note “possible tonsillectomy” to reflect your recollection. It’s important to be honest about what you do and don’t remember. Let’s move on to the next section. Don't get bogged down on details you can’t recall. We can always err on the side of caution. What about allergies – do you have any known drug, food, or environmental allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any major reactions to anything, as far as I recall. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen is bad, but everyone gets that, right? Nothing that requires medication or anything. Just a bit of… discomfort. I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything serious. Could I put "none"? I really want to get through this quickly, if you don't mind. It’s just… tiring trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: “None” is perfectly fine, Mr. Krahn. Occasional seasonal sniffles don't typically need to be listed as allergies. We’ll note “no known drug or food allergies, occasional seasonal symptoms”. Alright, good. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing on a regular basis. I used to take something for… my joints, a few years back. But that was a long time ago, and I stopped when it didn’t seem to be helping much. Right now… no, nothing. Just a little ibuprofen occasionally for a headache. But that’s hardly regular. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. So… no. No medications. Does that answer your question? I hope I’m not being too vague. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being vague at all, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly alright to not recall specific details. “Intermittent ibuprofen for headaches as needed” is what we'll note. Occasional use like that doesn’t require listing as a regular medication. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s another difficult one. My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. My mother… I believe she had something with her heart, but I don’t remember the specifics. And my father… he worked very hard, mostly outdoors. I think he had high blood pressure, but again, it was years ago and I wasn’t very involved in their medical care. I don't have any siblings, and I'm divorced, so… not much family around to ask about these things. I’m afraid I can’t provide much information. Is it alright if I just leave that section blank? It's not my strongest area. I’m really sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s very common for patients to have limited information about their family history, especially when parents have passed away and details are hazy. We'll note “family history largely unknown due to deceased parents.” Okay. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’ll need to check your vital signs – that’s your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate – and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general condition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I’m not fond of being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind my saying so. But if it’s necessary for this clearance, then I suppose I can endure it. Just… please be gentle? And let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm a bit of a… worrier, you see. I just want to get this done and go home. Hopefully, it won’t reveal anything too alarming. I’m trying not to think about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain each step before I do it. If anything feels uncomfortable, please tell me immediately, and we can stop or adjust as needed. I understand your apprehension, and we'll take things at your pace. If you’d like, you can sit up on the edge of the table for the initial vitals. I’ll start with your blood pressure. This may feel a little tight on your arm for a moment, but it shouldn't be painful.
PATIENT: Alright. A little tight is okay, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t cut off my circulation. I do get a bit… anxious about these things. I’m not very good with medical procedures, even simple ones. Just… try to be quick, if you would? And tell me if you see anything… concerning. I’m trying not to dwell on it, but my mind tends to wander. It’s a bit of a nervous habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m starting now. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 148 over 85. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute. That's within the normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. I’ll need to listen on your chest and back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I'm always a bit… self-conscious when someone is listening to my chest. I'm not very good with enclosed spaces, either, so being near the stethoscope feels a bit… restricting. Just try to be gentle, if you would? And tell me if you hear anything concerning. I'm trying not to dwell on it, but my mind tends to wander. It’s a bit of a nervous habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Just breathe normally. And now, I’m listening to your lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a very faint murmur. It’s quite subtle, and not necessarily indicative of a problem, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear – no wheezing or crackling sounds. Overall, your physical exam is largely normal. The slight murmur is something to note, but it’s not immediately concerning. Would you like me to explain what a murmur is?
PATIENT: A murmur… oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Not immediately concerning… but still concerning, I suppose. Yes, please, explain it to me. But… try to keep it simple? Medical terminology tends to overwhelm me. I'm not very good with technical explanations. Is it… serious? Will I need further tests? I'm starting to get a bit anxious again. I really didn't want to hear anything alarming.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a deep breath. A heart murmur is simply an extra sound heard when listening to your heartbeat. It’s not necessarily a sign of a problem – many people have innocent murmurs that don’t require any treatment. It's often caused by blood flowing through the heart valves. In your case, it’s very faint, and I don't hear any other concerning signs. However, to be on the safe side, I would recommend a simple echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of your heart – just to get a better look at the valves and ensure everything is functioning properly. It’s a non-invasive test – meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… no needles, you say? That sounds… slightly better. Non-invasive is good. I really don’t like needles. But an ultrasound… I suppose it’s better than nothing. If it’s the only way to make sure everything is alright, then yes, I suppose I’m open to it. But… how long will it take? And will it be uncomfortable? I get a bit anxious about being enclosed in small spaces, you see. And will I need a referral? I don’t even know where to start.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. An echocardiogram is a very straightforward procedure. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. You'll lie on a table, and a technician will apply a gel to your chest and use a handheld device to create images of your heart. It’s painless – you won’t feel anything at all. As for the enclosed space, you’re not fully enclosed – you’ll be lying on a table in a room, and the technician will be right there with you. If you’re feeling anxious, just let them know, and they can adjust the positioning or take a break if needed. I'll write you a referral to a cardiologist – that’s a heart specialist – who can perform the echocardiogram. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have a preferred hospital or cardiology group?
PATIENT: No enclosed space… that's good. And the technician will be right there… that helps. No needles is definitely a plus. I suppose I can tolerate it, if it’s only 30-60 minutes. No, I don't have a preferred hospital or cardiology group. Anywhere nearby would be fine, as long as they’re… gentle. And if they can explain things in simple terms, that would be greatly appreciated. I really don’t understand medical jargon. So, just a referral, then? Is there anything else I need to do? I really want to get this over with quickly, if you don't mind. I'm not very good with medical procedures, you see. It makes me quite anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve written you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance at City General Hospital. She’s a very experienced cardiologist, and her staff is known for being patient and explaining things clearly. I'll also include a note to the hospital requesting that they contact you promptly to schedule an appointment. Here's the referral. You'll need to bring your insurance card and a photo ID to the appointment. So, to recap: I've noted the faint heart murmur, recommended an echocardiogram with Dr. Vance, and provided you with a referral. The echocardiogram will give us a better understanding of your heart function. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… the echocardiogram, then? And I’ll contact Dr. Vance’s office? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I really appreciate it. It’s just… medical procedures make me quite anxious, you see. I'm not very good with them. I think I’ll just go home and try to relax. Hopefully, everything will be alright. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I completely understand your anxiety, and I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Wishing you all the best, and I hope you have a relaxing afternoon. .
