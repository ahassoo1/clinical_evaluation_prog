DOCTOR: Hi Delmon, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. Good to meet you too, Doctor. They tell me I have to come. Some man at the mine, he say I need check-up. No sickness, nothing wrong. Just...check-up because of the dust, I think. Long time I work down there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A check-up due to your work at the mine and potential dust exposure. That's very responsible of them to send you in. Even if you’re feeling fine, it’s good to be proactive. So, you said you haven't been feeling sick?
PATIENT: Sick? No. I feel…old, you know? But I always feel old. Been working hard all my life. This dust thing...is it bad dust? What kind of dust? They never tell old men like me anything. Just send us down there and tell us work faster.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Delmon. It's not right they haven’t explained things better to you. We’re going to figure out what kind of exposure you’ve had and make sure you're healthy. The dust at the mine can contain things like silica, coal dust, and other minerals – some of which can cause lung problems over time. To get a better idea of what’s going on, let's go through some questions. First, how long have you been working at the mine, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Eh...let me think. I start when I young man, after the war. Almost… sixty years, maybe? Sixty years I been down in that hole. I lose count long time ago. Plenty dust in those days. More dust than now, I think. But everything was more in those days.
DOCTOR: Wow, sixty years is a long time. That’s significant exposure. And you feel it was more dusty back then?
PATIENT: Yes! Much more. They didn't care about dust then. No masks, no nothing. Just work, work, work. The air…you could taste the dirt. Now, they give us masks, but they not good masks. Thin things. Still taste the dirt, just not so much. And the young men, they don't listen. Run around like chickens, breathing it all in. They think they strong. They will see. They will see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very important information, thank you. It sounds like the conditions were much worse when you started. And you're right to be concerned about the younger workers. Besides the dust, have you had any coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Coughing? Always coughing. Old man cough, you know? Been coughing since forever. Winter is bad. Chest tight. Shortness of breath...sometimes when I climb the hill to my house. But that's just old age, I think. Always been a bit breathless. I don't run no marathons, if that's what you thinking. I work in a hole. Not running.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're distinguishing between what might be normal for you as an active worker and anything new or concerning. So, the cough and breathlessness are things you’ve had for a long time. Has the cough or shortness of breath gotten worse recently, or changed in any way?
PATIENT: Worse? No. Not worse. Same old cough. Maybe a little more in the cold. Same old breathlessness when I climb the hill. Nothing new. I no doctor. I just know my body. And my body is old. And tired. You can check all you want, but you won’t find nothing wrong. It's just...life. And work. A lot of work.
DOCTOR: You’re right, you know your body best. And I’m not trying to find something that isn’t there. But even a “same old” cough or breathlessness can sometimes signal changes we need to investigate, especially with your long history of dust exposure. Would you mind if I listened to your lungs and checked your oxygen levels?
PATIENT: Oxygen levels? What for? You think I no get enough air? I breathe, don’t I? Look, I come because they tell me to come. I listen to them. But I no understand all this…checking and measuring. Just tell me if I can keep working. That’s all I need to know. I no want to be a trouble. I just want to work.
DOCTOR: I understand. And I will tell you whether it's safe for you to continue working, that’s my priority. Listening to your lungs and checking your oxygen levels are just quick ways to get a better picture of how well your lungs are working right now. It doesn't mean anything is wrong, it’s just information. It will help me make a better decision about your health and ability to work safely. It only takes a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. If you say so. But don’t keep me long. I got things to do. And tell me straight. No beating around the bush. Can I keep working or no? I no want to waste my time. And yours. Hurry up, then. My back is killing me just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Straightforward answers, I promise. And I'll be as quick as possible. Just breathe normally, nice and deep. Okay… and now on your chest.
PATIENT: Hmph. Used to better chairs. You hear anything? Is it bad? Tell me now. I no like waiting. I got things to do, you know. Things. Important things. Not sitting in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Okay, Delmon. I heard some slightly quieter breath sounds than I'd expect, but nothing alarming right this moment. It’s subtle, and could be related to your age and years of work. Let’s just get a quick oxygen level reading to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oxygen...what’s good oxygen? What’s bad oxygen? You always with the numbers. Why you can’t just tell me? Is it safe to work or no? I got grandchildren to see, you know. Important grandchildren. Not got all day to sit here with machines.
DOCTOR: Okay, your oxygen level is 92%. For someone younger, that would be a little low, but given your age and years of work, it's not immediately concerning. Here’s what I’m thinking, Delmon. The slightly quieter breath sounds and lower oxygen level suggest your lungs may be a little affected by the dust exposure. It doesn't mean you can't work, but it does mean we need to be cautious. I want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any significant damage. And I recommend we discuss limiting your exposure as much as possible, making sure you have a properly fitted mask at the mine, and regular check-ups to monitor your lung health. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: X-ray? More machines? More waiting? Limiting exposure…how I limit exposure? I need to work. I got bills to pay. And the mask…they give us thin masks. No good. Useless. I don’t want no X-ray. I want to know if I can keep working. Straight answer. Yes or no. Don’t tell me about limits and machines. Yes or no? You young doctors…always with the tests. Old men just need to work.
DOCTOR: Delmon, I understand you're worried about your job and bills. And I wish I could just give you a simple “yes” or “no.” But it’s not safe to do that without more information. Here’s what I can tell you: Continuing to work as you are – with limited protection and no further evaluation – carries a risk of worsening your lung health. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture and help me make a more informed decision. I will work with you. I can help you fill out any paperwork to explore options for better protective equipment at the mine. And I can discuss options for work modifications, if needed. But I strongly recommend the X-ray. It's a quick procedure, and it will give me the information I need to protect your health. If you refuse the X-ray, I cannot confidently say it's safe for you to continue working in your current situation. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmph. Stubborn young doctor. Always with the rules. Fine. X-ray. But quick. No waiting all day. And you better help me with the paperwork. And the mask...you get me a good mask. A proper mask. Not these thin things. I don’t want to be a trouble. I just want to work. And see my grandchildren. Is that too much to ask? Just get it done. Quick. And no more tests after the X-ray. Understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Delmon. I understand. And you’re not being a trouble at all. I’ll get the order for the X-ray sent over immediately, and we’ll schedule it for as quickly as possible. I’ll also start researching options for a better-fitting mask and help you with the paperwork to request one from the mine. I promise, we’ll take it one step at a time. Once we have the X-ray results, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and make a plan together. No unnecessary tests. I’m here to help you stay healthy and keep working, as long as it’s safe to do so. Now, let’s get that X-ray order sent over. And I'll have my nurse come in and take your blood pressure while we wait. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Blood pressure…fine. Just get it done. Hurry up, then. I got things to do. And tell that nurse to be gentle. Old man skin, you know. Easily bruised. And make sure the X-ray place is close. I don’t want to be driving all over town. Just get it done. Quick. And no more talk. Just action. Understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Delmon. I understand. I’ll make sure everything is quick and gentle. I'll tell the nurse to be careful, and I’ll find an X-ray facility close by. I’ll be right back with the order. .
