DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiwane. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… good to meet you as well. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts, yes? The pre-insurance physical, they said. I have Medicare. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly correct. Medicare often requires a pre-insurance physical to establish a baseline before full coverage begins. It's good you're getting it done proactively. So, this will be a comprehensive check-up. We’ll go over your medical history, do a physical exam, and potentially order some routine labs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Routine… labs? What kind of labs? I do not… like needles. And what exactly do you need to know about my history? I am a healthy man. I work hard. Food processing, you understand. It is… physical work. Not sitting at a desk.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Kiwane, and we can certainly discuss minimizing what's needed. The routine labs are just to get a general picture of your health – things like a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. It helps us establish a baseline for future comparisons. As for your history, I just want to understand everything that could potentially affect your health - any past illnesses, surgeries, medications you’re taking, allergies, and family history. It helps me tailor the best care for you. You said you do physical work - that’s excellent! We'll definitely factor that into the assessment. To start, can you tell me a little about any past medical problems you’ve had?
PATIENT: Medical problems… hmm. I had the… the flu, maybe, a few times. Nothing serious. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. Yemeni trees are… different. More difficult. No surgeries, no medications. Just… hard work. Allergies? No. I eat everything. Everything is good. My family… my father had… old age problems. He got… slow. That is all. Is this enough? I do not understand why you need to know all of this.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Kiwane. Knowing there haven't been any major issues is good. And you're right, sometimes it’s hard to understand why we ask all these questions - it’s about building a complete picture. Knowing about your father's "slow" decline is useful - that could be related to a lot of things, and it’s good to have that information. Just to clarify, when you say “slow,” was that memory issues, difficulty with movement, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm. It was… both, I think. He forgot things. Simple things. And he moved… slower. Like an old turtle. He used to be very fast. A good farmer, my father. Strong. Then… not strong. He needed help with everything. It was… sad. I do not like to talk about it. Is this… necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult to talk about, Kiwane, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It is helpful, and yes, it's relevant. It could point to something we should keep in mind as we assess your health. We don't need to dwell on it if it's too upsetting. So, focusing on you now, and you mentioned you work in food processing. Can you describe the type of work you do specifically?
PATIENT: I… cut the meat. Big pieces of meat. And I… pack it. Into boxes. It is… cold work. Very cold. And sometimes… heavy. The boxes, they are not light. We work fast. The boss… he wants fast. We wear gloves. And… a coat. It is a good job. It pays the bills. Is that enough detail? I do not think it is… a complicated job. Just meat. And cold.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Kiwane. Knowing it's physically demanding and cold work is important. Repetitive motions and cold exposure can affect your muscles and joints, so we'll definitely keep that in mind. Do you experience any pain, numbness, or tingling in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Sometimes. In my hands. When they are very cold. Like… ice. Then they hurt a little. And… they are slow. It goes away when they warm up. I use hand warmers sometimes. The gloves are… not very warm. I do not complain. Everyone is cold. It is just… how it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds like it could be related to cold exposure and possibly some early signs of nerve irritation. We'll want to check that out more thoroughly. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes and sensation in your hands and arms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Neurological… exam? What does that involve? More poking and prodding? I do not… enjoy being poked and prodded. But… if it is necessary… I suppose. Just be… gentle, Doctor. My hands are important. I need them for work. And… quickly, if possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kiwane, and I assure you I'll be as gentle as possible. It won't be much poking and prodding, I promise. The neurological exam simply helps me check how your nerves are functioning - things like reflexes, strength, and sensation. It's a quick way to see if everything is working as it should. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart sounds first, then move to your hands. It should only take a few minutes. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quickly. And… do not surprise me. I do not like surprises. Start with the… blood pressure, you said. Get it over with. Quickly. I have a feeling this will take all day.
DOCTOR: I'll do my best to be quick and explain everything as I go, Kiwane. No surprises, I promise. Alright, this might feel a little tight, just for a moment. Take a deep breath… and relax.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. This is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/85. That's a little elevated, but not significantly. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths, in and out, while I listen. Everything sounds clear. No unusual sounds there. Now, let’s move on to your hands. I'm going to check your strength and reflexes. Can you squeeze my hand tightly?
PATIENT: There. Is that… enough? My grip is strong. I told you, I work with meat. It requires strength. Now what? More squeezing? This is… silly. Are you sure this is necessary?
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip is very strong! That's good. And your range of motion seems good as well. Now, I’m just going to lightly tap some areas on your hands with this little hammer to check your reflexes. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Your reflexes are present and symmetrical – that's good. And finally, I'll just quickly check your sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I lightly touch your fingertips?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. A little… sharp. And… yes, I feel that too. It is… cold. Your hands are cold, Doctor. Are you sure you are healthy? Perhaps you need a check-up. This is… enough. I have told you everything. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Kiwane. My hands are often cold – it's a common issue for doctors. I should probably invest in some warmer gloves! And yes, we're almost finished with the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, there are a few things we should monitor. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and we talked about some potential nerve irritation in your hands. We should also address the cold exposure you’re experiencing at work. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. It will give us a baseline to compare future results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: More blood tests? You keep saying more blood tests! I do not like needles, Doctor. Is this absolutely necessary? Can I not just… try wearing warmer gloves? And taking breaks from the cold? I have been doing this job for years. I am perfectly healthy. Are you sure you are not just trying to… make money?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the blood tests, Kiwane. I wouldn’t recommend them if I didn’t think they could be helpful. It's not about making money - my goal is to ensure you stay healthy and prevent potential problems down the line. Think of it as a preventative measure. The results will give us a baseline to compare in the future. If your numbers are normal, great! We won't need to do them again. But if they are slightly off, it will allow us to address it early before it becomes a more serious issue. Wearing warmer gloves and taking breaks is a good idea, and I absolutely encourage you to do that. But the blood tests will give us a more comprehensive picture. We can also discuss some stretches and exercises to help improve circulation in your hands. Would you be willing to consider the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. But… quickly. And gently. And… tell me exactly what you are looking for. I want to know why you are taking my blood. Do not just poke and prod without explaining. I do not trust doctors. You always want something. What are you looking for, exactly? And… how long will it take? This is… very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your skepticism, Kiwane. It's good to be informed and ask questions. I’m happy to explain everything in detail. The complete blood count checks for anemia, infection, and other blood disorders. The basic metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. The lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels – important for heart health. And the thyroid stimulating hormone level helps us rule out any thyroid issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. The tests will take about 10-15 minutes. I'll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We have a very skilled phlebotomist who is gentle and experienced. I'll be here with you during the process. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan to keep you healthy. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Fine. Ten minutes, you said. And… gentle. I suppose… I have no other choice. But… if it is too painful… I am warning you. And… no surprises. Do not tell me you need more tests after this. Just the ten minutes. And then… I am finished. Let us get it over with. Where do we go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. And I promise, just the ten minutes. No surprises. I will be right here with you during the procedure. Follow me, please. The phlebotomist, Maria, is just over there. She will explain everything to you and get started when she’s ready. She's very good. Just relax, take a few deep breaths, and it will be over before you know it. I'll be nearby if you need anything. Let me know if you have any questions before we begin.
PATIENT: Just… quickly, please. I do not like this. This is… very unpleasant. Let us get it over with. And… no sharp objects. Do not surprise me.
DOCTOR: Maria will be with you in just a moment. She’s very gentle and will explain everything. Remember, deep breaths. And I will be right here, if you need anything. Maria, could you please assist Kiwane with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly. And gently. No surprises. Do not poke me too much. I do not like needles. This is… very unpleasant. I am not happy about this.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Ow! That… that hurts. Quickly… quickly, please. Get it over with. This is… very unpleasant. I do not like this at all.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Kiwane. You're doing great. Just a few more seconds. Maria is very skilled, and she’s being as gentle as possible. Breathe deeply… in and out.
PATIENT: Ow… ow… that… that hurts. Quickly… please… quickly. I feel… faint. Is it almost… almost done? I do not like this at all. This is… very unpleasant. Almost… almost… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Almost there, Kiwane, almost there. Just a few more seconds. Maria is just about finished. Take a deep breath, in and out. You’re doing great. Okay, all done. All done now. That was the worst part. Here, take a sip of water. You're doing very well. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: That… that was terrible. Absolutely terrible. I do not like needles. I will never do that again. Never. I feel… faint. And… dizzy. And… very, very weak. I need… I need to sit here for a while. Do not make me move. Just… let me rest. I do not like this at all. This is… very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Take all the time you need. There’s no rush. You did very well, Kiwane. It’s perfectly normal to feel faint and shaky after a blood draw, especially if you’re not fond of needles. Your blood pressure is a little low right now, which is understandable. It should return to normal soon. I’ll stay with you for a few minutes until you feel a little better. Just breathe deeply and relax. I’ll let Maria know you need a few minutes to recover. You’re doing great. Just take it easy.
PATIENT: Thank you… thank you. I do not like… being poked and prodded. I am not happy about this at all. I need… I need to sit here for a while. And… I need to know when the results will be ready. When… when will I know what you found? And… what if it is bad? What if… what if something is wrong? I do not like this at all. This is… very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious after this. We’ll take things one step at a time. The results should be ready in about 3-5 business days. Once they’re ready, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We’ll go through everything together, and I’ll explain everything in a way that’s easy to understand. Right now, let’s focus on getting you feeling a little better. Try to relax, and take deep breaths. And remember, we’re just looking for a baseline. Most likely, everything will be perfectly normal. But if something is off, we’ll address it together, and we’ll create a plan to get you feeling your best. How are you feeling now, Kiwane?
PATIENT: A little… a little better, I think. But… still dizzy. And… anxious. Three to five days… that is a long time. What if I get worried? What if something is wrong? What if… what if I need more tests? What if… what if something is seriously wrong? And… what if I faint again? I do not like this at all. This is… very unpleasant. I need to sit here for a while. Do not make me move. Just… let me rest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Kiwane. It’s perfectly normal to feel this way, especially after everything you’ve been through today. Waiting for results can be difficult, but we’ll get through this together. If you get worried before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’ll do our best to address any concerns you have. And if you start to feel faint again, or if you experience any unusual symptoms, please call 911 immediately. Right now, let’s focus on getting you feeling a little better. Try to relax, and take deep breaths. I’ll stay with you for a few more minutes, and then we can slowly get you up and moving. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable right now?
PATIENT: Just… just let me rest. Do not make me move. And… do not talk about the results. I do not want to hear about it. I do not want to worry. Just… just let me rest. Maybe… maybe I need some water. But… do not make me move. Just… just let me rest. I need… I need to calm down. I do not like this at all. This is… very unpleasant. Just… just let me rest. For a few more minutes. Do not make me move.
DOCTOR: Kiwane, if you’re feeling a little better, we can slowly get you up and moving. But only if you’re comfortable. We can take things one step at a time. There’s no rush. But if you’re feeling up to it, we can slowly get you up and moving. Only if you’re comfortable. If you’re comfortable, we can slowly get you up and moving. But only if you’re comfortable.
