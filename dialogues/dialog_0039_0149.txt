DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Kamahele, is it? Seems like a long name. Well, I’m not exactly coming in, am I? My daughter insisted. Said I needed to… get checked. Honestly, I feel just fine. Fine as a fiddle. Though my feet… they've seen better days, of course. I am a podiatrist, you know. Used to be, anyway. A good one, too.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Kamahele is a bit of a mouthful! And it’s wonderful you were a podiatrist – that’s quite a career. It sounds like you've been very active. Even feeling “fine as a fiddle” it’s good to get things checked, especially as we get older. Your daughter sounds very thoughtful. So, even though you feel generally well, are there any little things bothering you?
PATIENT: Little things? Hmm. Well, there’s this… fuss they’re trying to make about my heart. Something about it being “irregular.” Honestly, it feels perfectly normal to me. Always has. Beats just fine when I need it to, doesn’t it? They want to put things in me, you know. Little wires and… I don’t even want to think about it. Waste of time, if you ask me. And frankly, a bit insulting. I’ve lived a long life, haven’t I? What’s a little… flutter?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It sounds like you’ve been told you have an irregular heartbeat, and you're understandably hesitant about any procedures. It's perfectly reasonable to question things and want to avoid unnecessary interventions. To help me understand a bit better, can you tell me if you've noticed any symptoms along with this “flutter”?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. What kind of symptoms? I… well, I get a bit tired, I suppose. But who doesn’t get tired at my age? And sometimes my ankles swell up a bit, but that’s probably just from… sitting too long. I used to walk all the time, you know. Used to. Now I prefer my chair. Honestly, I think they worry too much. Always poking and prodding. It’s just… old age, dear. It happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tiredness and ankle swelling. Those can be related to a number of things, and it’s good you’re noticing them. It's also helpful to know you’ve noticed a change in your activity level. Just to be thorough, have you ever experienced any shortness of breath, dizziness, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Oh, sometimes. But that’s just when I walk up the stairs, dear. My house has stairs. A lot of stairs, actually. Dizzy? Not really. Maybe a little lightheaded sometimes when I stand up too fast. But that’s just… you know, getting older. Chest pain? Hmm… not exactly pain, but sometimes a little… tightness. A little uncomfortable. But it comes and goes. Honestly, I probably just ate something heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell. That's helpful to know. The shortness of breath with stairs, the occasional lightheadedness, and the tightness in your chest… those are all things we need to consider, even if they seem minor to you. Do you recall when these symptoms first started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did they start? That’s a difficult question, dear. Seems like… a while ago, now. A few months, maybe? Or was it longer? Honestly, time just sort of… blends together at my age, you know? I suppose the tiredness has been getting worse lately, and the swelling too. As for the tightness… I don’t really remember when that started. It comes and goes so often. I really don’t pay much attention to these little things, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Wynell. It’s common for things to feel a bit hazy as time goes on, and it’s also common to brush off little things. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you insist. But I tell you what, don’t go poking around too much. And don’t be surprised if everything seems perfectly normal. I’m a very healthy woman, you know. Healthy for my age, anyway. Just… be gentle, alright? I don’t like a lot of fuss. And don’t go trying to convince me I need any of those… wires.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. Gentle is my middle name – well, not really, but I promise to be very careful. And I assure you, I’m not trying to convince you of anything. Just gathering information to help us understand what’s going on. Okay, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. And I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm. It’s not alarming, but it does correlate with what we’re discussing. Now, let’s take a look at your ankles. I see a little swelling here, as you mentioned. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… not surprising, dear. I told you my blood pressure was probably a little high. I get anxious when people poke and prod, you know? And the ankles… well, they swell up sometimes. It’s just old age. A little tenderness when you press, yes. Not much. Just… uncomfortable. Honestly, I think it's all just a waste of time. My daughter will be thrilled, though. She always worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness with the swelling. I understand your feeling that it might be a waste of time, Wynell, but it's important for us to rule things out and make sure we’re not missing anything serious. Your daughter’s concern is understandable – it's good to have someone looking out for you. To get a better understanding of what’s going on with your heart, I’d like to order an EKG – that’s a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. And I also recommend a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a guinea pig. Wires and blood… it's just too much fuss. I really don’t see the point. I feel perfectly fine, you know? Just a little tired and a little swollen. My daughter will insist, of course. She always gets her way. Fine. Do your tests. But I’m warning you, I’m not promising to do anything they suggest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for that. These tests are simply to help us get a clearer picture so we can make the best decision together about your health. You are absolutely right, you’re not promising anything. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly, and you can decide what, if anything, you want to do next. Alright, I'll get the orders sent to the lab. They'll contact you to schedule the tests. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… not really. I suppose… will these tests hurt? And will they take long? I have my afternoon tea, you know. Can’t be late for that. And… will my daughter be able to come with me? She always likes to ask questions. Honestly, I just want this all over with as quickly as possible. And I don't want any wires.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Wynell. The EKG is completely painless – it just involves placing some sticky patches on your chest. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, but it’s quick as well. And yes, your daughter is absolutely welcome to come with you – in fact, I encourage it. It’s helpful to have someone there to ask questions and support you. And I promise, we'll talk through all the options before making any decisions about “wires” or anything else. We'll respect your wishes every step of the way. Do you know where the lab is located?
PATIENT: The lab? Oh, goodness. No, I haven't the faintest idea. It's probably… somewhere around town. I don't get out much these days, you know. My daughter usually takes me everywhere. She'll know where it is. Honestly, I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I need to be home for my tea. And I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It's perfectly normal to dislike needles. Let me write down the lab address and phone number for your daughter. Here you go. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, and the phone number is 555-1234. Your daughter can call to schedule an appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, dear. 123 Main Street, you say? I’ll be sure to tell my daughter. No, I suppose that’s all. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. And… please don’t let them put any wires in me. I’m too old for wires. And I really need to get home for my tea.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. No promises have been made about any wires, and we'll respect your wishes. I understand your eagerness to get home for tea – that’s important. Here's the lab information again. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We're happy to help. It was lovely meeting you, Wynell. Please take care. .
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Thank you. You were very kind. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must get going. My tea is waiting. And please… no wires. .
