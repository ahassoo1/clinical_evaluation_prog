DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA Clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card so I can drive for… well, a ride-share service. Something about a commercial driver’s medical card, that’s what they told me. I hope it’s not too much trouble. I just want to get it done quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, San. It’s a fairly standard exam for a commercial driver's license – specifically, the Department of Transportation, or DOT, physical. It just ensures you're medically fit to operate a vehicle safely. To start, let’s go over some basic information and then we’ll get to the specifics of the exam. I see here your age is 70, and your race is Japanese. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Seventy years old, and Japanese. Born and raised in Japan, actually, but I’ve been here a long time now. Everything’s correct so far. Though, you don't need to write down everything, do you? Just what's important for the driving, right?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, San. We only need information relevant to your ability to drive safely. I ask for some basics to confirm identity and medical history, but we'll focus on things that could affect driving. Okay. And what about your height and weight?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I’m… about 5 foot 2 inches, I think. And around 140 pounds, give or take. It fluctuates, you know? I used to be much lighter, but… well, age happens. Is that close enough?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, San. We can always double-check if needed. 155 centimeters and 63 kilograms, noted. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Not that that helps with driving, mind you! Though, maybe it does – you need to be able to handle a bumpy road, right?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, San. A strong constitution is always helpful! Now, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. Even things you take occasionally are important to know.
PATIENT: Just Medicare, mostly. For my arthritis, you know? I take a little something for that, helps with the pain in my hands. I can’t remember the name off the top of my head… it’s a small white pill. And sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, but not every day. The doctor told me to only take it when it gets high. It's… amlodipine, I think? Is that right? I have trouble remembering names sometimes, even for things I take myself!
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine for blood pressure as needed, and a medication for arthritis. Do you happen to know the name of the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s the tricky part. It’s… a little orange pill. I get it from the pharmacy, but the name… it escapes me. Let me think. My grandson usually fills it for me. He'd know. It starts with an 'N', I think. Naproxen? No… something like that. I really wish I could remember! It helps with the stiffness, that's all I know. I take it every morning.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, San. Medication names can be confusing. We can verify this with your pharmacy records if that’s alright with you. In the meantime, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as heart problems, diabetes, lung disease, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: That’s a good idea, checking with the pharmacy. Yes, please do. My memory isn't what it used to be. Let me see… I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. When my grandson was just a little boy. But I recovered fully. And I have arthritis, of course, that’s why I take the pills. Nothing else, really. No heart problems, no diabetes, and my lungs are fine. I used to walk every day, but my knees don’t allow that anymore. Is that enough? Do you need to know about when I broke my wrist as a child? It wasn’t serious.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, San. Pneumonia, arthritis, and no other major medical conditions. The broken wrist as a child isn't usually relevant unless it caused lasting problems, so we don't need to worry about that right now. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. When I was still living in Japan, actually. And… I think that’s it. A very routine surgery, the doctor said. Nothing fancy. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember much about it. I recovered quickly, though. I was back to work in a few weeks. Is that important for driving? I mean, it was years ago.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, noted. It's good to know, but it shouldn’t affect your driving ability now if you've fully recovered. Now, a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a tough one. My family… we lived a long time, mostly. My mother lived to be 95, and her mother even longer. No heart problems that I know of, but… my uncle, on my father’s side, he had… I think it was diabetes. Yes, diabetes. And my sister, she had cancer, but she beat it. A long time ago. Otherwise, everyone was pretty healthy. Old age got to them, eventually. Does that help? It's hard to remember so far back. We didn't talk about health much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, San. History of diabetes and cancer in the family, noted. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, could you briefly tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh dear. Well, I don’t smoke, never have. And I drink very little. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. I used to walk a lot, like I said, but my knees won’t let me anymore. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is nice. And I spend a lot of time with my grandson. He’s a good boy. That's about it, really. Nothing too exciting. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, San. It sounds like you live a very healthy life despite your knee problems. Now, just a final few questions before we move on to the physical exam. Have you ever had any vision or hearing problems?
PATIENT: Let me think... My eyesight isn't what it used to be, of course. I wear glasses, as you can see. I need them to read and drive. My hearing… is okay, I suppose. People sometimes say I don't listen very well, but that’s probably just old age! I don’t have any trouble hearing you speak, though. And I’ve never had any serious problems with either one. I go to the eye doctor once a year. I think that’s all. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, San. Corrected vision, and no significant hearing problems. Excellent. Now, we’ll move on to the physical exam. It will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and reflexes, as well as listening to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a doctor's appointment later this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. Just tell me what I need to do. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. We’ll keep it as quick and efficient as possible. Please have a seat here, and I'll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. We can monitor this during the exam. Now, let's check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Good. Now, let's move on to your vision. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. 142/88… I suppose that’s not too bad. My doctor always says I get nervous at the doctor's office, and that makes it go up. Alright, let's see that chart. Um… E… F… P… T… Is that right? Are those letters getting smaller? It’s harder to see them now. I need my glasses, right? Is that the chart with the little letters?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are the letters. And yes, you are correct, it is better with your glasses. Let’s just do it with your glasses on, and then we'll get a more accurate reading. Okay, now can you read the bottom line for me?
PATIENT: Oh, much better. Let me see… L… F… P… T… 7… 2… Yes, I can read those! Much easier with my glasses on. Is that what you wanted to see? I told you, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. But I can still drive, you know. Carefully, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are doing very well, San. Your vision with correction is 20/30 in both eyes. That is perfectly acceptable for driving. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds are regular and within normal limits. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright, that's good to hear. No wheezing, that's a relief. My mother always worried about my lungs. Okay, check my reflexes. Whatever you need me to do, just tell me. I used to have very quick reflexes when I was younger, but I'm sure they've slowed down a bit. Do I need to close my eyes? Just hurry, if you don’t mind. I have that appointment to get to, you know.
DOCTOR: No need to rush, San. And no, you don’t need to close your eyes. I’m just going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. It will just check your reflexes. Good reflexes, San. Both knees are responding normally. Now, let’s do a quick check of your range of motion. Can you please rotate your head, bend forward, and raise your arms?
PATIENT: Ouch… that's a little stiff. But yes, I can do it. Oh dear, my back isn't as flexible as it used to be. And raising my arms… it's a little uncomfortable. Arthritis, you know. Is that okay? It's not very graceful, I'm afraid. I haven't been doing much gardening lately because of my knees and back. It's a little difficult to move around.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. I understand. Limited range of motion is common with arthritis. It doesn’t necessarily affect your ability to drive safely. Now, I’m just going to do a quick neurological exam, checking your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay, walking… Be careful now. My knees are a little wobbly. Is that alright? I'm trying to be careful. I don't want to fall. My grandson worries about me, you know. He's a good boy. He always tells me to take it easy. But I like to stay active, even if it's just a little bit.
DOCTOR: You're doing very well, San. You have a slightly unsteady gait, but it doesn’t appear to be significantly impacting your balance. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, let’s review your results and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… will I be able to drive? That’s all I really want to know. I need to be able to drive my grandson to school, and run errands. It’s important for me to be independent. Will I get the card? Is that what all this was for? Just tell me straight, Doctor. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Alright, San, I understand your concern. Based on the physical exam, there are a few things we need to address before I can issue the medical card. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your range of motion is limited due to arthritis. However, these are manageable conditions. I recommend following up with your primary care physician to get your blood pressure under control. I’m also going to recommend a brief consultation with a physical therapist to help improve your range of motion and strength. With proper management, I believe you will be able to safely continue driving. However, I need documentation from your doctor and physical therapist confirming that your conditions are stable and don’t pose a risk while driving. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So… I can’t get the card right now? I need to see another doctor and a… physical therapist? Oh dear. That’s a lot of trouble. I just wanted a quick check-up, and then I could get on with my life. I don’t have time for all this. I guess… I guess I can talk to my doctor. But a physical therapist? Oh dear. I'm an old woman, Doctor. I don't need to be doing exercises. I just want to drive. Is there anything else? Do I need any other tests? I really don’t want to make a lot of appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, San. I wish I could just issue the card right now, but I have a responsibility to ensure your safety and the safety of others on the road. No, you don't need any other tests at this time. Just documentation from your primary care physician confirming your blood pressure is under control, and a brief assessment from a physical therapist. It doesn't need to be a long-term commitment – just a one-time assessment to see what exercises might be helpful. I can provide you with a referral form for a physical therapist, and a form for your doctor to complete. It’s really just a formality, to ensure everything is stable. Once I receive those forms, I can issue the medical card. Would you like me to print those out for you now?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, yes. Please print those out. I suppose I have no choice. My grandson will be very happy, though. He worries about me driving, and this will make him feel better. But honestly, Doctor, this is a lot of trouble for an old woman. I just want to be able to drive my grandson to school. Please just give me the forms. And tell me how long it usually takes for them to get back to you. I don’t want to be waiting forever. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. Here are the forms. The referral is for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly recommended physical therapist nearby. The medical documentation form is for your primary care physician. Typically, it takes about a week or two for the forms to be returned. Once I receive them, I’ll review them and let you know if everything is in order. If everything looks good, I can issue the medical card immediately. I'll also give you my direct number, in case you have any questions or concerns during the process. Please don't hesitate to call. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I just hope my doctor doesn't give me too much trouble. And I hope the physical therapist isn't too… energetic. Well, I should get going. I have a lot of phone calls to make. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. You've been very patient with me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. And please, take care of yourself and drive safely. .
