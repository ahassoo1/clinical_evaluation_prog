DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away. Been going on for… oh, goodness, I’d say about three weeks now. And my heart… it just doesn’t feel right sometimes, you know? It feels weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for about three weeks and some heart palpitations… feeling weak, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, weak. Not all the time, but especially when I try to do a bit more… like, if I’m making a bigger meal for the family, or even just walking up the stairs. It feels like it's working too hard. And with the cough, it just takes my breath away sometimes. It's a dry cough, mostly. Doesn't bring up much at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. So three weeks of a dry cough, gets worse with activity, and you’re noticing some shortness of breath and a feeling of weakness, especially with exertion. Do you recall anything that started around the same time as the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Around three weeks ago… Oh! Yes, actually. My grandson, Mateo, he had a bit of a cold. Nothing terrible, just a runny nose and a little sniffle. I was holding him a lot, you know, cuddling him. He was staying with me for a few days while his mother was at a conference. Could it be… from him? Though I usually don’t catch things so easily. But he was quite close to me.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Nadene. Being around Mateo while he was sick could definitely be a factor. And it’s good you mention you don’t usually get sick easily. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe the cough a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a deep, chesty cough, like when you have the flu. It’s more… tickly. Like something’s irritating the back of my throat. And it comes in bursts, you know? A few coughs in a row, then nothing for a while, then it starts up again. Sometimes it happens when I lie down, keeps me up a bit at night. I’ve been trying to drink warm tea with honey, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tickly cough, bursts of coughing, worse when lying down, and only partially relieved by tea and honey. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your heart. When you say it feels weak, can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, it's hard to explain. It's not pain, exactly. It's more like… fluttering, sometimes. Like a little fish flopping around in my chest. And other times, it just feels heavy. Like it's working very hard to pump. It doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does, I have to slow down. I used to be able to walk to the store, no problem, but now… I get winded easily. And sometimes my ankles get a bit swollen at the end of the day. Though, I do like my salt, I’ll admit.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluttering sensations, heaviness, and getting winded easily, especially with walking, and some ankle swelling. And you mention enjoying salt. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this cough or the heart symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Definitely not. I've felt a little tired, maybe, but I’m eighty-nine years old, Doctor! I get tired easily these days. But no, nothing like a fever. And I don’t sweat much at night. Just the usual… a bit warm under the blankets sometimes. But nothing unusual there. I sleep pretty well, all things considered. It’s mostly just the cough that wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Just some fatigue and the cough interrupting your sleep. Now, let's go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, years ago, the doctor told me I had something wrong with my heart. It’s a bit of a blur now, but it was something about it not pumping as well as it should. They put me on some medicine for it, I’ve been taking it ever since. And I had my gallbladder removed a long time ago, but that wasn’t too bad. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to stay active, eat well, you know? Though, like I said, I do like my salt. I think it's important to enjoy life!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of some heart condition, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal. Do you happen to know the name of the heart medication you're taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Here it is! Let me put my glasses on… Ah, yes. It says… Digoxin. Is that right? Digoxin. And I take… 0.125 milligrams every day. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, probably fifteen years now? Something like that. It helps keep my heart steady, the doctor said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Digoxin 0.125 milligrams daily for about fifteen years. Good. And just to be complete, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything! I used to love seafood, but my teeth aren’t what they used to be. So I can’t chew much anymore. But no, I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything in my life. I’ve been very fortunate, really. Though my grandson is allergic to peanuts, so I have to be careful when he's around. But that’s him, not me!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies for you, but your grandson has a peanut allergy. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctors poking and prodding! Just be gentle, my bones are a bit fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nadene. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 85. Your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, and I can hear a murmur. Your lungs sound a little wheezy, and there’s some mild swelling in your ankles. I'm going to document these findings. Now, given your history of heart condition, the irregular rhythm, the swelling, and the cough, I want to do a few tests just to be sure we know what’s going on. I'd like to order an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, a chest X-ray to see your lungs, and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a BNP level to check for heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests! But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t want anything serious, you know? But if it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, go ahead. The EKG, the chest X-ray, the blood work… whatever you need. Just… explain things to me afterward, alright? I don’t understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nadene. I understand your anxiety, and I promise to explain everything in plain language. The EKG is a quick, painless test that shows your heart’s electrical activity. The chest X-ray helps us see your lungs and heart. And the blood work gives us a lot of information about your overall health and helps us rule out certain conditions. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain where to go for the EKG and X-ray. While we wait for the results, it might be a good idea to limit your salt intake and avoid strenuous activity. In the meantime, is there anything else you're experiencing that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just… thank you for listening to me. It's good to know someone is taking my concerns seriously. I get a little forgetful sometimes, you know, so I worry about not mentioning something important. But yes, I think that’s everything. Limiting the salt and avoiding activity… I can do that. I’ll try my best. It's just… hard to say no to a good plate of pupusas.
DOCTOR: I understand completely about the pupusas! It's about finding a balance. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll work together to figure out the best plan for you. The nurse will be in shortly to start the tests. Just let me know if you have any questions before then. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if anything changes or you're feeling worse.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you again. I appreciate your kindness. I will let you know if anything changes.
