DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is… pleasant to meet you too. Well, it's a bit hard to explain, to be honest. I've been… feeling short of breath lately. And my mouth and eyes feel awfully dry, even when I drink water. It's been going on for a little while now, I think. Though I struggle to remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint when symptoms begin. “A little while now” is helpful, though. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When you say “short of breath,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… not like I’m gasping for air, Doctor. It’s more like… I have to consciously think about breathing sometimes. Like it takes more effort than it should. And it feels like I’m not getting enough air, even when I’m resting. Does that make sense? It's… frustrating to explain. I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous, either. Just… normal things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds like you’re experiencing some exertional dyspnea, even at rest, which is concerning. And the increased effort to breathe is also important. You mentioned your mouth and eyes feel dry; is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I think. It’s worse in the mornings, when I wake up. And it doesn't really go away entirely throughout the day. I find myself drinking a lot more water than usual, but it doesn't seem to help much. I've tried using eye drops, but those only work for a little while. I… honestly, I’m not sure what’s causing it. I haven’t changed anything in my routine recently, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this dryness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… I… I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps. Not severely, but… easily fatigued. And my joints… sometimes they ache. It’s not constant, either. Just… here and there. Mostly my hands and knees. I also seem to be a bit… warmer than usual, if that makes sense. I haven't taken my temperature, but I just feel flushed sometimes. I don’t know if any of that is related, though. I struggle to remember things clearly.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Ms. Kobler. Fatigue, joint pain, and feeling flushed are certainly relevant symptoms. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… That’s… difficult. I don’t have a regular doctor, you see. And I… I’ve moved around a bit. I was divorced a few years ago and… things were rather chaotic for a while. I don’t recall ever being diagnosed with anything serious. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. I had my vaccinations, I think. And… I had a surgery on my appendix when I was a teenager. Other than that… I really can’t recall much. I do have private insurance, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. We can work through this. Knowing you don’t have a regular doctor and experienced some recent upheaval is helpful. And thank you for letting me know about the appendectomy. Do you recall approximately when that surgery was performed?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That was… a long time ago. I believe I was around fourteen or fifteen years old. So… approximately twenty years ago? It was certainly before my divorce. I remember being quite ill afterwards, but I don’t recall any complications. It was just a standard appendectomy, I think. I apologize for being so vague. It's frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Kobler. You’re providing me with what you recall, and that’s perfectly fine. It’s understandable that details may be hazy after so long. Now, let's move on to your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult as well. My mother passed away when I was young, and I wasn’t very close to my father’s side of the family. I know my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something with her heart, I think. But I don’t know what exactly. And… my uncle, I believe, had diabetes. But I’m not certain. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk much about health matters. I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re providing me with valuable information, Ms. Kobler. Knowing about the potential heart condition and diabetes is helpful. We can always investigate further if needed. Now, concerning your social history, do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never smoked. And I don’t use any tobacco products. I don't care for them. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps one or two times a week. But I don’t drink heavily. And I don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m… rather straightforward in that regard.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kobler. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any serious allergic reactions that I recall. I once had a mild rash after using a new laundry detergent, but that was years ago. And… I’m a bit sensitive to penicillin, I believe. It doesn’t cause a severe reaction, but I get a bit of a stomach upset. Other than that… no, I don’t have any known allergies. I apologize if I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kobler. That’s a very thorough account. Based on what you’ve told me – the shortness of breath, dryness, fatigue, joint pain, flushing, and the sensitivity to penicillin – I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I just hope we can figure out what's causing this. It's rather unsettling to feel… unwell without knowing the reason.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kobler. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. If you'd be comfortable, please sit up on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. I'm hearing slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, particularly at the bases. No wheezes or crackles at this time. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. I will also check your blood pressure and pulse now… Blood pressure is 118/72, pulse is 88 and regular. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Your throat appears clear. No signs of inflammation. Your oral mucosa appears dry. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. I notice some mild swelling in your knuckles. Alright, Ms. Kobler. Based on the physical exam findings—diminished breath sounds, dry oral mucosa, mild swelling in your knuckles—along with your symptoms, I’d like to order some blood work to investigate further.
PATIENT: Blood work… Yes, that sounds… prudent. What exactly will the blood work check for, Doctor? Is it something serious? I… I apologize for being anxious. It’s just… unsettling to feel unwell and not know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Ms. Kobler. That’s why we’re here. The blood work will give us a clearer picture of what might be going on. We’ll be looking at a complete blood count to assess for anemia or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, your electrolytes, and blood sugar levels, and we’ll also check your inflammatory markers, such as your ESR and CRP, and your thyroid function. Based on your symptoms and the initial examination, we need to rule out a number of possibilities, including autoimmune conditions like Sjögren’s syndrome, which can cause dryness of the eyes and mouth, and possibly rheumatoid arthritis, given the joint swelling. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. I’m not jumping to any conclusions at this point. We just need more information. We'll also test for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Sjögren’s… and rheumatoid arthritis… Those sound… rather serious. I suppose it's good to know what we’re looking for. Is there anything I can do in the meantime, Doctor? Anything to alleviate the symptoms? The dryness is quite bothersome, and the fatigue is making it difficult to concentrate. And… is there any reason I should be particularly worried? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Kobler. It’s important to understand what’s going on. Regarding Sjögren’s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, it’s important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we need the blood work to confirm or rule them out. Many conditions can cause similar symptoms. In the meantime, to alleviate the symptoms, I recommend staying well-hydrated – continue drinking plenty of water. You can also use artificial tears frequently to help with the dry eyes. For the dry mouth, sugar-free hard candies or gum can help stimulate saliva production. And, to manage the fatigue, prioritize rest and avoid strenuous activity. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help with the joint pain, if needed. There’s no reason to be particularly worried at this point. We are investigating to get a clear diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, and then we can determine the next steps. I'm going to order the blood work now. The lab technician will draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take long. Do you have any preferences for where you'd like to receive the results?
PATIENT: Staying hydrated and resting… those are manageable. I appreciate the advice, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I'd prefer to receive the results… by phone, if that's possible. I don't have a regular email address, and I'm not very good with technology. A phone call would be much easier. And… how long do you anticipate it will take to get the results? A few days? A week? I apologize for asking yet another question.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kobler. We can absolutely contact you by phone with the results. That’s perfectly fine. And you're not asking too many questions at all, I assure you. The results typically take about 3 to 5 business days to come back from the lab. I will have my assistant call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you develop a high fever, severe shortness of breath, or any chest pain – please don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, try to rest and stay hydrated. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Thank you… thank you very much for your time and patience. I appreciate your kindness. I feel… a little less anxious now. I will wait for the phone call. And I'll try to rest and stay hydrated. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this, and we'll work together to develop a plan to help you feel better. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
