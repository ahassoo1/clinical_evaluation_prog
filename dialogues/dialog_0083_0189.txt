DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Rowbottom, Arbie Rowbottom. And pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. Look, I’m not one for fuss. Just… well, there was blood. In my stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. It’s not something an old man like me needs, is it? I’ve seen things, you know. Things that would curl your hair. But this… this is just inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s certainly concerning to see blood in your stool, and you’re right, it’s not something you want to deal with, especially given your age. We'll get to the bottom of this. To start, can you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was… red. Blood is red, isn’t it? Honestly, doctor, I’m not a painter. It wasn’t bright red like a fresh cut, more… darker. Like old jam, maybe? And it wasn’t everywhere, just… streaks. And honestly, I don't see why I have to tell you these details. Are you even a real doctor? You don't look like what I expect a doctor to look like.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem…detailed, Mr. Rowbottom. It's simply that the color and consistency of the blood can give me important clues as to the source of the bleeding. Darker blood often comes from higher up in the digestive tract, while brighter red blood usually indicates bleeding closer to the rectum. And yes, I assure you I am a real doctor. I specialize in Family Medicine, and I've been practicing for 21 years. To clarify, when you saw the streaks of darker blood, was it mixed in with your stool, or was it coating the outside?
PATIENT: Coating. Yes, coating the outside, definitely. Mixed in sounds awful. Like… well, never you mind what it sounds like. Coating. And it only happened this morning. I had a perfectly normal… movement yesterday, if you must know. Though, thinking about it, I did have a bit of a stomach ache last night. Nothing terrible, just a little rumble. Old age, probably. Everything rumbles eventually. Still doesn't explain the blood, does it? You should be able to figure this out. You are a doctor, after all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s helpful. Blood coating the stool and a stomach ache last night are both things we need to consider. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? I'm an eighty-eight year old man, everything aches! But… let me think. No fever. No chills. No… dizziness. Appetite’s been a bit off lately, but that's just getting older. I've always been a bit particular about my food. And I’m… regular, if you want to know. Haven't had trouble going to the bathroom, just this… incident. Honestly, I think it was something I ate. Probably that fish I had at the diner last week. That place isn’t as clean as it used to be, you know. Always a bit greasy. Probably got some bad fish. That's what it is. Bad fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or dizziness, appetite has been a bit off, and you are generally regular. You suspect it might be related to fish you ate last week. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Goodness. Where do I begin? Arthritis, of course. What old man doesn't have arthritis? High blood pressure, too, though it's been under control for years. Mostly just watch the salt, that's all. Had my gallbladder out, oh, must be thirty years ago now. And… I had pneumonia once, a bad case of it. Nearly did me in. Otherwise… nothing major. I've always been a tough old bird. Lived through a lot, you know. Two world wars, the Korean war… things now don't bother me much. Never smoked, never drank much. A bit of a rebel, I suppose. But generally healthy, for my age. Though this… blood… it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Rowbottom. Arthritis, controlled high blood pressure, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, and a history of pneumonia. That's helpful. And it's good to know you have never smoked and drink very little. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for the arthritis. A small blue pill. Can't remember the name of it. Doctor gave it to me years ago. Something-pril... or something like that. And… a baby aspirin, just to keep the blood thin. Prevent any… you know… blockages. That’s all. I don’t like taking pills. Mess with your system, they do. Prefer the natural way, if you understand. A good walk, a bit of sunshine. That’s what keeps an old man going. Not these fancy pharmaceuticals. Honestly, doctor, sometimes I think you doctors just like handing out pills. It's a racket, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation with medications, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate you telling me about the small blue pill and the baby aspirin. Let me check the system… Ah, it appears you’ve been prescribed Lisinopril for your blood pressure and you self-medicate with a low-dose aspirin. Now, about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had a bad heart. Died young, she did. Too much stress, I suppose. My father… he lived a long life, thankfully. But he had… well, he had trouble with his stomach. Ulcers, I think. Always complaining about indigestion. And my brother… he had diabetes. Nasty thing, that. Took him too early, it did. Rest of the family… pretty healthy, I suppose. Though, we didn't see each other much. Haida people… we tend to keep to ourselves. It’s the way things are. Lots of sadness in my family history, if you want to know. Lots of loss. But we’re a strong people. Always have been. That's why I'm still here, I suppose. Tough old bird, remember?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rowbottom. History of heart problems in your mother, stomach issues in your father, and diabetes in your brother. I appreciate you telling me. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, I just want to clarify a few things regarding your lifestyle. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Not to food, not to medication, not to anything. I've eaten everything under the sun, practically. Fish, shellfish, berries, roots… you name it, I've probably tried it. Though, I did have a bit of a reaction to a bee sting when I was a boy. But that was seventy years ago! I’m tough, remember? Allergic reactions are for weak people. I’ve always been able to handle whatever life throws at me. A little blood in my stool isn’t going to bother me, either. Though I do appreciate you asking, doctor. Shows you care. Still, no allergies. None whatsoever. Now, let's get this over with, shall we? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good to know. Okay, Mr. Rowbottom, I'm going to perform a physical exam now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and then I’ll need to do a rectal exam. This is to check for any abnormalities and to get a better sense of what might be causing the bleeding. It may be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as possible. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A what exam? Look, I'm an old man, not a… not a specimen! You expect me to… to what? Is that absolutely necessary? Honestly, doctor, I've lived a long life. I’ve had enough poking and prodding, thank you very much. Couldn’t you just give me something for it? A pill, perhaps? Or… something? I don’t like the sound of that exam one bit. It’s… invasive. And undignified. I’ve never… I mean, this is… unacceptable. I think I’d rather just go home and wait it out. It’s probably just a bit of indigestion, anyway. Bad fish, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I’ve upset you. You are right to question any procedure you're not comfortable with. The rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating the cause of rectal bleeding. It allows me to directly visualize the rectum and check for any signs of inflammation, polyps, or other abnormalities. It's the most accurate way to determine the source of the bleeding, and it helps me rule out more serious conditions. However, I respect your wishes. We can skip the exam if you prefer. But without it, it will be more difficult to determine the cause of the bleeding. We could proceed with some blood tests to check for anemia and inflammation, and potentially a stool test to look for blood. However, those tests won't give us as clear a picture. Another option would be a referral to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive health. They would be able to perform a colonoscopy, a more detailed examination of the entire colon, to identify the source of the bleeding. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A colon… what now? Honestly, doctor, you’re just making things worse! I don’t want any poking and prodding, or… or scopes, or whatever you call them. It all sounds dreadful. A specialist? More doctors? I’ve already had enough of you people for one day. Blood tests… that sounds alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't involve any needles. I hate needles. And a stool test… well, that’s just… unpleasant. But a colonoscopy? Absolutely not. No way. No how. Just do the blood tests and the stool test, then. And tell me if it’s just the fish. It has to be the fish. Bad fish. That’s all it is. Now, let’s get it over with, shall we? I haven’t got all day, you know. And try to be gentle. I'm a delicate flower, despite appearances.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. We'll proceed with the blood tests and a stool test. I will order those right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw some blood. As for the stool test, she will provide you with a collection kit and instructions on how to collect a sample at home. The blood tests will check for anemia, which can be caused by bleeding, and inflammation, which can indicate an infection or other problem. The stool test will check for hidden blood and other abnormalities. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or significant rectal bleeding, please come to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get it over with. Honestly, doctor, I don’t like all this fuss. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve survived worse than a little blood in my stool. It has to be the fish. Bad fish. That’s all it is. And if it is, I’m going to write a very strongly worded letter to that diner. And… tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. I really don't like needles. Now, I think I’ll just sit here and wait. Thank you, doctor. Or… I suppose you’re still a doctor. Still… bad fish. That’s what it is. I just know it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll let the nurse know to be gentle. And I understand your conviction about the fish. We'll see what the tests reveal. Please don't hesitate to let me know if anything changes. I'll be right back to check on you once the nurse is finished.
