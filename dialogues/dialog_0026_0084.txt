DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s…pleasant to meet you too. Um, well, it's a bit hard to explain, honestly. I’ve been…feeling short of breath, I suppose. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry, like the desert. It’s been happening for a while now, but it feels…worse lately. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and dry mouth and eyes…and you said it’s been going on for a while, but it’s worsened recently. It's alright if the exact timing isn't clear; we'll try to piece things together. Can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's just…things aren’t always so clear in my memory. Um, it doesn’t happen all the time. Mostly when I’m…doing things. Like, walking up stairs, or if I try to hurry anywhere. It’s not a painful feeling, exactly, more like…not enough air. And I find myself pausing to catch my breath. Does that make sense? I hope I’m explaining this alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Kobler. Don’t worry about explaining things; you’re doing just fine. So, it’s exertion-related—happens when you’re physically active. And you describe it as not enough air, rather than pain. Good. Has this impacted your ability to do things you normally do?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, a little. I…I enjoy writing, of course. But even reading sometimes…if I read for too long, I have to stop and rest. I used to be able to read for hours. And walking…I live not far from a beautiful park, and I love to walk there. But I find myself walking slower, and not going as far as I used to. It’s…disappointing, I suppose. It feels like I’m losing something.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when your body limits what you enjoy. Okay, so it's affecting your daily activities – writing, reading, walking. Have you noticed anything else that makes the shortness of breath worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s…hard to say. I don't recall anything specific. Perhaps when it’s very hot? I do feel more…uncomfortable when it’s warm outside. And…dust? I have a lot of old books, and sometimes when I’m dusting them, it seems to bother me more. But it could just be the dusting itself. I truly don’t remember if that’s connected. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. It's perfectly alright. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Heat and dust seem to potentially worsen it. Now, you mentioned dry mouth and eyes. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s…mostly constant, I think. It’s worse in the mornings, usually. And it doesn’t really go away completely. I find myself drinking water constantly. And I use eye drops…a lot. It’s not painful, but…uncomfortable. Like sand in my eyes, almost. I’ve tried different kinds of eye drops, but they only help for a little while. Do you…understand what I mean? It’s a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Constant dry mouth and eyes, worse in the mornings, requiring frequent water and eye drops. That gives us some good information. Now, let’s step back a little bit. Have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… Other symptoms… Let me see. I’ve been…tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I often feel a little tired, so it’s hard to say if it’s anything new. And…sometimes my joints ache a little. My hands, mostly. But again, that’s not a new thing. It comes and goes. I apologize…I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just…not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Kobler. It’s helpful for me to know what you don’t remember as well as what you do. Tiredness and occasional joint pain—okay. Now, just to cover all bases, have you had any fever, chills, weight loss, cough, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. No fever, no chills, definitely no weight loss—I wish I had lost weight! No cough, no chest pain, and my ankles and feet seem alright. No swelling, no…unusual discomfort. I’m really trying to think, Doctor. I just… things are so hazy. I hope I’m not forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Ms. Kobler. It sounds like we can rule those things out. Alright, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… I… I was diagnosed with something years ago, but I’m afraid I don’t recall the specifics. Something with my… thyroid, perhaps? It was treated with medication for a while, and then… I stopped taking it, I believe. I really wish I could remember more details. My divorce was…difficult, and I didn’t keep very good track of things after that. I apologize again. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Kobler. It’s understandable that things get lost in difficult times. Something related to the thyroid, treated with medication in the past. Do you know what kind of thyroid issue it was?
PATIENT: No, I truly don’t. I remember going to a doctor, and taking pills, and then… the doctor said it was okay to stop. I wasn’t very good at asking questions then, I suppose. I just…trusted what they said. It was a long time ago, and… I really don’t recall. I’m so sorry for being so unhelpful. Perhaps you could look it up in my records? If that’s possible?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. That’s what we’re here for. Let me check your electronic health record. Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis approximately 12 years ago. You were on levothyroxine for a period of time, but it was discontinued about 8 years ago after a period of normal thyroid function tests. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Hashimoto’s… levothyroxine… Yes…yes, that does sound… vaguely familiar. The names… they’re coming back to me. Hashimoto’s… and the pill… It was a small, white pill, I think. And yes, it was discontinued. The doctor said my thyroid was… okay. It’s…amazing that you found that. Thank you. I truly appreciate it. It feels… good to have some clarity, even a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kobler. It's what we're here for. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Surgeries… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe. A very long time ago. And… I was hospitalized once, many years ago, with a bad case of the flu. But that was also a very long time ago. I don't recall any other surgeries or hospitalizations. Nothing significant, at least. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t have much information about her side of the family. My father… he wasn’t very communicative. I know he had… heart problems, I believe. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, suffered from… arthritis, I think. But beyond that, I’m afraid I don’t have much information. I apologize for being so vague. My family wasn’t very close.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kobler. It’s not always possible to have complete family history information. So, mother passed away young, father had heart problems, grandmother had arthritis. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea, if you don't mind. I believe in a quiet, peaceful life.
DOCTOR: That's lovely, Ms. Kobler. A quiet, peaceful life sounds wonderful. Now, finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I’ve taken a few different medications over the years, but never had any problems. I don’t have any food allergies either. I eat… mostly everything. Unless… perhaps shellfish? I recall feeling a little unwell after eating some shrimp once, but it was so long ago, I’m not sure if it was the shrimp. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. Thank you for providing that information. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid gland, and examine your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. I trust your expertise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me…and exhale…Good. Your heart sounds regular, although I do detect a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll keep it in mind. Your lungs sound clear, but you do have slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no nodules or areas of tenderness. Your joints have a slightly limited range of motion, and there’s some mild tenderness in your hands, but no significant swelling or redness. I also notice some mild dryness of your skin. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with a possible thyroid issue and some mild joint inflammation. I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid hormone levels, complete blood count, and inflammatory markers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood tests… that seems sensible. Anything that might help us understand what’s happening… I’m happy to cooperate. I trust your judgment. And… what exactly will these tests tell us? If you don’t mind me asking? I apologize if I’m being a bother. I just… I like to understand things, if possible.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Kobler, it’s good you’re asking questions. The thyroid hormone levels will tell us if your thyroid is functioning properly. We'll check TSH, T4, and T3 levels. The complete blood count will look for any signs of anemia or infection. And the inflammatory markers, like ESR and CRP, will help us determine if there’s any underlying inflammation contributing to your joint pain. Based on the results, we can determine if your Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is active and whether or not you need to be started on thyroid medication. We'll also be able to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. I’ll give you a lab requisition, and you can take it to the lab downstairs. They'll draw some blood, and the results should be back in a few days. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough. Thank you, Doctor. A treatment plan… that’s good. I appreciate your patience and your explanations. I’ll go downstairs and get the blood tests done right away. And then I’ll just…wait for your call. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime? Any symptoms I should be particularly aware of? I truly appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kobler. Just try to get a good night's sleep and stay hydrated. If you experience any sudden chest pain, difficulty breathing, or significant swelling in your ankles or feet, please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just try not to worry too much. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s the requisition. Have a good day, Ms. Kobler. And hopefully, we'll have some answers for you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I truly appreciate it. I will get the blood tests done right away, and I’ll look forward to hearing from you. Have a good day as well, Doctor Finco.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
