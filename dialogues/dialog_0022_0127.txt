DOCTOR: Hello Gedalya, welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been getting weaker, slowly, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s mostly noticeable at the end of the day, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids… that certainly warrants investigation. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. When you say weaker, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… hard to explain precisely. It’s not like a sudden injury, it’s just… everything takes more effort. Lifting things, even just getting out of a chair. My arms feel it mostly, and my legs sometimes. It’s not constant pain, just… fatigue. And it gets worse as the day goes on, like you said. I find myself needing to rest more.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, gradual onset of weakness, predominantly in your arms and legs, worsening with activity and more noticeable later in the day. Do you notice it affecting any specific tasks more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Yes, actually. Stairs are… becoming a real problem. And I used to enjoy gardening, but lifting pots and things is much harder now. Even holding a cup of coffee feels… less stable, if that makes any sense? It’s like my grip isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stairs, gardening, grip strength… We’re building a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, other than the drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: That's a good point, I hadn’t really connected the two. Now that you mention it… yes, a little bit. Things seem… blurry sometimes, especially towards the evening. I put it down to needing new glasses, to be honest. But perhaps it’s connected? I haven’t been to the optician recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some blurry vision as well, worse in the evening. That’s important information. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Have you experienced any double vision at all?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, not that I've noticed. Everything seems…single, if that makes sense. Just blurry sometimes, but not doubled. I haven't seen two of anything, thankfully. Is that… is that a common symptom? I’m sorry, I don’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn't apologize at all—that’s what I’m here for. It's good to rule things out. Okay, good. No double vision. Have you noticed any difficulty with swallowing or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, nothing with swallowing. And my voice… No, I don’t think so. My ex-wife would certainly have noticed if my voice changed, and she’s… quite observant. Everything feels normal there, thankfully. It's just the weakness and the eyes, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. No changes in swallowing or voice. Good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had the usual childhood things, chickenpox and whatnot. But nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… I can’t really think of anything. I was always quite healthy, actually. Until recently, of course. I've never been a big fan of doctors, so I tend to avoid them unless absolutely necessary. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Alright, no significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been quite lucky in that regard. Broken a few bones as a child, playing football, but nothing that needed an operation. Just casts and a lot of complaining, I’m afraid. Is this all relevant, Doctor? I don’t want to bore you with unnecessary details.
DOCTOR: No, this is all helpful information. We just want to get a full picture. Okay, no surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of muscle weakness, eye problems, or neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: That's… a bit tricky. My mother’s side… my grandfather, I think, had something with his eyes when he was older. Something about cataracts, but I don’t remember the details. And my father’s side… they weren’t really ones for talking about health problems. Very stoic, you see. So, it's hard to say. No one really talked about muscle weakness, if that helps. I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. It’s a bit of a… mystery, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible cataracts in a grandfather, but generally not much family history available. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always found it a rather unpleasant habit. And my ex-wife… well, she wouldn’t have tolerated it. She was very health-conscious, you see. I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional alcohol. Now, any recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I've never touched anything like that. I'm a facilities manager, not… well, not that sort of person. I assure you. I deal with plumbing and heating systems, not… recreational substances. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications in the past. I’ve only ever taken over-the-counter painkillers for headaches, really. Nothing serious, I assure you. Is that… is that everything, Doctor? I'm starting to feel a bit… drained, to be honest. All this thinking!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know - no known allergies. No, I think we’ve covered most of the important questions for now. I understand you’re feeling a bit drained, it's perfectly normal after going through all of that. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and eye movements. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. I'm not exactly known for my strength these days, unfortunately. And… perhaps tell me what you’re doing as you go? Just so I know what’s happening. It’s… a bit unnerving, all this poking and prodding. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's perfectly alright. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. I’m going to tap on a few spots on your arms and legs with this little hammer. This is perfectly normal and shouldn’t be painful, just a bit surprising. Alright, good. Responses seem a bit… diminished, actually. A little weaker than I’d expect. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… harder than it looks, Doctor. I'm trying my best, but my grip isn't what it used to be. As you said, it's definitely weaker. Is that… bad? It feels like I'm not applying much pressure at all. My ex-wife used to be able to open jars with one hand… I can barely manage a tea towel these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel that. Your grip is weaker than expected. Now, let’s check your arms. Can you push against my hands, like you’re trying to straighten your arms?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s…difficult. It feels like there’s resistance, even though I’m not pushing against much. It’s… tiring, actually. I'm trying, Doctor, but my arms feel… heavy. This isn't very encouraging, is it? Is there anything… serious going on?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, there is some resistance and noticeable weakness. Now, let's check your legs. Can you lift your legs against my resistance, like you’re trying to bend your knees?
PATIENT: Like this? Oh… that’s… harder than it looks. It feels like my legs are filled with lead. It’s… definitely weaker than it used to be. I used to be able to do squats, no problem. Now… This isn’t good, is it? I feel…quite useless, actually. Is it… something I've done? A bad back or something? Or… something more serious? It’s all a bit frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, yes, there is significant weakness in your legs as well. Now, I'm going to check your eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes, and don't worry if it feels a bit strange. Okay, and… yes, I see some slight weakness in your eye movements as well, particularly when looking to the sides. Everything feels a bit… sluggish. Okay Gedalya, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination, I'm concerned about possible weakness in your muscles and some weakness in your eye movements. These findings could suggest a few different things. One possibility, given your age and symptoms, is Myasthenia Gravis, a condition that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles. Another possibility could be a neurological condition, but we need to rule out other causes first. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to do some further investigations. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for specific antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis. I’m also going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any other neurological issues. Would you be willing to schedule those?
PATIENT: Antibodies? MRI? It sounds… serious, Doctor. Very serious. Myasthenia… what did you call it? Is it… is it curable? Or… is it something I’ll have to live with forever? I just want to get back to normal. I want to be able to… lift things, garden, just… function. Yes, of course, I’ll schedule the tests. Whatever it takes. Please… just tell me it’s not… something awful. I'm a bit scared, Doctor, to be honest. And… who’s going to pay for all this? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Gedalya, it’s completely understandable that you’re scared. It’s a lot to take in, and I want to assure you that we’ll go through this step by step. Myasthenia Gravis is a serious condition, but it’s also manageable. It's an autoimmune disorder, meaning your body’s immune system mistakenly attacks your nerves and muscles. There’s no cure in the traditional sense, but with medication, lifestyle adjustments, and sometimes other therapies, many people can live full and productive lives. The goal is to control the symptoms and improve your quality of life. We will discuss all the options available to you, should that be the diagnosis. As for the tests, let’s focus on getting those done first. I’ll write up the orders now. I understand you don’t have insurance, which is a concern. We can explore options for financial assistance and see if there are any programs available to help cover the costs. The clinic has a social worker who specializes in helping patients navigate these challenges, and I will make a referral for you. I will also see if we can work with the lab and MRI facility to explore possible discounts or payment plans. Don’t worry about the financial aspect right now. Our priority is to get a clear diagnosis and start you on the right treatment path if needed. We have resources available, and we'll figure it out together. I want you to feel supported throughout this process. Here are the orders. The lab is just down the street, and the MRI facility is a short drive away. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to schedule the appointments?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. It's just… a lot to process. Myasthenia… I’ve never even heard of it. The lab is down the street, you say? And the MRI facility… a short drive? I… I can manage that, I think. And the social worker… that sounds… helpful. Very helpful. I… I don’t know what I’d do without that. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? Days? Weeks? And… what if it is Myasthenia? What does that… mean? Will I be able to… work? Will I need… help with everything? I live alone, you see. And… I just want to get back to normal. I really do. Is there anything… anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all? I feel… helpless. And scared. Very, very scared.
DOCTOR: Gedalya, it’s perfectly normal to feel scared and overwhelmed right now. You’re facing a lot of uncertainty, and it’s okay to feel helpless. Let’s break it down, step by step. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The MRI results might take a little longer, maybe a week or so, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. We’ll stay in close contact with both facilities to expedite the process as much as possible. I'll personally call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, it doesn't necessarily mean your life will be dramatically different. Many people with Myasthenia lead full and productive lives with the help of medication and lifestyle adjustments. There are different levels of severity, and treatment plans are tailored to each individual. We’ll explore all your options and create a plan that works best for you. As for working, that will depend on the severity of your symptoms. We can discuss options like modified work schedules, assistive devices, or, if necessary, temporary disability leave. We’ll also assess your overall functionality and determine what accommodations you might need. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do. Avoid strenuous activities that worsen your symptoms. Try to get plenty of rest. Eat a healthy diet. And most importantly, try to manage your stress levels. Stress can exacerbate Myasthenia symptoms. I'm going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help with any discomfort you’re experiencing. And remember, you’re not alone in this. I’m here to support you every step of the way, and our social worker will help you navigate any challenges you face. I’m also going to give you some resources to learn more about Myasthenia Gravis and connect with other people who are living with the condition. Here are the prescription and the resources. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get through this together. And I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, regardless of when we get the results, just to check in and see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve been very kind. And… reassuring. It’s… it’s still scary, but… a little less so. Resources… yes, that’s… helpful. To know… that I’m not alone. And the muscle relaxant… that sounds good. My muscles have been aching terribly, especially in the evenings. I… I appreciate everything you’ve done, Doctor. Everything. I just want to… get back to normal. To be able to… lift things, garden, just… live my life. Is that… is that possible? Even if it is Myasthenia? And… is there anything… anything at all I should be telling my ex-wife? She… she might be worried. She’s… quite involved, even after the divorce. She might… she might find out anyway. I don’t want to… upset her unnecessarily. It’s just… a lot. A lot to process. And… I'm very tired. And scared. Very, very scared. But… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I think… I think I'll go home now. And… try to rest. I guess. And… maybe look at these resources.
DOCTOR: Gedalya, you're very welcome. And yes, it is possible to live a full life even with Myasthenia Gravis. It requires management, but many people do it successfully. And you're not alone—we'll be here to support you every step of the way. As for your ex-wife, that's a personal decision. If you think she'll be worried and she’s a supportive person, it might be helpful to let her know. But you're under no obligation to tell her anything you don't feel comfortable sharing. It’s important to prioritize your own well-being and emotional comfort. You’ve been very brave today, and it’s perfectly okay to feel tired and scared. Focus on getting some rest, and remember to take things one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here for you. Take care, Gedalya. And please, don't hesitate to reach out.
