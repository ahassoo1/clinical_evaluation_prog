DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather bothersome, this… issue. It’s in my mouth. A white coating, you see. Not exactly a pleasant sight, and frankly, it’s affecting my appetite. I don't have time for these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white coating in your mouth… and it’s affecting your appetite. I understand you don’t have a lot of time, so we’ll try to be efficient. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea when exactly. It just… appeared. A few weeks ago, perhaps? I don’t pay close attention to such…details. I’ve been rather busy with work. Fallers don’t exactly have leisurely mornings examining their tongues.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. “A few weeks ago” is helpful. And you said it’s affecting your appetite – is it painful to eat, or just…unpleasant?
PATIENT: Unpleasant, Doctor. Very unpleasant. It’s not painful, exactly, but the texture… the feeling. It’s difficult to explain. It just makes me not want to eat. I’ve lost a bit of weight, I suspect, though my wife keeps telling me I’m imagining things. She always does.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, just an unpleasant sensation and decreased appetite. And your wife hasn’t noticed any weight loss?
PATIENT: She says she hasn’t. Women, Doctor, always downplaying things. She thinks I worry too much. Honestly, I just want a quick fix. Whatever it is, just make it go away. I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your frustration. Let's try to get a better look. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Quickly, if you please. I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is a white coating present on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. It doesn’t look deeply embedded, but it's definitely there. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… no, not really. Just the… unpleasantness in my mouth, and the lack of appetite. Perhaps a little fatigue, but that could be from the work. I’ve been rather stressed lately, managing the crew. Frankly, I haven’t had time to consider symptoms beyond the obvious. Is this serious? Because if it requires extensive testing, I’m afraid I can’t accommodate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms besides the coating, fatigue, and appetite loss. And you’re concerned about extensive testing. I understand. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I feel perfectly fine otherwise, a little tired perhaps. Swallowing is…normal. It’s just this coating. It's… unsightly. I maintain a certain image, you see. I’m a foreman; I can't be seen looking unwell. Does this require a visit to the… hospital? Because I assure you, that is out of the question.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or difficulty swallowing. Just the coating and fatigue. Okay. Have you been using any new mouthwashes, toothpastes, or medications recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've been using the same products for years. Sensodyne, if you must know. My wife insists. She’s very particular about dental hygiene. I assure you, I don’t experiment with such things. What is causing this? And more importantly, how do we fix it? I haven't the time for a lengthy investigation.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sensodyne toothpaste. And no new medications. It could be a few things, Mr. Schieber. One possibility is oral thrush, a fungal infection. It's often linked to stress or a weakened immune system, which you mentioned being tired. It can also sometimes be caused by certain medications, but you said you haven’t changed anything there. Another possibility is simply a buildup of bacteria, especially if you're feeling stressed and not getting enough fluids. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, I maintain a perfectly healthy lifestyle. I require stamina for my work. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, and perhaps a cigar on weekends, but nothing excessive. As for smoking… it’s… recreational. And frankly, I resent the implication that my habits are contributing to this… condition. Is this going to require a blood test? Because I have a meeting with the surveyors at three.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I wasn’t implying anything. I’m simply gathering information to make an accurate assessment. And no, a blood test isn’t immediately necessary. Just trying to rule things out. Let’s try a simple course of action first. I’m going to recommend an over-the-counter antifungal mouthwash – Nystatin. You can find it at most pharmacies. Rinse with it twice a day for a week. Also, make sure you’re staying well-hydrated. Plenty of water. And perhaps try to get a bit more rest if possible. Let's see if that helps. If it doesn't improve after a week, then we can discuss further options. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An over-the-counter mouthwash… Very well, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my schedule. Nystatin, you say? Twice a day. And more water. Frankly, I find it rather insulting that this is all it takes to address my concerns. But, if it’s a quick fix… then I suppose I’ll try it. But if this doesn’t work, I expect a more… thorough examination. Do I need a written prescription, or can I simply purchase it myself? And, please, no lengthy explanations. I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: You don’t need a prescription, Mr. Schieber. It’s available over the counter. I’ll write a brief note recommending Nystatin twice daily for one week and encouraging increased hydration. If there’s no improvement after a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we’ll discuss further testing options. Here you are. Now, do you have any other concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. I appreciate your… efficiency. Hopefully, this mouthwash will resolve the issue quickly. I haven’t time for this. Good day. .
