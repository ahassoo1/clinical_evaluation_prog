DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Hilber. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's...it's my water. I have trouble, you know, getting it all out. Feels like there’s always some left in there, even after I try. It’s been going on for a little while now, not getting better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. You're experiencing difficulty fully emptying your bladder, and it's been a persistent issue. That can certainly be concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe a bit more about this difficulty?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not painful, exactly. Just…weak. Like the stream kinda stops before I feel like I’m really done. I have to… push a little to get the rest out, and even then, I don’t feel completely empty. It happens most times, not every time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not painful, but you feel a weak stream that often stops before you feel completely finished, requiring you to strain to empty your bladder fully. And this happens frequently enough to cause you concern. Is this a sudden change, or has this been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn't just happen one day. Maybe over the last few months it’s gotten worse, but it’s been...off and on, you know, for longer than that. Hard to say exactly when it started, to be honest. I don’t pay attention to things like that until they bother me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. It's common to not notice gradual changes until they become bothersome. So, over the past few months it's been progressively worse, with a history of intermittent issues. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have to get up a couple of times at night to go. Not every night, but more than I used to. And sometimes...sometimes it just feels like I have to go all the time, even if I just went. Like it’s still there, you know? But when I try, it doesn’t always come out much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed increased frequency, especially at night, and a sensation of incomplete emptying, even after you’ve recently urinated. That’s helpful information, Mr. Hilber. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. The doctor at the village, Dr. Olsen, checked me a couple years back when I had a bad cold, and he said I was okay then. Blood pressure might be a little high sometimes, he said to watch my salt, but he didn’t give me any medicine for it. I’ve been trying to eat less salty food since then. Other than that… no, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no known diagnosed medical conditions, although Dr. Olsen mentioned slightly elevated blood pressure a couple of years ago, and you've been monitoring your salt intake. That’s good to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a young man, working on a boat. They fixed it up at the hospital in Anchorage. That was a long time ago, though. Besides that…no, I don’t think so. Nothing else I can remember. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm repaired in Anchorage some time ago. No other surgeries or hospitalizations to note. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regular. Sometimes I take something for aches and pains, like ibuprofen, when my joints bother me. But that’s it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They never seem to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you occasionally use ibuprofen for joint pain, but no regularly scheduled medications. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any medical problems, particularly kidney problems, prostate issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My father… he died when I was young, heart trouble, I think. My mother lived a long time, but I don't really remember if she had any… special sicknesses. She mostly just got old. My sister, she’s still alive, lives down in town. I haven’t talked to her in a while. She might know something, but I don’t really keep track of that kind of thing. Nobody really talked about sickness much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Hilber. Family medical history can be difficult to recall, especially if it wasn't frequently discussed. It's helpful to know your father had heart trouble. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My father smoked, though. It didn't do him any good, that’s for sure. I always figured it was best to stay away from it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Hilber. Avoiding smoking is very good for your overall health. And, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe on a weekend. Nothing too much. I don’t go out drinking, and I don't need it, really. More of a habit than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so moderate alcohol consumption – a beer with dinner occasionally. That's good to know. Finally, could you tell me a bit about your work and daily activities?
PATIENT: Well, I work at the shoe factory here in town. I run one of the machines, makes boots mostly. It's not too hard work, but I’m on my feet most of the day. Besides that, I mostly just keep to myself. I like to fish when I can, and I do a little bit of carving in the winter. Nothing fancy. Just keep busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. That gives me a much better understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to examine your abdomen and perform a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. This is standard procedure when evaluating urinary issues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, that’s fine. Blood pressure is good. I'm okay with you listening to my heart and lungs. The…the other part… a rectal exam… hmm. I've never had one of those before. Is it… necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s a sensitive exam, and it's perfectly normal to feel uneasy. A digital rectal exam allows me to assess the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate, which can provide valuable information about potential causes of your urinary symptoms. It is a crucial part of the evaluation, and helps to rule out some possibilities. I will explain everything carefully and make sure you are comfortable throughout the process. It usually takes just a minute or two. If you are absolutely uncomfortable with it, we can discuss alternative options, but it may limit our ability to accurately diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if it’s really necessary. I suppose. It’s just… sounds unpleasant. Explain it to me, Doctor. Tell me what to expect. The more I know, maybe I won’t be so worried.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I want to make sure you feel comfortable. You'll lie on your side, usually your left side, with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricated, gloved finger to gently insert it into your rectum a short distance – no more than a couple of inches. This allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. I’ll be checking for any abnormalities, such as enlargement, tenderness, or unusual lumps. It might feel a little pressure or a mild sensation of needing to have a bowel movement, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll explain what I’m doing as I go, and we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. It’s a quick exam, usually less than a minute. Do you have any questions about that before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. It just… doesn’t sound very nice. But if you say it’s important, and you’ll explain everything… Alright, Doctor. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your trust, Mr. Hilber. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort during the exam. Okay, Mr. Hilber, I'm just going to start by feeling your abdomen. Now, I'm listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. And now, I'm going to proceed with the rectal exam. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright, Mr. Hilber, that concludes the physical exam. I did not feel any obvious abnormalities during the abdominal exam or auscultation. The rectal exam did reveal that your prostate is slightly enlarged, and it feels somewhat firm. This is not necessarily cause for alarm, as many men experience prostate enlargement with age, but it does warrant further investigation. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. A PSA test measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen in your blood, which can be elevated in certain prostate conditions. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A little enlarged… and firm… What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Should I be worried? What if it’s… bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber, and it's perfectly natural to be worried. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It means your prostate gland has grown larger, which can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like the ones you're experiencing – difficulty emptying your bladder, weak stream, and increased frequency. The fact that it feels somewhat firm is what leads me to want to do further testing. It could be due to inflammation, or it could be an early sign of something more serious, such as prostatitis or, less commonly, prostate cancer. However, it’s important to remember that an enlarged, firm prostate does not automatically mean you have cancer. That’s why we need to do the urine analysis and the PSA test to get a clearer picture. The urine analysis can help rule out infection, and the PSA test will give us a baseline measurement of your prostate-specific antigen. We’ll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. If the PSA level is elevated, we may consider a referral to a urologist for further evaluation, such as a prostate biopsy. But let’s not jump to conclusions right now. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: A biopsy… that sounds… scary. Is that painful? What if they find something bad? I don’t want to have to go through all that trouble. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Hilber. A biopsy can sound frightening, but let's focus on getting the information we need before we even think about that. The likelihood of needing a biopsy depends entirely on the results of the urine analysis and, most importantly, the PSA test. If your PSA level comes back normal, we may simply monitor your symptoms and discuss potential lifestyle modifications or medications to help manage them. If the level is elevated, a biopsy would be considered to determine the cause. If a biopsy is necessary, it involves taking a small sample of tissue from your prostate gland. It can be done in a few different ways, and we would discuss the best option for you. There can be some discomfort involved, but it is typically managed with local anesthesia and pain medication. There is also a small risk of complications, such as bleeding or infection, but these are rare. Right now, it’s premature to worry about all of that. Let's focus on getting the test results back and then we can make a plan together. We will address any concerns you have every step of the way. I will order these tests for you today. Do you have any questions about how or where these tests will be done?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. You want to check the tests first. And then decide what to do. The tests… will they call me if something’s wrong? And how long does that usually take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks and worrying about it.
DOCTOR: That's exactly right, Mr. Hilber. We will check the tests first. Your clinic has a patient portal that you can access online to review your results as soon as they become available. The clinic staff will also call you directly if any of the results require immediate attention. Typically, the urine analysis results are available within 24-48 hours. The PSA test usually takes 3-5 business days to come back. I will also personally follow up with you to discuss the results and answer any questions you may have. I’ll put a note in your chart to have someone call you to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week, regardless of the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, chills, or difficulty urinating completely, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about accessing the patient portal or how to contact the clinic?
PATIENT: No, I think I can manage that. I'll keep an eye on things. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, explaining everything. I still worry, of course… but I feel a little better knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help. It's perfectly natural to be worried, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get these tests done and figure out the best course of action together. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
