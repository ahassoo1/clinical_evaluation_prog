DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow, and it started after I ate some fava beans. It’s a long story, but that's when it really got bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is interesting. Tired and yellow… can you tell me a bit more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s just… a lot more than usual. I always have a little energy dip in the afternoons, but this is all day, every day. Like I haven’t slept in weeks, even when I have. It makes it hard to even get through work. And I feel weak, you know? Like I could just… fall over. It's really worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite debilitating. And you mentioned the yellowing – where are you noticing that?
PATIENT: Mostly my skin, I think. And the whites of my eyes… my daughter pointed it out. She said I looked… sick. I noticed it myself in the mirror, too. It's not super bright, but definitely noticeable. It really scared me when I saw it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said this seemed to start after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s what’s so odd. I had a big plate of them – my neighbour brought some over, they were from her garden, really fresh. A day or two later, I started feeling weak, and then the yellowing started. I haven’t eaten any since, and it hasn't gotten better, but it hasn’t gotten worse either. I’ve never had this happen before, and I’ve been eating fava beans for years!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a very important detail. Fava beans can sometimes be associated with a condition called G6PD deficiency, which can cause this kind of reaction. Let’s get some more information. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Maybe a little sniffle with pollen sometimes, but nothing serious enough to take medicine for. I haven’t tried any new foods recently, besides those beans.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to stay healthy with diet and exercise, so I don't really take anything. I might take a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that’s it. And it's not regular. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, you know. I had my appendix out when I was about 20, but that was years ago, and I recovered fine. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I go to the dentist regularly, though! Does that count?
DOCTOR: That does count! It's good to be proactive about your health. Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father had some problems with his heart when he got older. Nothing major that I know of, really. I don't think anyone else in the family had anything… serious, like what I'm describing. We weren't really a family that talked much about health problems. Everyone just… dealt with things. I wish I knew more now, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a receptionist at a small office – mostly answering phones and scheduling appointments. It's not very stressful. I live alone, but I have a daughter who lives nearby, so I see her often. I like to garden, when I have the energy, and I go for walks. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a good dessert now and then! I think I lead a pretty normal life, really. It’s just this… this whole thing with the beans is really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful information, Ms. Haggar. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and take a look at your skin and eyes more closely. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, that sounds fine, Doctor. No questions at all. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. I just want to know what's wrong and how to fix it. It's been making me so anxious, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. That's good. Now, let's check your abdomen. I'm going to gently press on your stomach to feel for any tenderness or enlargement. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness to report. Now, let's take a closer look at your skin and eyes. As you mentioned, you noticed some yellowing. I do see some mild jaundice, a yellowish discoloration of the skin and the whites of your eyes. It’s not severe, but it is present. Your skin feels warm and dry. Overall, your physical exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately alarming, but the jaundice is concerning given your history of eating fava beans. It's likely we need to investigate this further with some blood work. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood work is fine. I just want to know what's going on, so anything that can help is good. I'm a little nervous about it, but I trust you. What kind of blood work are we talking about? Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll need to run a complete blood count to check your red blood cell levels, and also a few liver function tests to see how your liver is doing. We’ll also do a test specifically for G6PD deficiency, which is an enzyme that's often low in people who have a reaction to fava beans. It’s a relatively simple blood draw, and the lab usually gets the results back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back to discuss them in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Scheduling a follow-up sounds best. I'd rather talk about it in person than over the phone if possible. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any foods I should avoid besides fava beans?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I’m glad I could help ease some of your anxiety. Let’s schedule you for a follow-up appointment on August 5th at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, August 5th at 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. And regarding what I should be doing in the meantime… anything specific?
DOCTOR: Okay, August 5th it is. In the meantime, avoid fava beans and any foods that might contain them. It's also best to avoid any medications known to cause liver issues – things like high-dose acetaminophen – until we know what’s going on. Stay well-hydrated, and get plenty of rest. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, dark urine, or confusion – please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just try to relax and take it easy. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that makes perfect sense. Avoid fava beans, certain medications, stay hydrated, rest, and watch for worsening symptoms. I’ve got it. Thank you again, Doctor Tosca. I really appreciate your time and care. I think that’s everything for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. It was my pleasure. I’ll see you on August 5th. Have a good day, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
PATIENT: Nice to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you again. I will call if needed. Have a good day as well!
