DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I haven’t got all day. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. And I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking them for years, and now this black business is going on. Is that what you need to know? Because if it is, let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Black stool is definitely something we need to look into. You mentioned the red pills for your arthritis – those are important to know about. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this black stool?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, it’s black. What more is there to say? It’s not…normal colored. It started, oh, a week ago maybe? Not much else has changed, really. I eat the same things, same biscuits with my tea every morning. I haven't been feeling sick or anything, just… this. Is it serious? Because I really don’t have time for anything complicated. My husband needs help with the garden, and I promised Mrs. Novotny I’d help her with the canning.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me all of that, Dawnetta. It is good to know there haven't been any other changes in how you're feeling, and that you’re so involved with helping others. Black stool can be caused by a number of things, some more concerning than others, so it’s good you brought it to my attention. Just to be thorough, when you say "black", is it a dark, tarry black, or more of a dark reddish-black?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Now you want me to be a color expert? It’s… dark. Like… well, like very strong coffee grounds. Not shiny, just…dark. I’m not a painter, doctor. I fix engines! And I really need to know if this is going to keep me from helping with the canning, because Mrs. Novotny relies on me. She's not getting any younger, you know. Is it the pills, then? Just tell me if it’s the pills.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the pills, and I apologize for asking you to be a "color expert." It’s a helpful detail, though – dark and tarry is good to know. Some medications can cause this, including some arthritis medications. However, it can also be a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract, which we want to rule out. To help me get a better picture of things, have you noticed any change in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Bleeding?! Oh, for goodness sake. Now you're talking about bleeding? I haven’t been feeling faint, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… tired, I suppose. But I’m 73 years old, doctor. I’m supposed to be tired! I’ve been running around helping everyone all week. It’s probably just that. Look, I don’t need a lot of tests if it's just old age. I’ve got things to do. Can’t you just prescribe something to fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I certainly don’t want to run unnecessary tests. However, because you've noticed a change in your stool, and because of your age, it's important to investigate a little further to make sure we aren't missing anything serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any issues with ulcers or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Heavens no. I eat sensible food! Biscuits, tea, a bit of roast chicken on Sundays… nothing fancy. My mother always said too much spice is the devil's work. No, never any stomach trouble. Except for a bit of heartburn sometimes after the biscuits, but that’s just… well, that’s just life. I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in years. Just the usual check-ups. Honestly, I think I’m wasting my time here. Is this going to be expensive? My Medicare…it doesn’t cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, and I can assure you we will only order tests that are necessary. We can also check with Medicare beforehand to get an idea of your coverage. Now, let's talk about those biscuits! I appreciate you telling me about your diet. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, even a small amount?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, I haven’t. If anything, I might have put on a little weight after Mrs. Novotny’s apple pie last month. Delicious, but probably not good for my figure. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, though. Why would I? I’m not a model, doctor. I need to get back to my husband. He’s terrible with the tomatoes. They need staking, you know, or they’ll just sprawl all over the garden. Is this going to take much longer? I really don’t understand why I have to answer all these questions. It's just black stool!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I apologize if I'm keeping you from your tomatoes. I'm asking these questions to get a complete picture of your health, so we can figure out the best course of action. Okay, so no weight loss. Now, just one more question about your past medical history. Have you ever had any issues with bleeding anywhere else?
PATIENT: Bleeding?! Honestly, doctor, are you accusing me of something? No! I haven’t been bleeding anywhere! Except for the occasional paper cut, but that’s hardly… Look, I think I'm done answering questions. This is ridiculous. It’s just a bit of black stool. Can’t you just give me something for it and let me go? I have a garden to help with, canning to do, and a husband who can’t tell a tomato plant from a weed. I’m wasting my time here! .
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta, I understand. I'm sorry if my questions feel intrusive, and I certainly don’t mean to upset you. Given your concerns, I can see you’re very anxious to get back home. However, I am concerned enough about the black stool that I do recommend we do a simple blood test to check your iron levels and rule out any significant bleeding. Would you be willing to do that?
