DOCTOR: Bula and good day, Arbie. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… business. Down there. I noticed some… red in the bowl, if you catch my drift. Not something a man my age needs to be dealing with, I can tell you that. And frankly, I haven’t got all day to sit here discussing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've noticed some blood in your stool, and you're understandably concerned. We’ll try to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can. When you say “noticed some red”, can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was red! Like… blood is red. Honestly, are you new to this? Bright red, mostly. Sometimes a bit darker, like… well, you know. It's not like I'm painting pictures here. And it’s unsettling, that’s what it is. A man shouldn’t be seeing that.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Bright red, sometimes darker. And it’s unsettling, you’re right to be concerned. That helps. Now, is the blood mixed in with the stool, or is it separate?
PATIENT: Separate, mostly. Like… drops. Or streaks. Not all mixed up, thank goodness. I wouldn't be sitting here if it was mixed. That sounds… unpleasant. Really unpleasant. Though, to be honest, any of this is unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, separate drops or streaks of bright red blood. Good to know. And has this happened before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: New. Definitely new. I’ve… had a few troubles over the years, you understand, but this hasn’t happened before. Not like this. I’m usually regular as clockwork, and then suddenly… this. It’s worrying, I tell you. Worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new symptom for you, and you’re usually regular. Alright. And about how long ago did you first notice this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I was having my usual breakfast – toast and tea – and that’s when I saw it. Tuesday. So, it’s been… three days now? Give or take. Time flies when you’re getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits other than the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… it’s been a bit… looser, I suppose. Not full-blown watery, thankfully. Just… not as solid as usual. And I’ve been going… more often. A bit of a nuisance, really. I like routine, you understand. This is all very disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools and more frequent bowel movements along with the blood. And have you had any stomach pain, cramping, or any feeling of needing to go urgently?
PATIENT: No cramping, thankfully. And no urgent feelings. Just… a bit of discomfort. A dull ache, mostly, lower down. Nothing too bad, but enough to notice. It's more the sight of the… red that's bothering me, to be honest. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Alright, no cramping, just a dull ache lower down. And the sight of the blood is concerning. I understand. Now, have you noticed any fatigue or weakness lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Well, I am 88 years old, doctor. I'm allowed to be a bit tired! But… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more… drained than usual. Not enough to stop me from my usual… puttering about, but certainly not as sprightly as I was. And I haven’t been sleeping as well either. Thinking about all this, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and trouble sleeping. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent changes in your appetite, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Appetite's been… normal, I suppose. Still enjoy my toast and tea, and a bit of fish now and then. Weight… well, I haven’t been weighing myself. Don’t really see the point at my age. If I’ve lost a pound or two, it wouldn’t bother me. Probably for the best, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my arthritis, now and then. Nothing regular. And allergies… not that I know of. I’ve lived a long life, doctor. If I was allergic to something, I’d know about it by now. Though, I do find some of those newfangled soaps a bit irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, just something for arthritis occasionally, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your tummy, and then do a gentle abdominal exam. It will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. Get it over with, then. I haven’t got all day. Though I warn you, I bruise easily. Don't go poking around too much. And try not to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be very gentle. I'll listen to your abdomen first, then just a gentle press to feel for any tenderness. Okay, breathing normally. Sounds good. Now, I'm just going to press here… and here… Any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: A little… yes, a little tenderness there, on the left side. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And a bit here too. Honestly, doctor, I'm not surprised. It's all rather unsettling, poking around like that. I prefer to leave things alone, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness on the left side and a bit elsewhere. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it’s good we're investigating this. Blood in the stool, even if it’s separate, can be caused by a number of things, from something relatively minor like hemorrhoids or a small anal fissure, to something more serious. Because you're also experiencing changes in bowel habits, fatigue, and some tenderness, I'd like to order a few tests just to be sure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More poking and prodding? I suppose if you think it's necessary. Though I warn you, I don’t do well with all these modern contraptions. And I haven’t got insurance, you know. I can't afford a fortune. What sort of tests are we talking about?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the tests themselves. We'll try to keep things as simple as possible. I'd like to order a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia, which can sometimes be caused by bleeding. And a Fecal Occult Blood Test to confirm there's blood in your stool and rule out other causes. We can also do a simple chemical stool test to rule out infection. Those are the basics. Depending on the results of those, we might need to consider a colonoscopy, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I'll check what the costs are upfront and discuss them with you before proceeding with anything. I'll also see if there are any programs available to help with the cost, given your lack of insurance. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. A colonoscopy… now there's a thought. No, absolutely not. Not unless you have a very, very good reason. And if you must poke and prod, at least tell me what all these… tests are for. I don't like surprises. And yes, please do find out about the cost. I haven't got money to burn, you know. Alright, alright, let's get it over with. But no colonoscopy. Understand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no colonoscopy unless absolutely necessary, and we’ll discuss everything thoroughly before proceeding with any test. I understand your concerns completely. The CBC, or Complete Blood Count, will tell us if you’re anemic, which means if you’re low on red blood cells. Bleeding, even a little bit over time, can cause that. The Fecal Occult Blood Test, or FOBT, is a simple test to confirm the presence of blood in your stool. Sometimes it's not visible, but this test can detect it. It also helps us rule out other possible causes. And the chemical stool test checks for any infections. I’m just putting in the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll give you instructions on how to collect the samples. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… complicated. But if you say it’s necessary, I suppose. Just get it over with quickly. And please, no surprises. And remind me again, how do I collect these… samples? I don't want to make a mess. Honestly, this is all very undignified for a man of my age.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Arbie, and I'll do my best to make it as easy and dignified as possible. Here are the instructions for the stool sample collection. It’s pretty straightforward. You'll receive a collection kit from the lab. There are specific instructions on how to collect a small sample after a normal bowel movement. You’ll need to avoid certain foods and medications for a few days beforehand – the instructions detail those. It is important to collect three separate samples on three different days for accurate results. The kit comes with a container to store the samples and instructions on how to bring them back to the lab. The lab staff will guide you through the process if you have any questions. They'll also explain how the results will be sent to me. Do you have any questions about the instructions right now, or would you prefer to ask the lab staff directly?
PATIENT: Hmph. Three separate samples… honestly. It’s a nuisance, but alright. Let me see these… instructions. Avoid red meat and aspirin… sounds reasonable. And I need to keep it separate from… everything else. Honestly, it’s a bit of a bother. I suppose I can manage. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. I’ll probably need the lab staff to explain it to me in more detail. They sound more… practical. Just get me back to my toast and tea as soon as possible, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbie. I understand. The lab staff is excellent, and they’ll guide you through everything. Here's a referral slip for the lab. It’s located just down the hall, Room 203. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week to discuss the results once they're available. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week… alright. A week sounds… acceptable. As long as it doesn't drag on. And you’ll contact me if anything urgent comes up? I don’t want to be left in the dark. Alright. Let’s get this over with. Thank you, doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arbie. I’ll contact you immediately if anything urgent comes up. And you can always call the clinic if you have any concerns. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for next Thursday at 2:00 PM. I hope you feel better soon, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. Good day, doctor. I'll be off then. Let's hope it's nothing serious. .
