DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall, welcome. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, my daughter, she is thinking about having a baby. And someone said I should… come here? Before… before it happens. It’s a little confusing, to be honest. I don’t really… know what I need to do. Just… help, I guess. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So, pre-conception counseling, is what you're after. It’s… good your daughter is thinking ahead, some people don’t bother. It's… sensible. Though, honestly, it's usually her who comes in, not… well, nevermind. Let's start with you, Mr. Verrall. You said 'before it happens'. Are you and your daughter planning… a close relationship with this baby?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Yes, I… I want to help. She wants me to be… involved. She asked me to come with her to… to see about things. I live with her, you see. And the baby will… live with us too. I just… I’m older. I don’t want to… cause trouble. I want everything to be… okay. Is that making sense? I don’t remember much these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Involved… living arrangement. Good to know. And you're concerned about your age. Sensible, again. We need to make sure you're healthy enough for… this arrangement. Let’s start with some basics then. Do you have any medical problems at all?
PATIENT: Medical problems… hmm. Let me think. I used to have trouble with my back, a long time ago. And my knees, they ache sometimes. Especially when it rains. I see a doctor sometimes, for… for aches. But nothing serious, I don't think. I forget the name of the doctor, though. And what he said. It’s all a bit… fuzzy. Does that make sense? I take some pills… for the pain. Little white ones, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. Back pain, knees, pain medication. “Little white ones” isn't terribly helpful, Mr. Verrall, but we’ll get there. Do you know what those pills are for, specifically?
PATIENT: No, not really. My daughter, she gets them for me. She tells me to take them when it hurts. I… I just take them. She's a good girl, very organized. I don’t like to bother her with questions, she’s busy. I suppose it’s for the pain, like I said. Is it… important what they are? I don’t want to cause any trouble. Maybe I should write down the name next time.
DOCTOR: It's… crucial, Mr. Verrall. Crucial. We need to know what medications you’re taking. It can affect… everything. Alright. Let's try this differently. Have you had any surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I think… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. And… maybe my appendix? But I’m not sure. It was a very long time ago. And my daughter… she always handles these things. I don’t remember details. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Tonsils, possible appendix. Right. Alright. Any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… I had a bad cough, once. A very bad cough. I was in bed for a long time. But that was… years and years ago. And… I don’t think it was serious. It just… felt bad. I can’t remember what the doctor said. Is this important for the baby? I worry about her, you know.
DOCTOR: It's… all important, Mr. Verrall. Everything contributes. Let’s try family history then. Are there any illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…? You mean… my parents? My brothers and sisters? Well… my mother, she lived to be a very old age. A very, very old age. But I don’t know if she had any… illnesses. She was always strong. And my father… he died young, I think. But I don’t remember what he died from. It was a long time ago. We didn’t… talk about these things much. Is this important for the baby? Should I ask my daughter? She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's important, Mr. Verrall. Although, frankly, getting a clear history from you is proving… difficult. Alright. Social history then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. No, I don't smoke. Never have. It's bad for you, you know. My wife, she… she didn’t like it. She always said it was bad for you. I haven't smoked since… well, since she passed away. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I drink a little wine, sometimes. With dinner. A glass, maybe two. Nothing much. My daughter, she… she doesn’t like it when I drink too much. She worries about me. I don’t get drunk, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… relax a little.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Verrall. It's… clear you have a limited recall of your medical history. And, frankly, relying on your daughter for all this information is… less than ideal. Given your age, and the potential for… complications, I strongly recommend a thorough physical exam and some bloodwork. Just to get a baseline. We need to know what we’re working with. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. If it will help the baby… and my daughter. Yes. That sounds very sensible. Bloodwork… and an exam. Whatever you need. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then we’ll move to a basic physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes. It won’t be anything strenuous. And then we’ll get some blood drawn. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never had any problems with… with anything. But… my daughter always tells the doctors if I have any allergies. She's very careful. I'm sorry, I really wish I could be more helpful. But I just don't remember things very well these days. Is it okay if my daughter comes in? She can… answer the questions, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That... would be preferable, Mr. Verrall. Frankly, this is proving... difficult. Please have her come in when you’re ready. I'll have the nurse prepare the exam room.
