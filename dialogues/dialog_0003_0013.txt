DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's... it's my water. I have trouble getting it all out, you see. Feels like it's stuck sometimes. It's been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not every time, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Complete... emptying. That's a good way to put it. It just… doesn’t all come out at once, if you know what I mean. I have to… push a little, sometimes go back a second time. It's embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how frequently would you say this is occurring?
PATIENT: Well, not every time I go. Maybe… three or four times a week? Some days it’s fine, and other days… like today, it takes a bit of effort. It’s hard to say exactly. It doesn't hurt, just… incomplete. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Three to four times a week of incomplete emptying. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: The stream…? You mean… how it comes out? No, not really. It seems about the same as always. Not weak or anything. Just… the amount left behind, you see? It’s not the flow that’s the problem, it’s what's left after the flow. I hope that makes sense. I'm not good with explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We’re attempting to pinpoint the issue, Mr. Hilber. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your lower abdomen, back, or side?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. And no pain, not at all. That’s what's so confusing! It’s just… this feeling of not being completely empty. I don’t feel sick, just… inconvenienced, I guess. It’s a bit worrying, though, not knowing what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any increased frequency of urination, or a sense of urgency—feeling like you have to go right away?
PATIENT: No, not really. I go about the same number of times a day as always, I think. And no, I don't have that feeling of needing to rush. It’s not like that. It just… takes a little longer, sometimes, to get everything out. I don't feel a strong urge, just… a lingering feeling afterward. Does that help? I’m trying to be as clear as I can.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, thank you. Now, let's move on. Any history of diabetes, prostate problems, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, never been told I have that. Prostate problems… no, not that I know of. Doctor, I'm a bit of a simple man, if you understand. I don’t go to doctors much. Neurological… what does that mean? I'm sorry, I don't know a lot of these fancy words.
DOCTOR: Neurological conditions refer to problems with your nerves—specifically, those controlling the bladder. Never mind. We can skip that for now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't take any pills, not even aspirin. I try to stay healthy, eat my fish and berries. I don’t believe in taking a lot of medicine unless I really have to. Just… worried about this water problem. Is it something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say at this point without a proper examination. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will involve checking your abdomen and a brief neurological assessment. Then, we’ll likely need to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. A physical exam and a test of my water. Yes, that sounds good. I trust your judgement. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this figured out. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to begin by palpating your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just relax, Mr. Hilber. Any pain or discomfort during this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. It's… a little strange, but no pain. It feels like you're just… pressing. Not uncomfortable, just… aware of it. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to a doctor. I hope everything’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just listening to the sounds in your abdomen now. Sounds normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs straight and relaxed. Normal reflexes. No obvious neurological deficits detected. Now, we will need to obtain a urine sample for analysis. I’ll leave you with a collection cup and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if possible.
PATIENT: A midstream sample… what does that mean exactly, Doctor? I'm not sure I understand. Is there a special way I need to… do it? I want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: Here. This pamphlet illustrates the procedure. Essentially, start urinating into the cup, then collect the sample midstream—after the initial flow has passed. This ensures a cleaner sample. If you have any difficulties, the nurse will be happy to assist you. Once you’ve collected the sample, please bring it to the lab window. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. Start and then… get some in the middle. A midstream sample. Alright. I’ll try my best. Thank you for explaining it. I'll go do that now, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hilber. Please do. I will be in my office reviewing other patients’ charts. The nurse will let me know when your sample is ready. We’ll discuss the results and determine the next course of action then. .
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll go do that now.
