DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Bakan. It’s… satisfactory to meet you as well. I am here because my husband, he insists I get one of those… forms. An advance directive, he called it? Or a POLST? Honestly, I don’t quite understand why I need such a thing. I am perfectly healthy, thank you very much. But he worries. He always worries.
DOCTOR: It's quite common for spouses to encourage these important conversations, Marija. It’s thoughtful of your husband to prompt you to consider an advance directive, or POLST form as you mentioned. These documents aren’t about anticipating illness, necessarily, but rather about ensuring your wishes are known should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. To clarify, an advance directive is a broader document outlining your overall healthcare preferences, while a POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a specific medical order, typically for those with a serious illness or frailty. Perhaps we can discuss what’s important to you regarding your healthcare, and I can help you determine if either of these documents is appropriate at this time. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: That sounds… rather involved. I assure you, Doctor, I have very clear ideas about my healthcare. I expect the best possible care, naturally. And I expect to be listened to. I simply don't see the need to write everything down. It seems… pessimistic, and frankly, a waste of my time. But if you insist, I suppose we can discuss it briefly. However, I am a busy woman, and I do have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your reservations completely, Marija. It is a rather sensitive topic, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel it’s unnecessary at this time. I assure you, it's not about anticipating a negative outcome, but empowering you to maintain control of your care, even in unforeseen circumstances. To begin, perhaps we can simply discuss what a typical healthcare scenario would look like for you if you were unable to speak for yourself. For example, if you were seriously ill and required a breathing machine, or a feeding tube, what would your preferences be?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. A breathing machine? A feeding tube? These are dreadful things to contemplate. I would, of course, want everything done. Everything. I expect modern medicine to… prevail. I do not understand this desire to… limit care. My mother always said, fight until the very end. And I intend to do just that. I would not want anyone interfering with my treatment, even if I were… incapacitated. It's simply barbaric to suggest otherwise. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that is very clear. You have a strong preference for pursuing all available life-sustaining treatments, and a desire to avoid any limitations on your care. I appreciate you sharing that with me so candidly. Just to ensure I fully understand, and for documentation purposes, would it be accurate to say that you would want full code status initiated in the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest?
PATIENT: “Full code status”? Is that… medical jargon? Honestly, Doctor, I am not a physician. You must speak plainly. If you mean… do everything possible to keep me alive, then yes. Absolutely. Do everything. I pay good money for your expertise, and I expect you to utilize it to its fullest extent. I do not understand why this requires so much… discussion. It seems rather obvious, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask me to clarify, Marija. I apologize for using medical terminology without explaining it. “Full code” means that if your heart were to stop beating or you were to stop breathing, we would initiate all resuscitative measures, including chest compressions, medications, and potentially intubation to support your breathing. So, to confirm, you would want us to perform all of these interventions if such a situation were to arise?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is precisely what I want. All of it. I have made myself perfectly clear, have I not? Frankly, I find this entire conversation rather… insulting. As if I haven’t thought this through. My husband is the one who worries needlessly. I am a rational woman, and I want to live. Do everything possible to ensure that happens. Now, are we finished? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we are finished. I apologize if the conversation felt unnecessarily lengthy or intrusive. I assure you, my intention was solely to ensure your wishes are clearly documented and respected. Based on our discussion, I will document your preference for full code status and a desire for all life-sustaining treatments. We can also note your strong preference against any limitations on your care. I understand you have a luncheon appointment, and I won’t detain you any further. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. I trust you will record everything accurately. And please, refrain from using such… complicated language in the future. It’s quite unnecessary. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I will ensure your wishes are documented clearly and concisely. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a pleasant afternoon. .
