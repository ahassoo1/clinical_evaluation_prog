DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it’s gotten worse recently. I apologize, I don't recall exactly when it started, but I do know it's concerning.
DOCTOR: Unsteady, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s not a constant thing, but… sometimes when I’m walking, or even just standing, I feel like the room is tilting, or I’m the one tilting. It’s quite unsettling, truly. I work on oil rigs, you see, so… balance is rather important. I don't want to risk an accident.
DOCTOR: Oil rigs, yes. Well, that is concerning. It's good you're taking this seriously. “Tilting,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, tilting. It’s hard to describe… not like spinning, exactly. More like… the floor isn’t quite level, even when I know it is. And sometimes, my vision feels a little… fuzzy when it happens. It doesn't last long, thankfully, but it's enough to make me pause and hold onto something. I… do you understand what I mean? It's difficult to put into words.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy vision with the tilting… alright. And how often would you say this happens, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky question. It’s not every day, certainly. Perhaps… a few times a week? It’s hard to keep track, I must admit. Things… haven’t been easy, and my memory isn’t what it once was. But it’s definitely been more frequent lately, especially when I’m tired after a long shift. I don't want to be a bother, but I'm worried this is getting worse.
DOCTOR: "Not every day," but increasing with fatigue... right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness and fuzzy vision?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I’ve been rather tired, as I mentioned. More tired than usual, even for my job. And sometimes I get a bit of a headache, a dull ache at the back of my head. I also… I haven’t been eating as well as I should, I suppose. Work is demanding, and I often skip meals. I'm unsure if that contributes, but it feels relevant. I… I don’t believe so, otherwise. Nothing else springs to mind immediately.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, headaches, and decreased appetite… alright. Now, Ms. Snerling, have you had any previous medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s… a difficult question. My husband… he always handled those things. I… I know I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. He passed away about a year ago, and everything became rather… blurry. I have private insurance, though, if that helps. I believe I saw a doctor for a check-up shortly after… but I don't recall specifics. I apologize. I'm trying my best to remember, but it's… difficult.
DOCTOR: A year ago… alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries that I recall. Nothing of that nature. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. It’s just… this unsteadiness is worrying me, especially with my job. It’s rather dangerous, being on an oil rig when you can't trust your balance. I… I'm unsure if this is relevant, but I occasionally feel a bit lightheaded when I stand up quickly. It doesn't happen often, but it's worth mentioning, I presume?
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness… yes, worth mentioning. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother is still living, she’s in Ethiopia. I haven’t seen her in several years, sadly. She’s generally healthy, as far as I know. My father passed away when I was young. I don’t recall any significant medical issues on either side of the family, honestly. No history of dizziness or balance problems, that I'm aware of. I apologize for my vagueness; it's frustrating to not be more helpful. Everything feels… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. I occasionally use ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I… I try to avoid taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies when I can, but the ibuprofen hasn’t been helping much lately, truthfully. It barely touches the ache at the back of my head.
DOCTOR: No medications… alright. Now, let’s do a quick examination. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here I am. Please let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I… I might need to hold onto something. It's just a precaution.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just stand still for a moment. I'm going to check your balance. Now, close your eyes. Hmm. A bit unsteady, even with support. Now, open your eyes. Can you follow my finger with your gaze without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. It’s… a little difficult. It feels strange, trying to isolate my eyes like this. I feel a slight wobble… is that normal? I'm doing my best to keep my head still, Doctor. I… I hope I'm not making this difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Blood pressure is 120/80. Pulse is 72. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your ears. Ears appear normal. Hmm. It doesn't seem to be anything obvious, Ms. Snerling.
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… relieving, in a way, but also concerning, if that makes sense? If there’s nothing obviously wrong, what could be causing this unsteadiness? I… I apologize for being so anxious, Doctor. I just want to be sure I can safely return to work. It’s… important to me. Is there anything else you’d like to check? Perhaps a blood test? I'm willing to do whatever it takes to find out what's going on.
DOCTOR: It could be several things, Ms. Snerling. Given your fatigue and decreased appetite, we should rule out some basic vitamin deficiencies, especially Vitamin D and B12. A complete blood count and metabolic panel would be prudent. And yes, a Vitamin D and B12 level. We'll also check your thyroid function. That can sometimes cause these symptoms. I'll order those tests for you now. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking this seriously. When will I be able to get the results? And… will I need to come back for another appointment afterwards? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I want to understand what’s happening, and what I need to do. I… I hope it doesn't take too long, as I need to return to work soon.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes a few days, Ms. Snerling. I'll have the nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. And yes, you'll need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We'll go over everything then and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to get some rest and eat a balanced diet. I know that’s easier said than done, but it can make a difference. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for your time and patience. I appreciate you listening to my concerns. I’ll wait for the nurse to contact me regarding the lab results. And I will… try to get more rest and eat better, as you suggested. Thank you again, Doctor Kur.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Ms. Snerling. The nurse will be in touch.
PATIENT: .
