DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Bombara. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels… tight, like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Chest pain is certainly something we want to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about this tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay. It usually happens when I’m walking. Not fast walking, just… regular. Like when I go to the market, maybe two, three blocks. It goes away when I stop and rest for a bit. It doesn't go all the way up to my neck or arm, if that makes sense. Just… in the middle of my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it seems related to exertion, and it’s localized to the center of your chest. Does it feel like a pressure, a burning, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: It's… more like a squeezing, like I said. And heavy. It's a heavy squeeze. Not a sharp pain, you understand? And it makes me a little breathless sometimes, when it happens. Not very breathless, just… I have to take a few deeper breaths. My husband, he worries, of course. He says I should come right away.
DOCTOR: It's good your husband is looking out for you. Breathlessness with chest discomfort is always something we need to take seriously. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a new development?
PATIENT: It started… maybe a month ago? At first, it was just once or twice, and I thought maybe I just walked too fast. But it’s been happening more often this last week. Maybe three or four times a week now. And it seems to last a little longer each time. It's worrying me, you know? I don't like feeling like I have to stop when I'm walking. I like to walk!
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual increase in frequency and duration is definitely something we should look into. Let's get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees. The doctor gave me some cream for it, and it helps. And my blood pressure… it’s sometimes a little high, but I take a pill for that every morning. It's a small, white pill. The doctor says it keeps it under control. Otherwise, I think I’m pretty healthy! I try to eat good food, you know? Lots of vegetables. My husband grows them!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And you mentioned a pill for your blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. I'm terrible with names. Let me see… the bottle is at home. It’s a little blue bottle. I think… it starts with an “A”? No, maybe a “V”? I really can’t remember, Doctor. I just take it every morning like the doctor told me. My husband, he handles the refills. He knows all the names.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can look it up with your insurance information. No need to worry about that right now. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine, not that I can remember. I had penicillin when I was a little girl, a long time ago, and I was fine. But I haven't taken much medicine since then, except for the blood pressure pill and the cream for my knees. Mostly just tea with lemon when I have a cold!
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, a very long time ago. And… oh! I broke my wrist when I was young, but that was a long time ago too. Other than that… no. I haven't been in the hospital for anything else. I try to stay out of hospitals, you know? They aren't a very nice place.
DOCTOR: I agree, hospitals are best avoided when possible. Now, thinking about your family… are there any heart problems or other serious illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh yes. My father… he had a bad heart. He had chest pains a lot, and he had to have a… a procedure done, a long time ago. I don’t know what it was called. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had high blood pressure too, just like me. She took pills for it her whole life. Other than that… not that I can remember. My mother, she lived a long time and she was very healthy! She walked every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. Finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like smoking. My mother never smoked, and my husband doesn’t smoke either. It’s a bad habit, you know? Makes you cough and smell bad. I like fresh air!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. That’s very good. Alright, Sherion, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s going on with my chest. It's a little scary, you know? But I trust you.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s scary, and we'll do our best to figure it out. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. And I can hear a slight murmur when listening to your heart. Your lungs sound clear, but your heart rate is a little fast. I'm going to order an EKG and some blood work, just to get a better look at things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… elevated? And a murmur? That doesn’t sound good, does it? An EKG… and blood work? Is it… serious, Doctor? I’m getting a little worried now. My husband is going to be very concerned.
DOCTOR: It's natural to be worried, Sherion. Let me explain. Elevated blood pressure means your heart is working a little harder than it should. And a murmur… sometimes murmurs are harmless, and sometimes they can indicate a problem with the heart valves. The EKG will help us see if there are any irregularities in your heart rhythm, and the blood work will give us more information about your overall health. These tests are just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, and they don't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We'll get these tests done quickly, and I'll explain the results to you as soon as I have them. I want to rule out anything serious, and then we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds like a lot. I… I suppose not. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? The blood work, I mean. I'm not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: The blood work is just a simple draw from your arm. It won't take long, maybe five minutes at most. And it shouldn't be too painful, just a quick pinch. The lab technician is very skilled. As for the EKG, that's completely painless. We just attach some small stickers to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It only takes a few minutes. The results usually come back within a couple of days. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain that’s severe or doesn’t go away, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Emergency room if it’s bad… a couple of days for the results… okay. And the stickers don’t hurt? That’s good. My husband will be glad to hear that. He worries so much. Okay. So… I just go to the lab and they do the blood work, and then I wait for your call? It's not a long wait, you said? And you'll explain everything to me, right? I don't understand all those medical words.
DOCTOR: Exactly. You’ll go to the lab, they’ll draw a little bit of blood, and then you wait for my call. It shouldn’t be more than a couple of days, but I’ll have the nurses contact you if there are any delays. And yes, absolutely. I’ll explain everything to you in plain language. I don’t want you to worry about understanding medical jargon. If I use any terms you don’t understand, please stop me and ask me to explain them. That’s what I’m here for. Do you have any questions about where the lab is located, or how to schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: No… I think I can find it. It’s not far from the market, right? I usually go to the market on Tuesdays… yes, I think I can manage. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I was so worried, but you’ve made me feel a little bit better. I’ll go to the lab and wait for your call. And if anything happens… I’ll go to the emergency room. Okay. I think that’s all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, if you experience any concerning symptoms, don’t wait – go to the emergency room. I’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
