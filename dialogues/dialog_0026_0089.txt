DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Oh dear… what did bring me in? It’s… it’s been a bit of a blur lately, to be honest. Something about… pain. Down low. In my stomach, I believe? And… something about a condition I have. It starts with an ‘S’… Lupus, perhaps? It’s awfully difficult to keep track of these things. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Alese. It's perfectly alright. Memory can be tricky. So, you're experiencing some pain in your lower abdomen, and you suspect it might be related to Lupus?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. It comes and goes, you see. Not constant, thankfully. But when it does come… it’s quite severe. A cramping sort of pain, mostly. And… a feeling of fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s been… worrying me a bit, naturally. I haven’t been able to pinpoint anything that makes it better or worse, which is… frustrating. Do you need me to… describe it in more detail? I’m afraid I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a good start, Alese. It’s helpful to know it's cramping and comes and goes, and that you experience a feeling of fullness. It’s alright if details are hard to come by; we'll take it slow. Could you tell me a little more about when this pain started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? Let me think… It feels… recent, but not terribly so. Perhaps… a few weeks ago? Maybe a month? It’s difficult to say precisely. It began gradually, I believe. At first, it was just a slight discomfort, easily dismissed. Then, it slowly worsened. I thought it might be something I ate, at first. But it didn’t go away, even with… careful eating. I’m so sorry I can’t be more precise. Dates have never been my strong suit.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. A few weeks to a month is still helpful. It sounds like it progressed gradually, which is good to know. And you've already ruled out dietary causes, which is excellent self-awareness. Now, has this pain been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see… I’ve been… rather tired, I suppose. More tired than usual, even for me. And… a bit of bloating, I think. Though that could just be the pain, couldn’t it? Oh, and… I have noticed some… changes in my bathroom habits, if you don’t mind me saying so. Not… regular, let’s put it that way. A bit… unpredictable. Is that… helpful? I feel rather like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Alese, please don’t apologize for rambling. Fatigue, bloating, and changes in your bowel habits are all important things to note. When you say “unpredictable”, could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… sometimes I feel the need to go quite frequently, other times… not at all. And when I do go… it’s often… loose. Not always, mind you. But more often than I’d like. And… there’s been a little bit of… discomfort afterwards. A sort of burning sensation, if you understand. It’s not terribly painful, but… noticeable. I’m terribly sorry to be so… graphic. I’m not usually this… detailed.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Alese. It’s important for me to have a complete picture, and you’re providing me with valuable information. It sounds like you're experiencing some changes in bowel frequency and consistency, with occasional burning afterward. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… as I mentioned earlier, I have… Lupus. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, to be precise. It’s been… a lifelong companion, I suppose. Diagnosed many years ago. And… I believe I also have some… arthritis? Perhaps rheumatoid arthritis? It’s all a bit of a blur, as you can imagine. I see a rheumatologist regularly, but… I haven't been seen for a few months now. I’ve also had… a bout of diverticulitis a few years ago, but it hasn't troubled me recently.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alese. That’s very helpful. So, Lupus is your primary diagnosis, and you’ve had some previous issues with diverticulitis. It's good to know you're being followed by a rheumatologist, even if it's been a few months since your last appointment. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… Oh! Yes, actually. Many years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. It was… quite unpleasant, but I recovered well. And… I believe I had a hysterectomy as well, quite some time ago. I was… younger then. And… oh dear, I'm afraid that's all I can recall at the moment. My memory is… terribly unreliable, you see. I apologize for the gaps.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. We're getting a good picture here. Cholecystectomy and hysterectomy are noted. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult one. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? It was quite debilitating for her. And… my sister had some… heart problems, I think. Nothing too serious, but she had to have… a pacemaker fitted. And… my grandfather had… diabetes, I believe. Type 2, perhaps? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. My family wasn’t terribly forthcoming about medical matters, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alese. That’s helpful to know. Arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes in the family. It’s alright that it’s hazy; we’ll proceed with what we have. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. I don’t believe so. I've never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. I am… a little sensitive to certain antibiotics, perhaps? They sometimes upset my stomach, but it’s nothing serious. And… I have a slight aversion to shellfish, but that’s more of a… preference than an allergy, I think. I don’t particularly enjoy the taste.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible antibiotic sensitivity, and a preference against shellfish. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take… Plaquenil, for my Lupus, of course. And… a low dose of aspirin, to help with my heart health. And… occasionally, I take some ibuprofen for… aches and pains, but not very often. And… oh! And I take a Vitamin D supplement, as my levels were a bit low last time I had my blood work done. I believe that’s all. I apologize if I’m forgetting anything. My medication list… tends to be rather chaotic.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alese. That’s a very helpful list. Alright, now I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and a few other routine checks. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Please, proceed at your own pace. I’m rather… relaxed, you see. Not feeling any particular pressure. Just… let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I trust your judgment entirely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds… normal, within expected limits. No murmurs, wheezes, or crackles that are concerning. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort here, on your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, there is a bit of tenderness. Right… about here. It’s not… excruciating, but definitely noticeable when you press. And… it feels… a little bit deeper than just the surface. A sort of… aching sensation. It’s more pronounced when I’m… tense, I believe. Perhaps that’s why it wasn’t immediately obvious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese. I’m noting some tenderness in your lower left abdomen. It doesn't feel like there's a distinct mass, but it is definitely deeper than surface discomfort, as you mentioned. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They sound… normal. Active, but no unusual gurgling or silence. Alright, well, that concludes the abdominal exam. Everything else appears within normal limits. Based on what you've told me and my examination, it sounds like we have a few possibilities to consider. Given your history of Lupus, your reported symptoms, and the tenderness in your lower abdomen, we need to investigate further. Would you be willing to consider some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… entirely reasonable, Doctor. Blood work would be… a good idea, I think. Anything that might help pinpoint the cause of this discomfort would be… most welcome. I trust your judgment entirely. I’m not particularly fond of needles, but… I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese. It's good to hear. We'll just need a routine blood draw. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an inflammatory marker such as C-reactive protein and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, and a basic urine analysis. These tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your current medications as prescribed. If your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t believe so, Doctor. You’ve been… exceptionally thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the lab to contact me. And… try to remain calm in the meantime. Thank you for your time and… consideration. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing that we’re taking steps to address this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. It was my pleasure. I understand it can be unsettling when you’re experiencing unexplained symptoms, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any further concerns. Have a good day, Alese. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Finco. You as well. I… appreciate your kindness. .
