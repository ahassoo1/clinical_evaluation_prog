DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, state the reason for your visit today, and try to be concise. My schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um, well, it’s my stomach. It’s been… not good. Lots of diarrhea, for a while now. It's been on and off, but mostly on lately. I… honestly, I can’t really remember exactly when it started, but it feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: “A long time” is not particularly helpful, Ms. Nahrwold. We are attempting to establish a timeline here. Can you perhaps narrow it down?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Um… maybe a few months? It feels like it started around… spring, maybe? Or was it before that? I really don’t know. It's just been… happening. I’ve had problems like this before, though. My… someone told me it was something with how my body handles food? I think? It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: “Problems like this before.” And were these “problems” ever formally investigated?
PATIENT: Investigated? Um… I think so? A long time ago. I had some tests, I remember that. They took… blood, and I had to, you know, give samples. But what they found… I really don’t recall. It was years ago, and honestly, my memory isn’t the best. My husband usually handles all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can't rely on vague recollections, Ms. Nahrwold. We need concrete information. Let’s start with the current issue. Aside from the diarrhea, are you experiencing any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Pain, definitely. It's not… sharp, exactly. More like cramping? And it kind of comes and goes. It’s worse after I… eat, I think. And sometimes I feel really bloated. Like I’m going to burst. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Bloating and cramping. And what, specifically, are you eating when these symptoms occur?
PATIENT: Um… everything, really? That’s the frustrating part. It doesn’t seem to be one specific thing. Like, I had a sandwich yesterday and was fine. Then today, I had… rice, I think, and it was bad. Maybe it’s something spicy? I do like a bit of heat, but I haven't had anything really spicy recently. Honestly, I'm trying to figure it out myself. I’ve just been avoiding things, but I'm getting a bit worried.
DOCTOR: Avoiding things is not a diagnosis, Ms. Nahrwold. It simply delays the inevitable. Now, let’s move on. Are you experiencing any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside these… digestive disturbances?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And… sometimes I feel a bit queasy, but I haven't actually been sick. No vomiting, thankfully. Just… the diarrhea and the cramping. And the bloating, like I said. It's just… really uncomfortable. It’s been disrupting things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is… distended, as you mentioned. Bowel sounds… present, though somewhat hyperactive. Anything else you’ve neglected to mention?
PATIENT: Um… oh! I keep having to go to the bathroom. A lot. Like, way more than usual, even for the diarrhea. It’s really tiring, honestly. And… sometimes I feel a bit weak. But I thought that was just from… not eating much, because I'm afraid of… you know. Making things worse.
DOCTOR: Frequent bowel movements, weakness… and you’re avoiding food due to fear of exacerbating the symptoms. I see. Any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… sometimes. Not a lot. It's… usually just a little bit. Like, streaks, you know? It's not… bright red, if that makes sense. It’s darker. I assumed it was just from… everything going on. But it’s definitely been happening. That’s why I thought I should come in.
DOCTOR: Dark streaks in the stool. Right. Now, Ms. Nahrwold, I need to ask a rather… indelicate question. Have you noticed any changes in your stool consistency beyond simply being diarrheal?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… sometimes it's watery. And… other times it's… softer. Like, not formed, you know? It varies. It's really embarrassing to talk about, honestly. And it’s just… unpredictable. That's the worst part. I never know when it's going to happen.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Nahrwold, based on your history – the chronic diarrhea, cramping, bloating, occasional dark streaks in the stool, and inconsistent stool consistency – it is possible you are experiencing symptoms consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or possibly some other inflammatory process. However, the presence of blood warrants further investigation. We need to rule out more serious causes. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis – specifically, to check for occult blood and infectious agents. We will also need to perform a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Oh… um. That sounds… intense. I don’t know… I’ve never had one of those before. What exactly does that involve? And what if it's… bad? I’m starting to get a bit worried now. I thought it was just a bad stomach bug, or something.
DOCTOR: A colonoscopy is a necessary procedure, Ms. Nahrwold. It allows us to visually examine the entire colon to identify any abnormalities. It involves a flexible tube with a camera inserted into the rectum. It is performed under sedation, so you will be comfortable. "What if it's bad," as you put it, is precisely what we are attempting to ascertain. Ignoring the situation will not make it disappear. We need to be proactive. I will provide you with detailed preparation instructions for the stool sample and the colonoscopy. It's imperative you follow them exactly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Preparation instructions… stool sample… colonoscopy. It’s just… a lot to take in. And the thought of… that procedure… it's a bit scary. Okay. I’ll follow the instructions. Exactly. Can I… can my husband come with me to the appointment? For support? And maybe to help me remember everything? My memory isn’t the best, you know.
DOCTOR: Your husband is welcome to accompany you, Ms. Nahrwold. Though, I expect you to be the one actively engaged in your healthcare. I will schedule the colonoscopy for next week. The lab orders for the bloodwork and stool sample are being sent to the front desk now. Be diligent with the preparation, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For… explaining everything. And for scheduling the appointment. I’ll… I’ll make sure to follow the instructions carefully. And I’ll… try to remember everything. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. See that you do. Next!
