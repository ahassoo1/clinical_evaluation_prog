DOCTOR: Good morning, Venna. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… the pressure, I guess. Been a little high lately, the nurse said. I want to get it sorted, if that’s alright. Don’t want it gettin’ worse.
DOCTOR: Certainly. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to address. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this pressure you’ve been noticing?
PATIENT: Noticin’? Well, I don't notice it, exactly. My daughter, bless her heart, she's been checkin' on me. She bought one of them machines. Said my numbers weren’t lookin’ right. I feel alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but I'm ninety years old, ain't I? That's gotta count for somethin’.
DOCTOR: It absolutely does! And it’s wonderful that your daughter is so attentive to your health. That’s very helpful. So, your daughter has been monitoring your blood pressure with a home machine, and she’s noticed some higher readings. Do you know what those readings were, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… she told me. Numbers… always was bad with numbers. I think she said somethin’ like… one-forty over… ninety? Or was it eighty? Honestly, Doctor, it all just blurred together. She said it was too high, that's all I really remember. She's a nurse herself, so I trust her.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and trusting her judgment is wise. 140 over 90 is considered elevated, yes. We’ll want to confirm those readings here in the office, of course. Before we do that, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or been treated for it in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. This is all new to me. My husband, he had some heart trouble later in life, but I don't think it was this… pressure thing. Mostly just tired, he was. And his heart just… gave out, eventually. I never had any trouble myself, 'til now.
DOCTOR: I see. And when did you first start noticing your daughter was concerned about these readings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… musta been… July, maybe? She started comin’ over more often, checkin’ on me after I fell in the garden. Just a little stumble, nothin’ serious, but she got worried. Started takin’ my pressure every time she came. That's when she told me it was high.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a month ago. And you said you felt alright, mostly, just a little tired. Have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling, like headaches, vision changes, dizziness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little more forgetful than usual, but at my age, that's hardly news, is it? I misplace my glasses constantly, but that's been happenin' for years. No headaches or dizziness, and I can still see just fine, thank you very much. Still do my own baking, and that requires good eyes!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And baking is wonderful! Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than the fall you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital except for that fall. Just a couple of nights to make sure I hadn’t broken anything. They took some x-rays and sent me home. Mostly, I just stay out of trouble. Doctor says I'm too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: That’s a good quality to have! And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That's the only surgery I ever had. Back when they just scooped ‘em right out! It wasn't very pleasant, I can tell you that. But it was a long time ago, and I healed up just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the tonsils as a child. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had a weak heart. She didn't live to be very old. And my brother, he had somethin’ with his kidneys, I think. He was always sick, poor man. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Worked in the fields his whole life and never complained. That's all I can really remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mother with heart trouble and a brother with kidney problems. That’s helpful to know. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my arthritis, Doctor. Keeps the joints from achin’ too bad. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter sleepin’ pills. But that’s it. Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My daughter always worries about me tryin' new recipes, but I haven't had any trouble with allergies. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's move on to some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Lord, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked a little when he was younger, but I always made him go outside. Didn't want no smoke in the house.
DOCTOR: That’s good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Red wine, Doctor. My daughter says it’s good for my heart. But not much. Just a glass or two.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of red wine with dinner. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your daily activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I still do my bakin', like I said. That keeps me movin' around some. I have a little garden, but it's not as big as it used to be. I mostly sit and visit with my daughter when she comes over, or watch my stories on TV. I ain't as spry as I once was, but I still try to keep myself busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture of your lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, then. I got a pie crust needin’ rollin’ later. Don’t want it gettin’ too warm in here, though. Old bones get chilly easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make sure the room is comfortable. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, as your daughter mentioned. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a very faint murmur, which is common in people your age. Your lungs sound clear. Now I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks good, just a slightly dry throat. I'll document that. Overall, the exam is fairly unremarkable, but the elevated blood pressure is something we need to address.
PATIENT: So, what does it mean? Is it bad? I don't want to end up like my husband… tired all the time.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking those questions. High blood pressure, or hypertension, means your heart is working harder to pump blood through your arteries. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is bad right now, but left unmanaged, it can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems – which is why we want to get it under control. It's not the same as being tired all the time like your husband was, although it can contribute to fatigue if it's not addressed. The fact that you're feeling relatively well is good, but we still need to take it seriously. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. These will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. It's standard procedure when we're first diagnosing high blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh dear. I don't like needles. But… if you say it's important. I guess I can manage a little poke. As long as it don't take too long. And as long as it’s just a little poke.
DOCTOR: It will be just a little poke, Venna, I promise. It will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very good. We’ll just need a small sample of blood. The results will help us determine the best course of action. While we’re waiting for the results, and even after, it would be helpful to start making some lifestyle changes. Things like reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise – even just a short walk each day – can make a big difference. We can talk more about those changes in detail. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or lifestyle changes before we proceed?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… Easier said than done at my age, Doctor. But I suppose I can try. Less salt, you say? I do like a good salt sprinkle on my tomatoes… And walkin’? My knees ain't what they used to be. But alright, I’ll try. What about the medicines? Will I have to take pills? I don't much like takin’ pills.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question. It’s good to be concerned about medications. Whether or not you’ll need to take pills depends on the results of your blood tests and how well the lifestyle changes work. We always try lifestyle changes first. If your blood pressure remains elevated despite your best efforts with diet and exercise, then medication might be necessary to protect your heart and kidneys. There are many different types of blood pressure medications available, and we would choose one that’s right for you, with the fewest possible side effects. We’ll discuss all the options thoroughly if that becomes necessary. For now, let's focus on the blood tests and starting those lifestyle changes. We can start small, and see how you do. Would you like me to give you some information sheets about reducing salt intake and healthy eating?
PATIENT: Information sheets… alright. Yes, that’d be helpful. I like havin’ somethin’ to look at. Maybe I can tape ‘em on the refrigerator to remind me. And... how long 'til I get the results? I don’t want to worry about it all day.
DOCTOR: That’s a great idea to tape them on the refrigerator! I’ll have the nurse print those out for you now. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back to us. I'll have my assistant call you with the results as soon as they’re available. If we don’t hear anything within three business days, please don’t hesitate to call the office to check on them. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden symptoms like severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or changes in vision, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just get those results back quick, alright? And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old woman and her worries.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It’s my pleasure. I understand your worries, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll let the nurse know to print those information sheets for you, and we’ll get you scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much!
