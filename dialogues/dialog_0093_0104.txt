DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Bakan, is it? Honestly, I don't have much time for this. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. Just… a pain. Is that all you need to know? I work, you see. Very important work. Don’t have time to sit around explaining everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Ottaviani. Your time is valuable, and I will be as efficient as possible. A sore throat for a few days… alright. To help me understand a bit better, could you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Describe it? It… aches. Like something’s stuck. And it’s… rough. When I swallow, it feels like sandpaper. Is that good enough? Really, Doctor, I separate and filter things all day. Precise work! I don’t usually describe things. Just… fix them.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Ottaviani. And I understand your need for efficiency. “Rough” and “like sandpaper” gives me a better sense of the discomfort. Does the pain radiate anywhere – perhaps to your ears, or your jaw?
PATIENT: Radiate? Is that… spread? I don’t know. Maybe… a little bit in my ears. But probably just the noise at the plant, you see. Very loud machinery. Constant. It’s always something. Don’t think it’s radiating, if that’s what you mean. Just… a pain in my throat. And I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Pain in the throat, perhaps a little discomfort in the ears, and you suspect it may be related to the noise at work. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Don’t be silly. I work hard. Don’t have time to be chilled. Body aches… sometimes I ache. But that’s from lifting, you see. Big filters. Very heavy. It’s not a… a sickness ache. Just… work. Really, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? My shift starts soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Ottaviani. Just trying to gather a complete picture. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or congestion?
PATIENT: Congestion? A little, maybe. It’s… humid where I work. Lots of steam from the machinery. Everything’s damp. Not a sick congestion. Just… the plant. And no cough. I don’t cough. I’m a strong woman. Don’t get sick easily. Look, can we just get something for the pain and be done with it? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. It sounds as though you have a sore throat with some mild congestion, and you believe this may be related to the humid environment at your workplace. Before we discuss treatment, may I quickly examine your throat and ears to get a better look?
PATIENT: Examine? Oh, honestly. I haven't got time for poking and prodding. Just give me something for the pain, Doctor. Honestly. I separate, filter, clarify, precipitate… I don't need to be examined. It's a throat. It hurts. That's all. Do you have anything strong? I have very important work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Ottaviani, and I respect your time. However, a quick examination allows me to rule out other potential causes of your sore throat and ensure I recommend the most appropriate treatment. It only takes a moment. If you remain uncomfortable with an examination, we can discuss symptomatic relief options, but I must advise you that without a proper assessment, it's difficult to determine the best course of action. Would you be willing to let me just look in your throat with a light?
PATIENT: Fine. Look. But quickly. And don't touch me. Honestly, I have filters to clarify, you know. Precision work. Don't take long. Just… look. And then give me something strong. I’m losing valuable time as it is. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Please open wide and say “Ahhh.” Your throat is a little red, and your tonsils are slightly swollen, but I don’t see any signs of a bacterial infection. Your ears look clear. It appears to be a viral pharyngitis – essentially, a common sore throat caused by a virus. It should resolve on its own within a week with supportive care.
PATIENT: A… viral pharyngitis? Is that what you call it? Sounds… complicated. So, what does that mean? Do I need to take time off work? Because I can’t. Filters don't clarify themselves, you know. And what do I take for it? Something strong, I hope. I don’t have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: It means, Ms. Ottaviani, that it’s a common illness, similar to a cold, and it's not usually serious. You likely contracted it from a virus circulating in the community. You don’t necessarily need to take time off work, but I would advise you to stay hydrated, rest when possible, and avoid close contact with others to prevent spreading it. I’m going to prescribe a throat lozenge containing benzocaine and menthol for symptomatic relief. This will help soothe your throat and reduce the pain. I'm also recommending ibuprofen or acetaminophen for any associated fever or body aches. Over-the-counter pain relievers will be sufficient. If your symptoms worsen – such as developing a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain – please return immediately or seek urgent medical attention. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't have time for allergies. Just... give me something for the pain. And make sure it's strong. Honestly, Doctor, I separate, filter, clarify, precipitate… I haven’t got time to be lying in bed. I need to get back to work. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, that is all. Here is a printout summarizing our conversation and the medication instructions. Please, prioritize rest when you can, stay hydrated, and don't hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen. I wish you a speedy recovery, and thank you for coming in today. .
