DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Thank you for seeing me. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A little bit of wheezing, you see. It’s been happening for… a few days now, I think. Not too bad, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Wheezing and shortness of breath are certainly things we want to investigate. Could you tell me a little more about this trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like a tight feeling in my chest. And when I try to take a deep breath, I hear a whistling sound. Not all the time, but when I walk, or even sometimes when I just sit and rest. It's… uncomfortable. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not a pain, exactly. Just… hard to get air.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mrs. Kilton. A tightness in the chest accompanied by a whistling sound on breathing – that’s helpful information. To clarify, when did you first notice these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… maybe about a week ago? It started slowly, just a little bit harder to walk up the stairs. I didn't think much of it at first, you know? Old age catching up, I thought. But it has gotten a little bit worse each day. I don’t remember anything specific starting it, just… it was there one day.
DOCTOR: So, gradual onset approximately one week ago, with a progressive worsening of symptoms. And you mentioned it's exacerbated by exertion, such as walking upstairs. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: That is right, walking makes it worse. Let me think… when I sit very still, it feels a little bit better. And if I drink some warm tea, that helps a little bit too. Not a lot, just… calming, you know? It doesn't fix it, but it makes me feel less worried. I also tried to sleep with my head a little higher on pillows last night, and that seemed to help a tiny bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, so rest, warm tea, and elevating your head during sleep offer some minimal relief. That’s good to know. Now, Mrs. Kilton, beyond this breathing difficulty, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, no cough. My throat is not sore. I have been a little bit tired, but I am an old woman! I am always a little bit tired. I don’t know if that is related. I have not lost my appetite, and no swelling in my legs or feet. I think… that is all. Just the trouble breathing and a little bit of tiredness.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Kilton. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any current medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I used to have high blood pressure, many years ago. But the doctor put me on some medicine, and it has been fine for a long time now. I don’t think I have asthma or… COPD. I’m not sure what that is, even. My heart… I have never had any problems with my heart, as far as I know. I used to be very active, you see. Athletic trainer, I was. Lots of running and jumping. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: An excellent history, thank you. And you said you were on medication for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. I take a small white pill every morning. The doctor said it keeps the pressure down. I have been taking it for… oh, maybe ten years now? I don’t remember the name, I’m sorry. I just know to take it with my breakfast. And I do. Every day.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Kilton. We can look that up. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. When my children were small. That was… a long time ago. And… I broke my wrist once, when I was hiking. But that was just a simple fracture, they put a cast on it, and it healed fine. I don’t think I have ever been in the hospital for anything else. Nothing serious, anyway. Oh! And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. But that was so long ago I barely remember it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, a fractured wrist, and appendectomy. Thank you. Now, Mrs. Kilton, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. The doctor has given me many things over the years, and I’ve always been fine. I take the blood pressure pill every day, as we said, and no problems there. I don't have any allergies to pollen or animals either. I used to have a cat, when I was younger, and I was fine. No sneezing, no itching, nothing.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mrs. Kilton. No known allergies. Now, one final few questions about your family history and lifestyle, if you don't mind. Are there any health conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, asthma, COPD, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my father… he had some problems with his heart when he was an old man. He had to take medicine for it. My sister… she had asthma when she was a little girl, but she grew out of it. And… I think that is all. No one else in my family had any serious health problems, as far as I know. We weren't a family that talked much about those things, you see. Mostly just kept to ourselves. I don't smoke, and I don't drink alcohol. I eat… reasonably healthy, I think. Lots of vegetables. Not too much sugar. I used to be very active, but now I mostly just take short walks.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Kilton, that’s a very thorough history. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and oxygen level. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I just want to figure out what is causing this trouble breathing. It’s a little bit worrying, you see. But I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please take a deep breath in and out for me, that would be wonderful. Okay… I’m hearing some mild wheezing in both lungs, particularly on the exhale. It’s not a terribly loud wheeze, but it’s definitely present. Your chest feels clear to palpation, no tenderness. Now I’m going to listen to your heart. Your heart rate is regular, and I don’t hear any murmurs. Your heart sounds are normal. Your oxygen saturation is currently 94%, which is within a normal range, but a little on the lower end of normal. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated. Alright, Mrs. Kilton. Based on what you've told me and the findings from this exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild asthma exacerbation, or possibly a condition called COPD. It’s difficult to say for certain without further testing. Would you mind if we order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to get a better understanding of what's going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… asthma or… COPD. That sounds… serious. I've never had asthma before. And I don't know what COPD is. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, please do those tests. I want to know what is causing this trouble breathing, and I want to feel better. A chest X-ray and… a pulmonary function test. Whatever those are. Just tell me what I need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You’re the expert.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Kilton. I understand your concern, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. A chest X-ray is a simple imaging test that can help us look for any abnormalities in your lungs. A pulmonary function test involves breathing into a machine that measures how well your lungs are working. Both tests are non-invasive and relatively quick. I’m going to order those tests now. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the chest X-ray, and we can perform the pulmonary function test here in the clinic today, if you’re up to it. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of an inhaled bronchodilator – that’s a medication that helps open up your airways – to see if it improves your breathing. It’s a common treatment for asthma and COPD. We will reassess your symptoms after you've taken the medication and once we have the results of the tests. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. An inhaler… to help me breathe. And then the tests, to find out what is really wrong. That makes me feel a little bit better, knowing we are doing something about it. Whatever you think is best. Yes, please, prescribe me the inhaler. I will take it right away. And I will schedule the tests as soon as possible. I want to feel better, and I trust you to help me do that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. It’s my pleasure. I’m prescribing you albuterol, a commonly used bronchodilator. You'll take two puffs every four to six hours as needed for shortness of breath. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to use it correctly before you leave. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to rule out any infection. While the symptoms point towards a respiratory issue, it's always best to be thorough. We’ll review the results of all these tests together once they’re available. In the meantime, if your shortness of breath worsens significantly, or if you experience any chest pain or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Albuterol… two puffs when I need it. And the blood test. And if it gets worse, go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor Delacour. I feel much better now, knowing we have a plan. You’ve been very patient and kind, and I appreciate it very much. I will schedule the tests right away, and I will take the inhaler as you instructed. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Get well soon, and have a good day.
