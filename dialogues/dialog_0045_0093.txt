DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Doctor Billman, right? Look, honestly, it’s… fuzzy. Something about not sleeping great and feeling a bit rubbish. My wife… she used to handle all this sort of thing. She’d make the appointments, remember what the doctors said… I just… show up. It's about getting back to feeling normal, I suppose. Not sure where to start, really.
DOCTOR: Right. “Rubbish,” you say. Okay. Well, we all start somewhere. It is helpful when someone else manages things, isn't it?
PATIENT: It is. Massively. I mean, she had a system. Little notes, reminders… everything. Now I just… wake up tired. And then I’m trying to fix fiddly bits of violins all day, which doesn't exactly help the energy levels, you know? It's hard to concentrate when you're dragging. I suppose... is there a test for 'feeling rubbish'? Because if there is, I'm probably top of the list.
DOCTOR: Violins, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. Musical instrument repair. Been doing it… ages. Since before… well, never mind. It's a skilled trade. Requires a steady hand. Which, as I said, isn’t always available these days. Mostly it’s violins, cellos, the odd guitar. People are… particular about their instruments. More so than they are about their health, it seems.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Let’s see… Medicare… August 2nd, 2025… Ah, yes. I see a couple of previous visits, a few years back, for… routine check-ups. Nothing major. Okay. So, this fatigue and general feeling of being “rubbish” – how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: A few years, definitely. After… everything. It sort of crept up on me, I think. At first, I just put it down to… well, you know. Grief. But it hasn't really lifted, has it? It’s just… constant. I’m not sure “constant” is the right word… it’s more like… everything’s muffled. Like I'm underwater. It's hard to explain. And honestly, I'm not very good at remembering details anymore. So, how long… I genuinely couldn’t say. Months? Years? It all blurs.
DOCTOR: Right. "Muffled," you say. And difficulty remembering… okay. And has this affected your appetite or your weight at all?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I still eat, if that’s what you mean. Probably too much, if anything. Comfort eating, I suppose. Can’t say I’ve noticed any significant weight change though. I’m a tall bloke, always been pretty thin. Always been able to eat whatever I want and stay… this shape. It’s more the lack of energy than anything. I could eat a horse, but I wouldn’t have the oomph to chase it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. And are you sleeping okay when you are sleeping?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. I get to bed, I lie there… I think I sleep. But I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. Restless, maybe? I wouldn’t say I toss and turn, but it’s not… restorative. Like I’ve just been lying very still for eight hours. And then I’m back to fiddling with tiny screws, trying to make violins sound beautiful. Which is hard when you're exhausted. It’s a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: ...Excuse me? I’m not entirely sure I follow. Is that… relevant? Look, I came in about sleep and feeling rubbish, not… that. I’m a bit old-fashioned, maybe, but I don’t usually discuss… that with doctors. Is there a reason you're asking?
DOCTOR: It’s standard, Mr. Redfern. Part of the process. Helps to get a full picture. Just a quick yes or no. Any changes?
PATIENT: Fine. No. No changes. Perfectly normal. There. Happy? Can we get back to the sleep now? I’m starting to think this whole ‘full picture’ is more trouble than it’s worth. I’m not here to provide a detailed anatomical report, Doctor. I'm here because I feel dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's move on. Any headaches, dizziness, blurred vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing major. Just a bit of a pressure, behind the eyes. Stress, I assume. I spend all day staring at tiny things, trying to make them perfect. Dizziness, no. And my vision… fine. As far as I know. I haven’t had it checked in years. Probably should, I suppose. But honestly, if I can still see well enough to fix violins, I figure it’s good enough. This is all a bit… invasive, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? No. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. I might get a little winded if I have to climb a lot of stairs, but I don’t do much climbing. Mostly I sit at my workbench. Look, I’m a reasonably fit bloke for my age, despite the fatigue. I used to… well, never mind. No chest pain, no palpitations. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? Because frankly, I’m starting to feel more stressed now than I did when I walked in here.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Really? Is that what you think? No. Absolutely not. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s it. Never smoked a day in my life. And recreational drugs… good heavens, no. I repair musical instruments, Doctor, not… whatever you’re implying. That’s a rather… condescending question, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: My mother had… something with her heart, I think. A valve, maybe? She was quite frail in her later years. My father… he was always remarkably healthy. Strong as an ox. That’s about all I remember, honestly. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t particularly interested in medical details even then. Family history isn’t exactly my strong suit. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't believe in filling myself with pills unless absolutely necessary. My wife used to take something for her… never mind. But I’ve never been one for medications. I figure a good night's sleep and a bit of fresh air are usually enough. Though, as you can see, the good night's sleep is rather elusive at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Let’s do a quick physical exam then, shall we?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Now? I hadn't anticipated… Well, alright. If you think it's necessary. But please, nothing too… intrusive. I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind me saying so. And I’d appreciate it if you could explain what you're doing as you go along. I like to know what’s happening, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Breathing is clear, but slightly shallow. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Alright. Overall, physically you appear… unremarkable. But your fatigue and difficulty sleeping are concerning.
PATIENT: Unremarkable, are you sure? That's what everyone said about my wife, before… nevermind. Look, I'm not a doctor. I just want to feel normal again. So, what does 'unremarkable' mean? What’s next? Are you going to send me for tests? Or suggest some sort of… miracle pill? Because frankly, at this point, I’m willing to try anything. But please, no more probing.
DOCTOR: Right. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I suspect this could be a number of things. It’s unlikely to be a single issue. We should rule out some common causes. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. We will also check your blood sugar and cholesterol. Also, I recommend a sleep study. It will give us a better understanding of what's happening when you sleep. And honestly, Mr. Redfern, I think you should consider speaking to a therapist. Grief can manifest in many ways, and it’s important to address those emotional needs. A pill won't fix everything.
PATIENT: A sleep study… a therapist… more tests… Honestly, it's all a bit overwhelming. My wife would have known exactly what to do. She’d have a list of questions, a schedule, everything perfectly organized. I suppose… I suppose I can do the tests. But a therapist… I don’t know. I’m not one for talking about my feelings. It feels… unnatural. And all this fuss… for a bit of sleeplessness and fatigue. Fine. Do the tests. But please, let's keep it simple. And no more talk of feelings. When can I schedule these tests? And how much will they cost? I'm on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the lab requisitions printed for you. The blood work can be done at any Quest Diagnostics location. The sleep study… we can schedule that at the Regional Sleep Center. Medicare should cover most of the cost, but there may be a co-pay. I’ll have my assistant verify your coverage. She can also schedule the sleep study for you. Here are the lab requisitions and a list of local Quest locations. And I’ll write a referral for the sleep study. In the meantime, try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. And avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime. It sounds simple, I know, but it can make a difference. We'll discuss the results when they come back. And I strongly recommend you consider the therapist referral. It's a valuable resource. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A regular sleep schedule… caffeine… yes, I suppose. It's just… easier said than done. And a therapist… look, I appreciate the suggestion, really. But I think I just need a good night's sleep. That’s all. And honestly, I don't even know where to begin looking for a therapist. It feels… intrusive, asking strangers about my personal life. No, I don’t think so. No more questions. I just want to get this over with. When will the test results be back? And can I call the office if I have any questions?
DOCTOR: The blood work should be back within 3-5 business days. The sleep study results will take a bit longer, maybe a week or so after the study is completed. You can absolutely call the office with any questions. My assistant, Sarah, will be happy to help. Her number is 555-1234. And Mr. Redfern, if you start experiencing any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call immediately. Alright. I’ll see you back in a week or so to discuss the results. Try to get some rest. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I… I will. Good day.
