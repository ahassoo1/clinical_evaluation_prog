DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Morning. It's… the cough. Been coughin’ up stuff. Not just regular stuff, you know? There’s… blood in it. Been happenin’ a while now. I smoke, if that matters. Just want it to stop, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. I understand. A cough with blood is certainly something we need to investigate. And yes, your smoking history is very important information. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: Uh… how long? Geez. A few months, I guess. Maybe longer. Time kinda… blurs. It's worse in the mornin’, usually. And when I… when I’ve been workin’ a lot. Power stuff, you know? Always runnin’ around. It’s a dry cough mostly, but then… then it gets… that other stuff comes up. Not a lot of blood, just… streaks. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, worse in the morning and with activity. And you’re describing streaks of blood, not a large amount. That’s helpful information. To clarify, Mr. Reyno, when you say “power stuff,” could you tell me what kind of work you do?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I… distribute power. And dispatch it. For the… the town. You know, keep the lights on. Lots of drivin’, checkin’ lines, makin’ sure everything's workin’. Sometimes I gotta climb poles... not as much now, but… used to. It's… physical work. Sometimes dusty, I guess. And loud. Lots of machines.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're a power distribution worker, which involves driving, climbing poles, and exposure to dust and noise. That gives me a better understanding of your potential exposures. Now, let's talk a little more about the cough itself. Aside from the blood, would you describe it as painful?
PATIENT: Nah, not really painful. More… irritatin’. Like somethin’s ticklin’ the back of my throat. Makes me wanna clear it, but… nothin’ much comes up when it’s not… that cough. And it makes my chest feel… tight sometimes. Not always, but… yeah. Tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritatin' with a sensation of something tickling in the back of your throat and occasional chest tightness. That's helpful. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… uh… let me think. I get tired easy, I guess. But I always have. Work's hard. Maybe… a little short of breath sometimes. But, again, could be the work. I… I don't know. I ain’t really been sick sick, just… this cough. And tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and occasional shortness of breath in addition to the cough. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… I don't think so. Not that I know of. Doc at the Pueblo clinic, he… checked me up a few times, but never said nothin’. Just the usual. Medicare stuff. I… I get checked when they tell me to. Used to have trouble with my back, from climbin' poles, but that's old news. And… I think that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical conditions, some old back trouble. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had nothin’ cut open. No surgeries. Nope. Just… bumps and bruises from work, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mom, she… passed a long time ago. Can't remember what she died of, honestly. And I don’t really have… close family. A few cousins, but haven't seen 'em in years. Never really talked about… sickness. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Reyno. We can work with what you know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Don't think so. Never had a reaction to nothin’. I don't take much medicine, 'cept when I got a bad cold. And… I can eat whatever.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Nothing. Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. Helps me stay awake for work, you know? That's it. No pills, no nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Reyno. Now, I'd like to do a physical examination. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart, and feel your lymph nodes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah. Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just… try to be quick, alright? Got things to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your lungs now. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. I hear some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, and some mild wheezing on both sides. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not significantly concerning at this point. Your reflexes are normal. Heart sounds are regular, although a slight murmur can be heard. Okay, Mr. Reyno. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary findings of the exam, I’m concerned about the cough with blood, the diminished breath sounds, and the enlarged lymph nodes. It could be a number of things, including a lung infection, bronchitis, or something more serious. To get a clearer diagnosis, I would like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh… X-ray and blood work. Sounds… complicated. Is it gonna take long? And… is it expensive? I just… don’t wanna get stuck with a huge bill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Reyno. It does sound complicated, but it's important to get a clear picture of what's going on. The chest X-ray will take about 15-20 minutes, and the blood work will only take a few minutes. We’ll send the blood work to the lab and get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a day or two. Because you have Medicare, the cost should be covered, but there may be a small co-pay. Our billing department can verify the exact amount for you before you leave today, and we can discuss any potential financial concerns. Would you like me to go ahead and order the tests?
PATIENT: …Alright. Go ahead. Just… get it over with. The sooner I know, the better. And… yeah, check with the billing people before you do anything. Don't wanna be surprised, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Reyno. I understand. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. Here is a requisition form for the X-ray and blood work. The X-ray technician is just down the hall, and the lab is around the corner. Once you’ve completed the tests, please let the receptionist know, and they will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as a high fever, severe shortness of breath, or increased bleeding – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you head off to get those tests done?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I think that’s it. Just… gotta get it done, right? Thanks. I guess. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, let's get those tests done. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Reyno. We'll get this sorted out. And please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Take care and I'll see you soon.
