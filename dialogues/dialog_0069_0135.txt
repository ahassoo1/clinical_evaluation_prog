DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. Nice to meet you too. I am here because… how you say… my ear. It is leaking something. A little bit of… liquid. It started maybe… three days ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo, leaking from your ear for about three days. Can you describe the liquid to me?
PATIENT: It is… not much. Clear, mostly. Sometimes… a little bit yellow. Not… thick. Watery. And… no smell, I think. I try to wipe it away with a cloth. It does not… hurt, exactly. Just… feels strange. Like something is… not right.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear or slightly yellow, watery discharge, no pain or odor. And it feels strange, not right. Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in your ear along with this leakage?
PATIENT: Hearing… hmm. Maybe a little bit quieter. Not much, though. I have to… listen closer to the television. But maybe that is just… old age. No ringing. Nothing like… zzz like that. Just… quiet. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of quietness, you have to listen closer to the television. Have you had any fever, chills, or any dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I check my temperature yesterday. Normal. No chills. And… no, I do not feel dizzy. I walk fine. Everything is… steady. I eat good, sleep good, mostly. This ear… is the only problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And have you noticed this happening before, or is this the first time you’ve experienced this with your ear?
PATIENT: This… first time. I have… little earaches sometimes when I am sick with a cold, but… never leaking. Never this. I am… worried, maybe. It is just… strange.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Radillo. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. I do not have… what you say… diabetes. And my blood pressure… the doctor checked it last year. He said it was… okay. A little high, maybe, but… okay. I take a small pill for it, sometimes. A white one. But mostly… I am healthy. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, you take a white pill occasionally for slightly high blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… the box is at home. It is… small letters. I can not remember the name. The doctor… he writes it down. I give it to the pharmacy. They give me the pills. I do not… memorize the name. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Radillo. We can look it up in your records. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I try everything. Shellfish, peanuts… everything. Never… rash, or trouble breathing. Never. I think my mother… she was allergic to something, but I do not know what. I do not have her allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you had any ear surgeries or any serious ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: No, never surgery. And… small infections, maybe when I was a boy. But nothing… serious. The doctor gave me drops. They helped. That was… long time ago. Very long time ago. Not like this leaking. This is… different.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's do a quick examination of your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside your ear canal. This might feel a little cool, but it shouldn’t be painful. I see some slight redness inside your ear canal, and there is some fluid present, as you described. Your eardrum looks intact, but it's a bit cloudy. I don’t see any signs of a rupture, which is good. It appears you have otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, likely caused by a mild infection. It's common, and usually responds well to treatment.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Swimmer's ear? I do not swim. I have not… swim for many years. Is it… bad? What treatment? I do not understand. Is it… contagious? Will it go away on its own? I am… confused.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Mr. Radillo. It's called swimmer's ear because it's common in swimmers, but anyone can get it – even if you haven't been swimming. It happens when moisture gets trapped in the ear canal, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. It's not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can worsen. It’s not contagious. As for going away on its own, sometimes it does, but it can take a long time and there's a risk of it getting worse. The best course of action is to treat it with ear drops. I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. You'll need to put them in your ear twice a day for seven days. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Seven days, twice a day… alright. Antibiotic ear drops… are they… strong? Will they have… side effects? And… how do I put them in? I have… trouble sometimes with bottles. And… if it does not get better after seven days? What then? I worry… a little.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, and it’s smart to ask. The ear drops are generally very safe, and side effects are rare. Some people might experience a little bit of itching or discomfort when they first put them in, but that usually goes away quickly. As for putting them in, I understand your concern with the bottle. Here’s what I recommend: Warm the bottle slightly by holding it in your hand for a few minutes. Lie on your side with the affected ear facing up. Gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal. Put a few drops into your ear, and then gently wiggle your earlobe to help the drops spread. Stay lying on your side for a few minutes to allow the drops to absorb. If it doesn't get better after seven days, or if your symptoms worsen, please come back and see me. We may need to consider a different treatment or rule out other possibilities. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes. Warm the bottle… pull my ear… lie on my side… seven days. I can do that. And… if it gets worse, come back. Okay. Will the drops… hurt? And… can I still… wash my hair? I do not want… water to get inside. Will that… make it worse? I am… careful. I always try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Mr. Radillo. The drops shouldn’t hurt, but they might feel a little cool or tingly at first. That’s normal. And yes, you can still wash your hair, but you need to be careful to keep water out of your ear. You can use earplugs if you’re concerned, or you can put a cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly in your ear to create a waterproof seal. Just be sure to remove the cotton ball after washing your hair. Here's the prescription for the ear drops. It's sent to your pharmacy, so you can pick it up whenever you’re ready. I’ll also print out some written instructions for you, just in case. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You explain very well. I will be… careful with the water. And… I will try to remember everything. Thank you. You are… very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. If you do have any concerns or questions after you start the ear drops, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Get well soon, and have a good day.
