DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Pfennig. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am here because... well, my daughter, Elodie, she needs some help at home. I think we are looking at what they call... Home Health, yes? And Hospice, perhaps? She is not doing well, and I want to be sure she is comfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're navigating some difficult things right now, Mr. Bahta, and it’s good you’re seeking support. We can definitely discuss Home Health and Hospice options. To best understand what services would be most helpful for Elodie, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… difficult to speak about. Elodie, she is… she has been very weak for some months now. The doctors, they say it is a problem with her lungs. She tires very easily, and she needs help with… everything, really. Eating, bathing… she is mostly in her bed now. I am doing my best, but it is… a lot. I work, you see, as a surgeon. Pediatric, actually. It is hard to balance everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly challenging, Mr. Bahta, balancing work and caring for Elodie. Being a surgeon yourself, you understand the complexities of health, which I'm sure makes this even harder. When did you first notice Elodie becoming weaker, and has this been a gradual decline, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It began, I believe, about… November of last year. She was complaining of a cough, a small one, at first. We thought it was just a cold. But it did not go away. Then, she started tiring easily. Walking up the stairs… she would need to stop and rest. It was gradual, yes. Very gradual. By January, she could not walk at all without help. And now… now she is mostly in bed. We have been to many doctors, of course. Many tests. But… well, they have not been able to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you know what tests have been done?
PATIENT: Yes, I have the list here, actually. Let me see… there was a chest X-ray, a CT scan of her lungs, a pulmonary function test… and several blood tests. They did a biopsy, too, of a small spot on her lung. It was… not good news, I am afraid. They said it was a rare form of… I forget the name. Something with the cells. It is all very complicated.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. This is helpful. “Rare form of… something with the cells.” Okay. Do you recall the name of the doctor who delivered that news, or the name of the hospital where the biopsy was performed?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It was Doctor Armand Dubois, at Saint-Luc Hospital. A very good doctor, very serious. He explained everything… as best he could. I remember that he said the prognosis… was not good. That Elodie’s condition would continue to worsen, and that there was little they could do to stop it. That is when we started thinking about… Home Health, and Hospice. It is… difficult to accept.
DOCTOR: It is incredibly difficult to accept, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like Dr. Dubois was very forthright with you, which, while hard to hear, is important. Knowing what was discussed with him will be very helpful. Just to clarify – and please correct me if I’m wrong – you've been told Elodie has a progressive lung condition with a poor prognosis, and you’re exploring options for comfort care at home?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… precisely it. Progressive, yes. That is the word. And comfort care. That is what I want for her. I want her to be as comfortable as possible, and I want her to be at home. She loves her home. And… I want to be able to spend as much time with her as possible. I can work from home, sometimes. But it is… a lot. I worry about being able to provide her with the care she needs. That is why I am here. To see what help is available.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bahta. You're a devoted father, and wanting to provide the best care for Elodie while also managing your work and life is admirable. We can absolutely explore what resources are available to help. Let’s talk about her current symptoms. Besides the weakness, what other challenges is Elodie experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… she has trouble breathing, of course. That is the biggest problem. She coughs a lot, and sometimes she feels… anxious. She says she feels like she cannot get enough air. She is also not eating much. Just small bites, and even then, she tires easily. And… she is in pain, sometimes. Not constant, but it comes and goes. We give her medication for it, but it does not always help. And… she sleeps a lot. More and more each day. It is… heartbreaking to watch.
DOCTOR: It sounds like she's experiencing a lot of difficult symptoms, and it's completely understandable that it's heartbreaking to watch. Let’s talk about the pain medication she's currently taking. What is the name of the medication, and how often is she taking it?
PATIENT: Thank you. The medication… it is called Tramadol, I believe. The doctor prescribed it… about two weeks ago. She takes two pills, every four to six hours, as needed. But it does not always seem to help. Sometimes she says it makes her feel… groggy, and confused. And it does not always take the pain away. It is… a difficult balance. We do not want to give her too much, but we also want her to be comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tramadol, two pills every four to six hours as needed. It sounds like it’s not providing adequate relief, and the side effects are concerning. Before we discuss Home Health and Hospice further, I'd like to do a brief physical exam of Elodie, if that’s alright with you. It will help me assess her current condition and make the best recommendations for her care. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That would be… very helpful. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. She is upstairs, in her bedroom. I will… show you the way. She is resting now, but she is easily awakened.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's go ahead then. And please, take your time. I’ll follow your lead.
PATIENT: Very good. This way. It is just up the stairs, and then the first door on the right. Be careful, the carpet is a little worn.
DOCTOR: Thank you for the warning. This is her room. As you can see… it is quite cozy. She loves flowers, so I try to keep it bright for her.
