DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Chagaris, you say? Hmm. Well, to be frank, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. I was told – strongly told, mind you – that a visit might be… advisable. Something about stress. Honestly, I’ve always found that people these days throw that word around far too easily. It’s the work, I suppose. Teaching… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been feeling some pressure at work, and someone suggested a visit to assess how you’re handling it. That's perfectly reasonable. We'll certainly take the time to explore that. To get a better picture of what's been going on, could you tell me a little more about what specifically at work is causing you stress?
PATIENT: “Specifically?” Honestly, the entire atmosphere is dreadful. These youngsters… no respect for knowledge, no discipline. They question everything! And the administration… utterly spineless. They cater to every whim, every complaint. It's a library, not a… a daycare center! I've been teaching for… well, a very long time. And it used to mean something. Now? It’s just… a job. A very trying job, I might add. Is that specific enough for you, Doctor? I haven’t the patience for a detailed recounting of every single infraction.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schlatterer, that is quite specific, thank you. It sounds like there are significant frustrations with changes in the work environment, and a feeling that the values you hold dear are not being upheld. That would be understandably stressful for anyone, especially after a long and dedicated career. Beyond the frustrations at work, have you noticed any physical symptoms that might be related to this stress?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness. Well… I suppose I’ve been rather… tired. Not the sort of tiredness one recovers from with a good night’s sleep. It's a… draining sort of fatigue. And my stomach hasn’t been quite right, if I’m being honest. A bit… unsettled. But honestly, at my age, what isn't unsettled? It’s probably just… old age. I doubt it’s anything worth bothering you with, Doctor. Really. I just want to know if there’s a quick solution to get me through the remaining months of this… ordeal.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Schlatterer. Fatigue and stomach upset are certainly things we should explore, even given your age. They can absolutely be related to stress, but it's important to rule out other possibilities as well. When you say “unsettled,” could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It's… indigestion, I suppose. Or heartburn. A general feeling of… discomfort. It comes and goes, but it’s persistent enough to be irritating. I’ve tried those antacid tablets, the ones advertised on the television. They help a little, but only temporarily. It’s not… debilitating, Doctor. I’m not ill. Just… inconvenienced. And increasingly exasperated. Is this truly necessary? I have papers to grade, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I assure you, I’m trying to be as efficient as possible. Even seemingly minor discomfort can significantly impact your quality of life, and it’s my job to investigate the cause and offer solutions. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest idea. A few childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… the usual things. As an adult… nothing significant. I’ve always been a remarkably healthy individual. A robust constitution, you might say. I had my appendix removed, decades ago. And a bout of shingles a few years back. But other than that… perfectly fine. Really. It’s not as if I’m constantly ailing. I simply wish to be free of this… this persistent annoyance.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. That's helpful. No major illnesses, appendix removed, shingles… I appreciate you sharing that. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. I eat everything. I’m Bulgarian, you know. We eat… robust food. Spices, meats, dairy… everything. I haven't the time for fussy diets or sensitivities. I suspect these modern sensitivities are largely imagined, if I’m being perfectly frank. But no, Doctor. No allergies. Absolutely none. Can we please proceed? This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. And thank you for clarifying. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just those antacids I mentioned earlier. And occasionally, a pain reliever for my… creaky joints. Something simple, like ibuprofen. But only when absolutely necessary. I try to avoid medications whenever possible. They always have such unpleasant side effects, you know. I prefer to… tough it out. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a remarkably self-sufficient individual. I assure you, I don’t require a great deal of medical intervention.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for minimizing medication, Mr. Schlatterer. That's perfectly reasonable. To get a more complete picture, could you briefly describe your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history? Oh, for goodness sake. My parents… they lived to a reasonable age. My father had… heart trouble, I believe. My mother… arthritis, perhaps. But honestly, Doctor, I barely remember. It was a long time ago, and frankly, it's not terribly relevant. People get old and things wear out. It's the natural order of things. I doubt there’s any genetic predisposition to anything in particular. A robust constitution, I tell you. That’s what we were known for.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there may be some history of heart trouble and arthritis in your family. While it's not always definitive, it can sometimes provide helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What precisely do you mean by “lifestyle”? I teach. I read. I grade papers. I occasionally listen to classical music. Is that sufficiently… stimulating for your purposes, Doctor? I don’t engage in any frivolous activities. I certainly don’t spend my time… exercising or socializing. I prefer a quiet, contemplative existence. It’s hardly a glamorous life, but it’s… sufficient.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you have a fulfilling, intellectually stimulating routine. Do you currently use tobacco or alcohol?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I find both utterly distasteful. Smoking is… barbaric. And alcohol… a social lubricant for those with poor conversational skills, I suspect. I haven’t touched a drop in decades. My parents instilled in me a healthy respect for… moderation. And a deep aversion to anything that impairs one’s faculties. Honestly, Doctor, I maintain a remarkably disciplined lifestyle. Are we nearing the end of this interrogation?
DOCTOR: We are getting close, Mr. Schlatterer. Thank you for your candor. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and perhaps take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick about it. I have papers to grade, you know. And frankly, I find these examinations… undignified. But if it must be done, let’s get it over with. Just… try not to poke and prod too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… excellent. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, and I hear a slight murmur. Not necessarily concerning, but worth noting. Your lungs sound clear, but your breathing is a bit shallow. Now, if you could lie back for me, I’d like to examine your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do detect some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Any pain there specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A little… discomfort there. Not sharp, precisely. Just… a dull ache. I hadn’t consciously noticed it until just now, but… yes. It’s been… intermittent. Come and go. I assumed it was indigestion. But now that you mention it… perhaps not. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s just my age. Things ache when one reaches a certain… vintage. But proceed, if you must. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: I understand. The tenderness in the upper right quadrant is mild, but it does warrant further investigation. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not critically high. Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests and a scan of your abdomen to rule out any underlying issues. It could be something as simple as inflammation, but we need to investigate to be sure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests and scans… Of course. It’s always something, isn’t it? Very well. But please, Doctor, I implore you to expedite the process. I haven't the time for endless waiting rooms and bureaucratic delays. And I expect a clear explanation of the results, in language a reasonable man can understand. No medical jargon, if you please. Simply tell me what’s wrong, and how quickly I can return to my… normal life. And please, no unnecessary procedures. I’m not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Schlatterer. I will certainly prioritize getting these tests scheduled as quickly as possible and will explain the results to you in plain language. I assure you, I will only recommend further procedures if absolutely necessary. We'll start with a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an ultrasound of your abdomen. The ultrasound will help us visualize your liver, gallbladder, and other organs. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood now and schedule the ultrasound for as soon as possible. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come in, likely within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you've covered everything. Just… expedite the process, as I said. And please, no surprises. I’m not a man who enjoys surprises. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have papers to grade. Thank you for your… attention. .
