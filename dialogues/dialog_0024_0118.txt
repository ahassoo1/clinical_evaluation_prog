DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it seems I require… a certification. For my work, you understand. A rather tedious affair, really. Something about needing to prove I can still see and hear. Honestly, it’s quite insulting at my age, but regulations, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A certification, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A rather standard procedure, I’m led to believe. Though I can’t quite recall who led me to believe that. It’s all a bit of a blur these days, isn't it? Something to do with maintaining my… competence. A dreadful word.
DOCTOR: Right. So, not a medical complaint, simply bureaucratic documentation. I see. Well, let’s get this over with. Have you had a vision test recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Goodness, that’s a difficult question. I do recall something… perhaps last year? Or the year before? It was at a… a fair, I believe. They had a booth. Not terribly precise, I suspect. Mostly just brightly colored shapes. Is that sufficient, do you think? I doubt it was done by a real doctor.
DOCTOR: A fair?
PATIENT: Yes, a fair! A perfectly respectable event, I assure you. They offer all sorts of services. It seemed convenient at the time. One must be practical, you know. Though, admittedly, the lighting wasn't ideal. And the attendant was rather young. Still, I could discern the shapes well enough, I presume. Unless my perception has deteriorated drastically without my knowledge… which is quite possible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, regardless, we will conduct a proper examination here. Let's start with your current vision. Any difficulties reading, seeing at night, or noticing changes in your peripheral vision?
PATIENT: Changes… well, everything seems a bit dimmer than it used to, doesn't it? Naturally. One grows older. And reading… yes, I find myself holding the newspaper further away. Though, that could simply be the font size. The modern newspapers are terribly small, you know. Not like the broadsheets we had in my youth. Peripheral vision… honestly, I haven't made a habit of consciously assessing my peripheral vision. Is one supposed to do that? It sounds rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: So, you’ve noticed a gradual decline in your vision, difficulty reading, and have not specifically monitored your peripheral vision. Very well. Let's move on. Any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it, there is a… a faint whistling sound, occasionally. Though it could be the heating system. This building is quite old, you know. Drafty, and prone to… noises. It comes and goes, really. Not terribly disruptive. Unless one is attempting to concentrate, which is becoming increasingly difficult these days, regardless. Is it something to be concerned about, Doctor? It couldn’t possibly be related to the… fair, could it?
DOCTOR: Unlikely. Now, have you experienced any dizziness or loss of balance recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Goodness, no. I'm a perfectly steady individual, Doctor. Though, I did stumble slightly on the stairs this morning. But that was due to a rather poorly placed rug, I assure you. Not a lack of balance. My balance is… adequate. Perfectly adequate. It’s these modern houses with their impractical design… everything is so cluttered! A proper home should have wide, open spaces, not these narrow corridors filled with… knick-knacks. Is that relevant, Doctor? Do you require a detailed description of my home’s interior?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Oriley, a description of your home is not necessary. Any changes in your hearing other than the whistling?
PATIENT: Changes… well, people seem to mumble more these days, don't they? Or perhaps they simply speak too quickly. It’s difficult to tell. My wife—my ex-wife, that is—always said I had selective hearing, but I attributed that to her rather shrill voice. She always spoke rather loudly. And quickly. Honestly, it was quite exhausting. But other than that… no, I haven't noticed any significant changes. Though, I did miss the beginning of the news broadcast yesterday. Perhaps the volume was too low. Or perhaps the news is simply less engaging these days. A rather dreary affair, generally. Is this all relevant, Doctor? Are we getting anywhere with this… certification?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a basic physical examination. We’ll assess your vision and hearing. Please follow my instructions precisely. And try to refrain from… digressions. Sit straight and look ahead. Begin by reading the top line.
PATIENT: Very well. But I must warn you, I'm rather sensitive to bright lights. And these chairs are terribly uncomfortable. Let’s see… E… F… P… Is that correct? It’s rather blurry, you see. Perhaps I need my spectacles adjusted. Though they were perfectly adequate just this morning. It’s all rather… tedious, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Visual acuity 20/60, right eye. Now, the left eye. Cover your right eye with your hand.
PATIENT: Really? Already? It seems terribly quick, Doctor. Surely, a proper examination requires more… deliberation. E… a bit fuzzy. Is that a P? No, perhaps a Q. These letters are remarkably similar. And the lighting… honestly, it’s quite distracting. Is there a… a possibility this chart is incorrect, Doctor? Perhaps it needs to be recalibrated? It's all rather… unsettling, you see.
DOCTOR: Visual acuity 20/80, left eye. Now, let's check your hearing. I’m going to place this device in your ear. Please let me know when you hear the tone, even if it’s very faint.
PATIENT: A tone, you say? What sort of tone? A high-pitched one? A low rumble? And how faint is “very faint”? It’s all rather vague, Doctor. And I do dislike things being inserted into my ear. It's… unsettling. There… now, what am I supposed to be listening for? Is it a beep? A whistle? A faint scratching sound? Honestly, I can't discern anything at all. Perhaps the device isn't functioning correctly? Or perhaps I'm simply not attuned to this particular frequency. It’s all rather… frustrating, you see. Is there a… a possibility this is a test of my patience, Doctor? Because, frankly, I'm beginning to feel rather… agitated.
DOCTOR: No tone detected in either ear. Very well, Mr. Oriley. Based on this preliminary examination, your vision and hearing are significantly diminished. This clearly indicates you would not pass the certification. I recommend a referral to an audiologist and ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation and potential corrective measures. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Diminished? Significantly diminished? Honestly, Doctor, that's a rather… dramatic pronouncement. I manage perfectly well! I read the newspaper, I converse with people—though they do mumble, as I mentioned—and I certainly haven't noticed any… significant deterioration. And a referral? To specialists? That seems… excessive, doesn't it? It's likely just a temporary issue, perhaps due to the drafty building or the overly bright lighting. Honestly, I suspect this entire examination is… flawed. Do you understand, Doctor, that I’ve lived a perfectly functional life without the need for these… corrective measures? And frankly, I find your tone rather… condescending. I require a second opinion. And perhaps a more… comfortable chair. .
