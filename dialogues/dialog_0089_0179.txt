DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Well, it is… difficult to explain, really. The words… they do not come so easy now. I have trouble… finding them. It has been happening for… some time, I think. Not always, but… more and more. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your speech – finding the right words, and that it's been happening gradually over time. That is frustrating. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: When… hmm. That is a good question. It is… not so clear. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. It started… slowly. I would… stumble over a word here or there. Nothing… major. I thought it was just… being tired, perhaps. But it has… gotten worse. I remember… trying to talk to my wife, and… she would have to prompt me. It was… difficult for both of us.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been happening for at least six months, and it's been progressively worsening. It started with occasional stumbles and has gotten to the point where your wife needs to prompt you to find the right words. Can you describe how it feels when you're trying to find a word?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is… like the word is… on the tip of my tongue. I know what I want to say. I can… picture the thing, or the idea… but the word… it is… hidden. Like a fog, perhaps? I can feel it… close, but I cannot… grasp it. It is… very strange. And… sometimes, I use the wrong word altogether. A word that sounds similar, or… something related, but… not the right one.
DOCTOR: Okay, “on the tip of your tongue,” a feeling of fogginess, and sometimes using the wrong words – words that are similar or related. That’s very helpful. Do you find this difficulty is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days… it is better. I can… speak normally, almost. But other days… it is… very bad. Especially when I am… tired, or stressed. If I am trying to explain something… complicated, it is… much worse. Simple things… like asking for a cup of coffee… that is usually okay. But… anything that requires… thought… is difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates – better on some days, worse when you're tired or stressed, and more pronounced when you're trying to explain complex ideas. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, just to get a fuller picture. Have you noticed any changes in your memory lately?
PATIENT: Memory… hmm. That is… a difficult one. I… do forget things. More than I used to, perhaps. Little things. Where I put my glasses, or… the name of a neighbor. But… nothing major. I still remember… my life, my work… important things. It is… more like… absentmindedness, I think. Not… forgetting who people are, or… important dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more like absentmindedness – forgetting small details, but your long-term memory and important life events are intact. That's good to know. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I… have been a little more tired lately, perhaps. But… I am an older man, yes? That is to be expected. And… sometimes, I feel a little… unsteady on my feet. But… I have always been a little clumsy. No… I cannot think of anything else, really. Nothing… major, or… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and occasional unsteadiness. I appreciate you telling me everything. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I have… high blood pressure, yes. I take medication for it. And… I had a heart problem some years ago. A… blockage, I think. They put a… a small tube in, to keep it open. Other than that… not much. I have Medicare, yes? They keep a good record of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a history of a heart blockage treated with a stent – that’s helpful to know. Medicare does keep good records. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I do not think so. I have taken many medications over the years. My wife… she always kept track of these things. But… I do not recall any… reactions. Perhaps… a little… stomach upset, sometimes. But nothing… serious. I do not believe I have any… true allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known true allergies, possibly some mild stomach upset with medications in the past. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the one, I believe. For the blood pressure. Sometimes, I take something for… my aches and pains. But that is… only when they are bad. A small pill. I cannot remember the name. It is… a white pill, I think. But I do not take it… regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication regularly, and a white pill for aches and pains occasionally. We'll try to get the name of that white pill from your Medicare records. Now, let’s quickly go over family history. Is there anyone in your family with a history of stroke, dementia, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had… some problems with her memory, when she was very old. But… it was just… old age, I think. My father… he was healthy, very healthy. No… I do not recall anyone with… stroke, or… dementia. My wife’s family… I do not know them very well. We did not speak about these things… often.
DOCTOR: Okay, some memory issues in your mother, but no known history of stroke or dementia in the family. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I was married, as I said. My wife… she passed away, two years ago. It was… difficult. I lived with her for… many years. I worked as a… Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist. It was… a good job. I do not… go out much now. I stay home, mostly. Read books, watch television. I have a few… friends, but we do not see each other… often. It is… a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, you were a Compensation, Benefits, and Job Analysis Specialist, you're widowed, and now live a quiet life at home. Alright, Sherrell. I'm seeing your blood pressure medication is Lisinopril, and I'm looking for any record of the white pill you mentioned. It looks like you were prescribed Naproxen for occasional aches and pains. It's an anti-inflammatory. Let me also check your recent blood work… Based on what you've told me, and the information in your record, it sounds like you're experiencing some symptoms that could be related to a few different things. We need to rule out other causes before considering a diagnosis.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to… understand what is happening. It is… unsettling, not being able to… find the words.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is unsettling. I'd like to do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It's a fairly simple exam, and it will help me get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. If it will help… then please, proceed. I will do my best to… cooperate. I am… a little unsteady on my feet, as I said, but… I will try.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Sherrell. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I'm going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. This is normal, and it shouldn’t hurt. Okay, good. Both reflexes are present and symmetrical. Now, could you close your eyes and extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that… correct? I am… a little shaky, perhaps. It is… difficult to hold them still.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Okay, good. A little tremor in both hands, but nothing too concerning at this stage. Now, I'm going to ask you to touch your finger to my finger, and then touch your nose. Repeat that a few times. Do you notice any difficulty with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is… a little difficult. I seem to… overshoot, sometimes. And… it is… slower than it used to be. I have to… think about it, which feels… strange. I usually do not have to think about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that as well. A little hesitancy and some slight inaccuracy. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head, just follow my finger. Are you able to follow my finger smoothly?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. It is… a little tiring, perhaps. And… sometimes, I have to… look around a little, to find it again. It is… not as smooth as it should be. I do not usually have trouble with these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Based on the neurological exam, you have some mild tremor in your hands, some hesitancy in finger-to-nose testing, and some slight difficulty with smooth pursuit eye movements. These findings, combined with your history of progressive speech difficulty and occasional unsteadiness, suggest we need to investigate further. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. We'll also need to repeat some blood work, including a vitamin B12 level and a thyroid panel. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving if you feel unsafe, and it would be helpful if you could have someone accompany you to appointments. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… serious. Is it… something to worry about, Doctor? And… vitamin B12… I have heard of that. Is that… related to the words? I… I do not know if I can drive, as it is. My wife… she always did the driving. It would be… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherrell. An MRI is a very sensitive test, and it helps us get a detailed picture of your brain. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something serious going on. It's simply a precautionary step to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. Vitamin B12 deficiency can absolutely cause neurological symptoms, including difficulty with speech, memory problems, and unsteadiness. It's relatively common, and often treatable with injections or supplements. So, it’s an important test to do. We are still in the early stages of investigation, and it's important not to jump to conclusions. I want to get all the information before making a diagnosis. Given your difficulty driving, I’ll write you a note excusing you from driving temporarily. Do you have anyone who can help you with transportation to appointments?
PATIENT: Yes… I have a neighbor, Mrs. Peterson. She is a kind woman. She sometimes brings me… groceries. She would likely be willing to help. I… I do not want to trouble her too much. And… you said, “treatable.” That is… good to hear. I just want to… understand what is happening. It is… unsettling, not being able to find the words.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful that you have Mrs. Peterson. Don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. And yes, many of the potential causes for your symptoms are treatable. We'll get to the bottom of this. Okay, Sherrell. I'm going to give you a referral to get the MRI scheduled. The order will be sent electronically to the imaging center. They will contact you to set up an appointment. I'll also write you a prescription for a multivitamin, including B12, to start now, just in case. I want to see you back in two weeks, or sooner if your symptoms worsen. We’ll review the results of the MRI and blood work then. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. The MRI… and the blood work. And the vitamin. I will… try to remember everything. Mrs. Peterson… I will ask her. No… I do not think I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. Thank you… for explaining everything so clearly. I… appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. It’s my job. And don’t worry about remembering everything – that’s what we’re here for. We’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Here’s a copy of everything we discussed, the MRI order, and the prescription for the multivitamin. If you have any questions before your appointment, or if you think of anything else, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care, and please try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. It was nice meeting you, Sherrell.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I… I will try. Good day. .
