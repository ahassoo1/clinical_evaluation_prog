DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicky. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about my… a patient of mine. Old Mrs. Gable. She’s on that blood thinner stuff, you know, to prevent clots. And lately, she’s been bruising like a peach. It's… concerning, frankly. She takes everything so seriously, and this is really upsetting her. I just want to make sure it's nothing…serious.
DOCTOR: Right, Mrs. Gable. You're her doctor, and you're concerned about increased bruising while on a blood thinner. That is concerning, you’re right to check it out. Just to be clear, you're bringing this to me because you'd like a second opinion, or are you looking for advice on managing her medication?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? A little of both. I’ve run the usual checks, you understand, but… I haven't seen bruising this bad before. And frankly, I’d like someone else to take responsibility if something…untoward happens. It's just… peace of mind, really. I'm a pathologist, not a general practitioner. I look at samples, not people. I don't do follow-up. So, yes. A second opinion, and advice on…what to do next. I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s perfectly reasonable to want another set of eyes on a case, especially when it’s outside your usual scope of practice. And you're right, managing anticoagulation can be tricky. Before we get started, could you tell me a little more about Mrs. Gable?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? She’s…old. Very old. Eighty-seven, I think. Still sharp as a tack, though. Complains constantly, but sharp. She had a hip replacement five years ago, that’s why she's on the thinner, to stop clots. Otherwise…she’s got the usual ailments for someone her age. High blood pressure, a bit of arthritis. She’s very particular about her diet, lots of fruit and vegetables, avoids red meat. Honestly, she probably takes better care of herself than I do. She's…a good patient, if a bit of a hypochondriac. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Eighty-seven, hip replacement five years ago, on anticoagulation since then, generally healthy otherwise with well-controlled lifestyle factors, and… a tendency to be health-conscious. Is she currently experiencing any pain, beyond the arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. She mentions a bit of stiffness in the mornings, but that’s her arthritis acting up. No new aches or pains. She’s not fallen or bumped into anything recently, as far as she’s told me. The bruising just…appeared. Started about a week ago, she said. Small bruises at first, on her arms, then they started appearing on her legs, even her torso. It’s the extent of it, really. A normal bump wouldn’t cause this much discoloration. She's started worrying about internal bleeding, naturally. She watches too many medical dramas, that woman. Honestly, it's exhausting.
DOCTOR: I see. So, bruising started a week ago, no known trauma, progressively worsening, and now affecting multiple areas including her torso. And she's understandably concerned about internal bleeding. You mentioned she’s on a blood thinner – do you know which one she’s taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… It’s Warfarin, I believe. Five milligrams daily, I think. Though she sometimes forgets to take it on time, or doubles up if she remembers late… Honestly, keeping track of her medication is a nightmare. That’s another reason I’m here, frankly. Her INR has been…variable lately. I’ve adjusted the dosage a few times, but it’s never quite stable. She's…difficult. Demanding. Insists on knowing everything about every single test result, then questions my interpretations. It’s…challenging. And frankly, I don’t have the patience for it anymore.
DOCTOR: Right, Warfarin 5mg daily with inconsistent adherence and fluctuating INR levels. That certainly explains the variable bruising. Okay, let's move on to a quick review of her other medical history, if you don’t mind. Does she have any other significant medical conditions – heart problems, kidney issues, liver disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No heart problems, as far as I know. She had a check-up last year and the cardiologist said everything was fine. Kidney issues… no, she’s always had good kidney function. Liver…well, she used to drink a little sherry, years ago, but she’s stopped now. She has a bit of… diverticulitis, flares up occasionally. But nothing serious. She's generally quite robust, for her age. It's just…this bruising is concerning, and I'd like to rule out anything more serious. I don’t want to send her home and then have something…untoward happen. It would be a disaster.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant heart issues, good kidney function, history of diverticulitis, but otherwise generally robust. And the main concern is the unexplained bruising given the Warfarin use. Before we consider further testing, could you tell me about any other medications she's taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Right. Let me think… She takes a daily multivitamin. And… she's started taking some herbal remedy for her arthritis. Something with turmeric and ginger, I think. She gets it online. She also takes paracetamol occasionally for her arthritis pain, when the herbal remedy isn't enough. And… that’s it, I believe. She’s very careful about what she puts in her body, except for the Warfarin, of course. She's always complaining about side effects, so she tends to avoid taking anything unnecessary. Honestly, it’s a constant battle trying to get her to take the medication she needs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so multivitamin, turmeric/ginger supplement, and paracetamol as needed. That turmeric/ginger is interesting… it can have some anticoagulant effects, which could potentially contribute to the bruising. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about her family history, if you don't mind. Is there any history of bleeding disorders in her family?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders? Hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. She doesn't really talk about her family much, to be honest. She lost her husband a few years ago and… well, she's quite private about that. Her parents both lived to a good age, no history of clotting problems that I know of. She doesn't have any siblings, so there's no one to ask. Honestly, I doubt there's a family history of anything significant. She's… quite self-sufficient, doesn't rely on anyone. And she'd certainly let me know if there was anything like that in her background. She's very… assertive.
DOCTOR: Right, no known family history of bleeding disorders. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about her lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, she lives alone in her own house. Keeps herself busy, gardening, reading, watching television. She used to go to church every Sunday, but she hasn't been since the pandemic. She doesn't smoke, rarely drinks alcohol, as I said, and eats a healthy diet. She gets plenty of exercise, pottering around in the garden. She's… remarkably active for her age, honestly. She doesn't travel much, doesn’t really see many people. She’s quite… isolated, to be honest. But she seems content enough. She's… stubborn, mind you. Very independent. Doesn’t like asking for help. Which makes things…difficult, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for providing all of that information. So, to summarise: 87-year-old female, on Warfarin for a hip replacement, with some adherence issues and variable INR, also taking a turmeric/ginger supplement. No known bleeding disorder history, generally healthy lifestyle, but relatively isolated and independent. Given all of this, I think we should probably do a thorough physical exam to assess the bruising, and then order some blood tests to investigate further. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A thorough exam and blood tests. Good. I’ve already taken her bloods this morning, as a matter of routine, so that should save some time. I'm more concerned about the exam. She's… sensitive. And she'll undoubtedly question every step of the process. But yes. Proceed. Let's get to the bottom of this. The sooner we know what's going on, the better. Just… be gentle with her, alright? And please, don’t try to talk her into anything she doesn’t want. She’s a…strong personality.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. I'll be as gentle and thorough as possible, and I’ll definitely respect her wishes. I'll explain everything clearly and answer any questions she has. Where is she now?
PATIENT: She’s in Room 3, the one near the window. She’s probably already complaining about the temperature. She always is. And she’s likely reading one of those medical magazines, second-guessing everything I do. Honestly, it’s exhausting. But, yes. Room 3. Do… let me know if you need anything. I have other patients to see, you understand. And frankly, I’m a pathologist, not a babysitter. But I appreciate you taking a look at this. Hopefully, you can get to the bottom of it quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll let you know as soon as I have any findings. Thank you for all the information – it's very helpful. I'll head over to Room 3 now. And don’t worry, I’m used to strong personalities.
