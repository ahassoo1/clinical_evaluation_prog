DOCTOR: Alright, Amy Raghunathan, 31 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Nooruddin. I’ve been noticing a lump… a mass, I suppose… in my lower abdomen for a few weeks now. It doesn’t hurt, not really, but it’s definitely there, and it’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a lump in the lower abdomen. Okay. And when you say “a few weeks,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… probably around the beginning of July, maybe the second week? It started small, and I just kind of figured it was something temporary. But it hasn’t gone away, and it feels… a little bigger now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so starting around the second week of July. Has it been gradually getting larger, or did it suddenly appear and then stay the same size for a while before growing?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn't like one day it was just there. It’s been slow, almost unnoticeable day to day, but looking back, it’s definitely grown. Perhaps a little faster in the last week or so? I’m not sure, it’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, with maybe a slight increase in size over the past week. And you said it doesn’t cause you pain?
PATIENT: That's right. No pain, thankfully. Sometimes… a little discomfort, maybe, like a slight pressure? But nothing I would call pain. It doesn’t bother me when I’m walking around, or sitting, or anything like that. It's just… there. And I’m a choreographer, so I’m very aware of my body, and it’s not supposed to be there.
DOCTOR: A choreographer, right. That certainly makes sense that you'd be attuned to changes. Okay. And has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything’s been… regular, I guess? I haven't had any trouble going to the bathroom, if that’s what you mean. And no blood, or anything like that. It's just the lump itself that’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Good, that's good to hear. And what about your urine?
PATIENT: No changes there either. No pain when I go, no blood, and the color seems normal. Honestly, if it wasn't for this lump, I wouldn't even be here. It's just... unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're getting it checked out. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s go over a little bit of your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. My family… we don’t have a lot of medical problems, honestly. My mother has high blood pressure, but that's it. I've never been hospitalized for anything, either. Do you need to know about allergies? I don't have any known allergies, to food or medication.
DOCTOR: That’s all helpful information. No surgeries, no hospitalizations, no allergies, family history unremarkable except for your mother's high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't take any vitamins, supplements, or anything like that either. Just… plain, regular me, usually. This lump is a bit of a shock, to be honest. It feels… out of character.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no supplements. So, before we get to the examination, one final question. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke, I very rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine at a special occasion, that's about it – and I've never used any recreational drugs. I try to keep a healthy lifestyle, mostly because of my work. It's hard to choreograph when you're not feeling well.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drug use. Alright, Amy. It sounds like you’re generally very healthy, which is positive. Now, I'd like to do a physical examination. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table, and I'll gently palpate your abdomen to feel the lump. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don’t mind? It doesn’t hurt, but it’s… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be very gentle. Please lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. And, I'll put a sheet over you to ensure your comfort. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m lying down now. Knees bent, feet flat. Yes, a sheet would be nice, thank you. And I will definitely speak up if it feels uncomfortable. I appreciate you being gentle, Doctor. It's a little nerve-wracking, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to feel around. Hmm. It’s approximately… two centimeters in diameter. It feels firm, but not hard. And it appears to be somewhat mobile… it shifts when I press on it. No tenderness to palpation. Okay. Now I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Bowel sounds are normal. Alright, Amy. I've completed the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it's difficult to say definitively what this lump is without further investigation. It could be a number of things – a benign cyst, a lipoma, or, less commonly, something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a pelvic ultrasound. That will give us a better look at the tissues in that area and help us determine the cause of the lump. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. An ultrasound seems sensible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's good to know what the next steps are. I trust your judgment. A cyst or lipoma… that would be a relief. But it's best to know for sure, of course. When can I schedule the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you feel that way. I will have my assistant schedule the ultrasound for you. The soonest available appointment is next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you so much for fitting me in. Will I need to do anything to prepare for the ultrasound? And… will I get the results immediately after the test, or will I have to wait? I’m a little anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. For the ultrasound, you don't need to do any special preparation. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. And you don't need to do anything special beforehand either. As for the results, the technician will perform the scan and then send the images to me for interpretation. I typically have the results within 24-48 hours, and then I'll contact you to discuss them and go over the next steps. I understand you're anxious, and I will prioritize getting these results to you as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any pain, bleeding, or fever, please contact my office immediately. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that does, thank you. No special preparation, results within 24-48 hours, and to contact you if anything changes. That's very helpful. I appreciate you being so thorough and kind, Doctor Nooruddin. It makes a big difference. I think that’s all my questions for now. I'm looking forward to hearing from you next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. My assistant will come in shortly to schedule the ultrasound and answer any further questions you might have. And remember, don't hesitate to contact the office if anything changes. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
