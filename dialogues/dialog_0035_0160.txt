DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this… tiredness. And this awful habit I’ve gotten into. It’s embarrassing to even talk about, but it’s getting worse. I just feel… drained, all the time. And I keep wanting to eat dirt. Real dirt. Not like, a little bit. A good amount. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness and… a craving for dirt. That's… unusual, but we can definitely explore this. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling drained?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months now. Probably six, maybe eight? It’s not like a sudden thing. It just… crept up on me. At first I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s not getting any better. And now this dirt thing… it’s just adding insult to injury. I used to have so much energy. I was always busy. Now… I just want to sit. And eat clay.
DOCTOR: Six to eight months of increasing fatigue… and the craving for dirt. Okay. Has anything specific changed in your life around the time this started?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… let me think. Not really. Same old, same old. I still work at the clinic – you know, helping people with their exercises. Still live in the same place. Haven’t gone on any trips. I suppose… Mrs. Abernathy moved into assisted living. She was a lovely woman. We used to have tea every Tuesday. But that was… a while ago now. It shouldn’t matter, should it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t necessarily not matter. Changes in routine, even losing a friend, can sometimes contribute to feeling unwell. But let's focus on the tiredness and this craving. When you say craving dirt, can you describe it?
PATIENT: Describe it? Like… a need. A real, strong need. It's hard to explain. It's not like wanting chocolate. It's… deeper than that. It's a feeling in my stomach, almost like hunger, but it won’t go away with food. And it has to be real dirt. The kind from the garden. Red clay is best, if I’m being honest. It sounds awful, doesn't it? A woman my age… eating dirt.
DOCTOR: It does sound concerning, Candis, and we need to figure out what's going on. This craving, what we call pica, can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Before we get too far, let's talk about your diet. Could you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, diet. Honestly, it's not much. I mostly eat… well, whatever's easiest. A little toast with some jam in the morning. Maybe a sandwich for lunch. And a small dinner. I don’t really have much of an appetite anymore. I try to eat vegetables, but I just don't feel like it most days. It’s not like I’m a gourmet cook, you know? And I don’t have anyone to cook for.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a relatively limited diet, not a large appetite. We’ll need to do some blood work to check for deficiencies, specifically iron, zinc, and other essential nutrients. I'm also going to ask a few questions about any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh, dear. Is that really necessary? I… well, they're not regular. If I’m being honest. I have to… work at it, sometimes. And it’s not always… comfortable. I thought it was just old age, again. Everything just… slows down, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It is important, Candis. Changes in bowel habits can give us clues about what's going on. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Has there been any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not… not blood. Just… you know, difficult. And infrequent. I really don’t like talking about this. It's embarrassing enough admitting I eat dirt, let alone discussing… that. Are you sure this is all necessary? It feels like you're asking a lot of personal questions.
DOCTOR: I understand it's uncomfortable, Candis, and I apologize if I'm making you feel that way. But these questions are important to help me understand what's causing your tiredness and this unusual craving. We need to rule out anything serious. It's my job to ask these questions, and everything is confidential. Let's just take it one step at a time. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. One step at a time. But please, let’s hurry. I have errands to run. And frankly, I’m tired just talking about all this. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: We'll do a complete blood count – that checks for anemia and other issues with your blood cells. We'll also check your iron levels, zinc, vitamin B12, and a few other key nutrients. It should only take a few minutes to draw the blood. I’ll also need to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. The quicker we’re done, the better. And please, try not to poke too much. My skin is rather sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here on the exam table. I’ll wash my hands and be right back with the equipment. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll palpate your abdomen, and finally, draw the blood.
PATIENT: .
