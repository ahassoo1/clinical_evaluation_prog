DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is... is okay to call you Doctor Kalinski? Yes, yes. My husband, he find a nice place for me... a senior place. They need... papers. To make sure I am okay to go there. That is why I am here.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Abdollahi, please do call me Dr. Kalinski. And that is perfectly alright – a comprehensive evaluation to ensure your well-being for the transition to a senior living community is an excellent idea. We want to make sure this is a smooth and safe move for you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall... hmm. I work. I still work, you know? At the bar. Not so much now, my hands, they get tired. Before, I work every night. I am... mostly okay. Some aches, but who does not have aches at my age? My husband, he worry too much. He say I need help, but I am strong woman!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you’ve been working for so long, Ms. Abdollahi. It speaks volumes about your strength and independence. And it's good to hear you’re generally feeling okay. It's quite common to experience aches and pains as we get older. But let’s explore those a little further. When did you start noticing these aches, and where exactly are you feeling them?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe two years ago? When I turn seventy. Before that, I feel nothing. Now... my hands, like I say. And my back. When I stand too long, it hurts. And my knees. Sometimes they feel like they will break. Not all the time, but... often enough. Is hard to bend down too.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s very helpful. So, the pain primarily affects your hands, back, and knees, and seems to have developed around the time you turned seventy. You mentioned it's worse with standing and bending. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the type of pain you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Type of pain... is hard to say. Is not... sharp. Not like when I cut myself in the kitchen, you know? Is more... dull. Like a heavy feeling. And sometimes... stiff. Very stiff. I need to move them around to make it better. And heat. Heat always help. A warm bath. That is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull, heavy feeling, sometimes with stiffness, and heat provides relief. That’s very good information. And thankfully it sounds like you’ve found something that helps. Now, thinking about other areas of your body, have you noticed any pain or discomfort anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Sometimes my head hurts. Not big hurts, like a headache. More like... pressure. When I am tired. And sometimes, my stomach. Is not regular, you know? Sometimes okay, sometimes... not so good. My husband, he worry about my eating.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. So, occasional pressure headaches when you're tired, and some irregularity with your stomach. It’s good that your husband is attentive to your well-being. To clarify the stomach issues, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "not so good"?
PATIENT: Is... hard to explain. Sometimes I feel... bloated. Full of air. And sometimes... I go to the bathroom too much. Or not enough. It changes. Is not every day, but it happen. It make me tired, sometimes. And I don't eat so much when my stomach is bad.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s helpful. Bloating, alternating between frequent and infrequent bowel movements, and fatigue when your stomach isn’t feeling well. Now, shifting gears a bit, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me think... oh! For my blood pressure. The doctor give me a little white pill. I take one every morning. And sometimes, when my head hurts, I take... what is it called? Tylenol. Is for the pain. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for your blood pressure daily, and Tylenol as needed for headaches. Do you happen to know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. My husband, he get it for me. He know all the names. I just take the little white pill. It help. I don’t ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. We can certainly look that up and verify it. No problem at all. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Long time ago, when I was young, I have my tonsils out. That is all. And when I have my babies, I was in the hospital, of course. But not for anything… serious. No big surgeries. I am lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Abdollahi. No major surgeries or serious illnesses beyond those. Finally, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she have the sugar. Diabetes, is it? She was sick for a long time. And my father, he have the heart problems. He was very old when he get sick. My brother, he had the cancer. But he... he is gone now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. That is important information. A family history of diabetes, heart problems and cancer. Alright, now I would like to do a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. I trust you, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. I appreciate your trust. First, I'll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat, and gently palpate your abdomen. Your blood pressure is 140/85, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning given some stress with the move. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your ears look clear, and your eyes appear healthy. Your throat is slightly dry, but otherwise normal. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. Does that feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: The tenderness... yes, a little. Sometimes it hurt there, like you say. Not all the time. When I eat too much, maybe. Or when I am... worried. It is not a big hurt, Doctor. I get used to it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Abdollahi. It's good that you're aware of it. Mild tenderness, related to eating and stress – that's helpful information. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, it sounds like you are experiencing some typical aches and pains associated with aging, and possibly some mild digestive issues. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we should monitor. To get a clearer picture of the digestive issues and rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a few routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any hidden bleeding or infection. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests... so many tests. Is okay. If you think is necessary. I trust you, Doctor. But... what do they look for? And is it painful? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Abdollahi. It's wise to ask questions. The blood tests will give us a general overview of your health, looking at things like your blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. They help us identify any underlying issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. The stool test is a simple way to check for any bleeding or infection in your digestive system. As for the needles, they are a little pinch, but very quick. Most people tolerate them well. We’ll draw only a small amount of blood. And the stool test involves collecting a small sample – we'll give you clear instructions on how to do that. We'll schedule these tests at the lab right across the street. They're open every weekday morning. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Across the street... yes, that is good. Not far. Weekday morning... yes, I think so. My husband, he can take me. Is okay. I will do the tests. So, if everything is okay with the tests... then I can go to the senior place? That is what I want. I want a place where I can relax. And not worry so much.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Abdollahi. Yes, exactly. Once we have the test results, we'll review them together. If everything comes back normal, then we can complete the necessary paperwork to ensure you're approved for admission to the senior living community. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want a place where you can relax and not worry. That's a very valid goal, and we’ll do everything we can to help you achieve that. I’ll write up the lab orders now, and our nurse will give you the instructions for collecting the stool sample. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You explain everything very good, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with me. My memory is not so good, you know. But I will try to remember everything you tell me. And my husband, he will help.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s my pleasure to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any questions or concerns come to mind after you leave. And it's wonderful that you have your husband's support. I will see you again once the lab results are back, likely in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe pain, or any changes in your bowel habits, please contact the office immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is everything. Thank you again. I will go now. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please have a good day, and be well. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything.
