DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Hmm... what brings me in... Let me think. It's... going to the bathroom. It's hard now. Not... easy, like it used to be. It takes a while, you see. A long while.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty with urination, and it's taking you longer than usual. That's certainly something we should investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Investigate... that sounds right. It's not pain, exactly. More like... pushing. I have to push a lot. And sometimes... sometimes it just stops. Like the water won’t come out. Then I have to wait, and try again. It's been happening... oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe a few months? It's hard to keep track, you know. Old age.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Stoffregen. It's very helpful to know it's not pain, but more a sensation of needing to push and occasional stopping of the urine stream. A few months, alright. That gives us a good timeframe to work with. Now, when you are able to urinate, do you feel like you completely empty your bladder, or do you feel like some urine remains?
PATIENT: Oh... that's a good question. Hmm... I think it empties. But maybe... maybe not all of it. It’s hard to tell, you see? I don’t really… feel it empty, if you know what I mean. Just... done. I go, and then I’m done. It's not like there's a big difference between when I start and when I finish, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. So, a sensation of not being able to tell definitively if your bladder is fully emptied. Alright. Now, have you noticed any other changes related to your urination?
PATIENT: Changes... oh dear. Let me think. Sometimes... sometimes I feel like I have to go all the time. Even if I just went! It's very annoying, you know? Especially when I'm out... visiting my daughter. And I drink a lot of water, I always have. So... I guess that could be it? More water, more trips. But it's more than that, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased frequency – needing to urinate more often, even shortly after you’ve gone, despite drinking a normal amount of water. And you suspect it's more than just the water intake. That's helpful information. Now, are you experiencing any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not at all. Like I said, it's not painful. Just… hard. And the waiting. Lots of waiting. It's not a sharp pain, or anything like that. More of a... strain. You know, like you're trying to push something through that shouldn't be pushed through. It's just... tiring, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no burning, just difficulty and straining. It sounds quite tiring, Ms. Stoffregen, and I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history... that's a long story. I've lived a long life, you see. I had a baby, of course. A beautiful daughter. And... I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. A long time ago. And... I had my gallbladder taken out. That was… painful. But other than that... not much, I think. Just the usual old age things. A little bit of arthritis, but nothing too bad. I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s helpful. So, a history of childbirth, a broken wrist, and gallbladder removal. And some arthritis, which is quite common. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh... let me think. High blood pressure... the doctor said something about that, a long time ago. But I don't take any medicine for it. He said to watch my salt, and I try to. Diabetes... I don't think so. I don't remember anything about diabetes. And heart... I had some palpitations once, but they went away. Just nerves, I think. My daughter worries a lot, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of being told you had high blood pressure at some point, but not currently managed with medication. No history of diabetes, and palpitations that resolved. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh... let me see. I take a little bit of something for my arthritis, sometimes. It's called... Ibuprofen, I think. When it's really bad. And I take a vitamin D, because the doctor said my levels were low. And... that's it, I think. Just those two. Nothing else. I try not to take too much medicine, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Vitamin D. Thank you for letting me know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My daughter is very careful about what she feeds me, you see. She's a good girl. And... I don't think I'm allergic to anything. No, definitely not.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Stoffregen. No known allergies. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history... that's a long one too. My mother lived a long life, she passed away in her nineties. My father... he had some trouble with his heart, I think. And... my sister had high blood pressure, like me. But other than that... not much that I know of. Everyone just… lived and died, you know? Old age mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of longevity in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. Thank you for sharing that. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... well, I try to stay active. I like to garden, when the weather is nice. And I visit my daughter every week. She makes a lovely tea. I used to go to church, but it's hard to get around these days. And... I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol. Just a little bit of wine with dinner, sometimes. Mostly, I just like to relax and enjoy life. It's been a long life, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you live a very full and healthy life, despite some challenges. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me; it's very helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam... that sounds fine. Anything to help, you know? Just let me know what you need me to do. I'm not very strong these days, but I'll try my best. And thank you, Doctor. You're very kind.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. No need to worry about strength; it's a simple exam. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Alright. And finally, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft, though I did note some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. Your reflexes are normal. I also noticed a slight hesitancy in your gait when you walked. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I would like to order a urine analysis and a post-void residual volume test. This will help us determine if you're completely emptying your bladder and if there's any sign of infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A lot of tests... but if you think it's necessary, then yes, alright. A urine analysis… and a… post-void residual volume test? That sounds… complicated. But if it will help me, then I’m happy to do it. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know what I need to do. And… is it something serious? Is there something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Stoffregen. The tests aren't overly complicated. The urine analysis is simply a sample of your urine to check for infection. The post-void residual volume test is done after you urinate to measure how much urine remains in your bladder. It’s a quick and painless procedure. It's too early to say definitively if there's something seriously wrong, but your symptoms – the difficulty urinating, the feeling of incomplete emptying, and the increased frequency – suggest that there may be a problem with your bladder function. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a urinary tract infection, an enlarged prostate , or weakened bladder muscles. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. We'll get the results back within a few days, and I’ll contact you immediately to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to help flush out your system and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate your bladder. Would you like me to write that down for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that's... a lot of information. But thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol… and drinking more water. Yes, please, could you write that down for me? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. And… it’s good to know you're looking into it. I trust you. And… my daughter will be glad to hear you're taking care of me. She worries a lot, you see. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. Here you are. "Increase fluid intake, avoid caffeine and alcohol." It’s good of you to have such a caring daughter. I’m happy to work with both of you to ensure you’re feeling your best. Now, is there anything else I can address for you today, or any questions you have about the tests or the instructions?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. And very kind. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I feel much better knowing you're looking into it. And… tell me, how long will this appointment take? I promised my daughter I wouldn’t be too long.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. As for the appointment length, we're almost finished. The nurse will just take your blood pressure and schedule the lab tests, and then you'll be free to go. It shouldn't take more than another 15-20 minutes. Is there anyone who will be driving you home today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my daughter is waiting in the car. She always drives me. She wouldn't let me drive myself, even if I wanted to. She's a very good girl. And… thank you again, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Ms. Stoffregen. You're not an inconvenience at all, and I’m happy to provide you with the best possible care. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your daughter arrives. It was lovely meeting you. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you once the results are in.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. And thank you again for everything. .
