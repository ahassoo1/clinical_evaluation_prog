DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s… in my breast. It’s kinda strange, you know? I don't think it’s a bad hurt, but it’s… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain… in the breast area. And you say it’s not constant, just comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Comes and goes. More when I… when I’m working, maybe. I do roofing, so lots of… moving around and using my arms. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, more like… a heavy feeling? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. A heavy feeling… that’s helpful. And it seems to be related to activity, specifically with your roofing work. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly you feel this heavy feeling?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s kinda… here. Not right on the nipple, but close to it. Sometimes I feel it a little bit in my armpit too, on the same side. It’s hard to say exactly. It’s not a big area, but it's… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, left chest, below the nipple, sometimes radiating to the armpit. And is this a new thing, or has this been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Hmm… it started… maybe a month ago? At first it was just a little bit, I didn’t even think much of it. Thought I just pulled a muscle. But it hasn’t gone away completely, and it gets worse when I’m working. So I thought I should come get it checked.
DOCTOR: Alright. A month ago, started mild, now more noticeable with work. And just to be thorough, has anything specifically triggered it, other than the work?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I don’t think so. Nothing I can remember. I mean, I sleep okay, eat okay. Nothing different in my life, you know? Just the work makes it worse. I don’t… I don’t do anything special to my chest, like… massage it or anything. Just work.
DOCTOR: Okay. No specific triggers other than the physical demands of your roofing work. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes to the skin in that area?
PATIENT: Changes to the skin? Hmm… I haven't really looked, to be honest. I mean, I just feel the pain. I haven't… I don't know, checked for anything. Should I be looking for something?
DOCTOR: It's alright, that's perfectly understandable. I just want to cover all bases. When I say changes to the skin, I mean things like redness, dimpling, puckering, any new lumps or bumps, or changes in the nipple itself. We can take a look together in a moment if you’d like. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No fever. No weight loss… maybe a little tired, but that’s just from the work, I think. And no night sweats. Everything else is… normal, I guess. I haven't noticed anything like that. It's just the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no weight loss, no night sweats. Just the chest pain, related to work. Alright. Before we do a physical exam, let’s go over a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My wife gives me some medicine when I have a cold, but I haven’t ever had a bad reaction. I eat everything. No allergies. It's a simple life, you know? No fancy foods, no fancy medicines.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes I take ibuprofen, when my back hurts from work. But not all the time. Just when it’s really bad. And… no vitamins. My wife says I should, but I forget. She’s always telling me to take better care of myself.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for back pain. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you ever had any serious medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me think. Not that I know of. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that healed okay. Nothing else. No doctor ever told me I had anything… serious. Just the usual colds and stuff. My wife is always the one who goes to the doctor. She’s the healthy one.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant medical history other than a childhood broken arm. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… that's a tough one. My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. And I don't really know much about their medical stuff. We didn't talk about that much. I have some cousins, but I haven’t seen them in years. So, not really, no. I don't know about family history. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bulaong. It’s not always easy to know that information. We can often work with what we have. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I used to drink beer sometimes, when I was younger. But not anymore. Maybe a little bit on special occasions now, but not much. And no drugs, never. Just work, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, no drugs. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a closer look at your chest and the area where you’re feeling the pain. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to hurt me too much. I need to go to work later.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Bulaong. Alright. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. And again, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate, or feel, your chest area. I’m starting away from the pain, just to get a baseline. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or different.
PATIENT: It’s okay on this side. No pain here. Just… normal. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, now as I get closer to the area where you feel the pain, can you point to the exact spot where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s… not a sharp pain, but it’s… sensitive. And when you press, it feels… a little bit achy. It’s not too bad, but you can feel it.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling your chest now, and I do feel a small area of tenderness. It doesn't feel like a distinct lump, but there is some sensitivity to pressure. Now, I'm going to check your armpit on both sides, just to see if there’s any swelling or tenderness there. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be careful. My armpits are kinda… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m checking your armpits now. Your right armpit feels normal. On your left side, I do feel a slightly enlarged lymph node, but it’s small and doesn’t seem particularly painful. Now, I’m going to ask you to sit up straight and take a deep breath. I want to see if there’s any difference in the movement of your chest wall on both sides.
PATIENT: Okay. Like that? I don’t really feel anything different. It feels… normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: I don't see any significant difference in chest wall movement, but I'm making a note of everything. Alright, Mr. Bulaong. That completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The tenderness in your chest and the slightly enlarged lymph node on your left side are the most concerning things. It’s possible this is just a muscle strain, but given the location and the lymph node, we need to rule out other things. Would you be comfortable with a mammogram and possibly an ultrasound?
PATIENT: A… a mammogram? What’s that? Is that… serious? I thought only women got those. And an ultrasound? I don't even know what that is. I just thought it was a muscle thing. Is it… is it cancer?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Bulaong. Let me explain. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast tissue. It allows us to look for any abnormalities. While it’s true that mammograms are typically done on women, men can develop breast tissue, and they can develop conditions just like women can. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the tissue, and it can help us see things that might not be visible on an X-ray. I want to be very clear: I’m not saying you have cancer. It's very unlikely. However, these tests will help us rule out any serious causes for your pain and the enlarged lymph node. It’s better to be safe and investigate further, especially because of the lymph node. We’re being thorough. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. So, it’s not automatically cancer? It’s just to… check? How long does it take? And… will it hurt? I need to go to work, you know? I can’t be off work for too long. I’m just… worried, Doctor. I don’t even know anything about this stuff.
DOCTOR: You're right to be worried, and it's perfectly okay to feel anxious. Absolutely, it's not automatically cancer. The vast majority of men with similar symptoms don’t have cancer. It’s a precautionary measure. The mammogram itself usually takes about 15-20 minutes. It can be a little uncomfortable, you'll feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be severely painful. They'll have a technician who specializes in making you comfortable. The ultrasound usually takes another 15-20 minutes, and it’s generally painless. I understand you need to work. We can discuss scheduling the tests at a time that minimizes disruption to your work schedule. We can also talk about a note for your employer if needed. Before we schedule anything, do you have insurance that would cover these tests?
PATIENT: No, no insurance. I haven’t been able to afford it. That’s… that’s why I waited so long to come in. I just hoped it would go away. How much will it cost? I don’t… I don’t know if I can pay for all that.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. That does complicate things, but it doesn’t mean we can’t figure something out. There are programs and resources available to help with the cost of medical care, even for those without insurance. Let me see what I can find for you. There may be financial assistance options, or hospitals sometimes offer reduced rates for those who qualify. In the meantime, I can write you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever to help manage your discomfort while we explore these options. It won't address the underlying cause, but it may provide some relief. I will also have my nurse gather information about financial assistance programs in the area. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be great, Doctor. Thank you. A stronger pain reliever would be a big help. And if you can find something to help with the cost of the tests… that would be amazing. I really appreciate it. You’re… you’re very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. That’s what I’m here for. I'll have the nurse get that information for you and write the prescription. We'll also discuss scheduling a follow-up appointment once we have a better idea of the cost of the tests and your ability to get them. For now, if your pain gets significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms – like a fever, redness, or a lump in your chest – please don't hesitate to come back or go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate everything you’ve done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My nurse will be right with you to go over the information and the prescription. Have a good day, and please take care.
