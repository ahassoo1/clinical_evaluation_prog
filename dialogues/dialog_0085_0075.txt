DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. I see here you’re with Medicare and we're at the suburban clinic location today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Yes, Medicare is keeping me going, thankfully. Well, the main thing is… I’m just so tired during the day. Even though I’m getting treated for sleep apnea, I still feel sleepy all the time. It's a bit frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling tired even with sleep apnea treatment is frustrating. Let’s try to figure out what might be going on. First, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm, well… it’s not like I can barely keep my eyes open, but I find myself dozing off in the afternoon, especially if I’m sitting quietly. Like, reading… or watching television. It’s not a good feeling, and it happens more often than it used to, even with the machine. And it makes it hard to… concentrate, you know? I used to be able to read for hours, now I have to really make myself focus. It’s been going on for… oh, I'd say a good six months now, maybe a little longer. I'm retired now, thankfully, so it's not causing problems at work, but it's just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been happening for about six months, more than just occasional drowsiness, and it's impacting your ability to concentrate and enjoy reading. And it’s happening despite using the sleep apnea machine. That's helpful information. To get a better picture, let’s talk a little bit about your sleep apnea treatment. What kind of machine are you using – is it a CPAP, BiPAP, or something else?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the machine. It's a CPAP, I believe. It’s one of the newer models, fairly quiet, thankfully. The doctor – Dr. Ramirez, back in '21 – fitted me with it. I try to use it every night, religiously. Sometimes it gets a little uncomfortable, the mask leaks a bit, but I adjust it as best I can. I have the hose connected to a humidifier too, because my nose gets dry. I clean it regularly, like they showed me. Honestly, I don't know much about the technical side of it, just that it's supposed to keep my breathing regular while I sleep.
DOCTOR: That's good you're consistent with using it and keeping it clean – that’s very important. And it’s helpful to know about the mask leaks and the humidifier. Leaks can definitely affect how well the machine works, and dryness can disrupt your sleep too. Let’s step back for a moment. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling lately?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Well, I've been a little more irritable, I suppose. My daughter mentioned it when she visited last month. Said I was quicker to snap at her than usual, which I didn't realize I was doing. And my memory… it’s not what it used to be, of course. I’m 83, it’s to be expected. But I feel like it’s been a bit worse lately. Little things, you know? Forgetting where I put my glasses, or the name of an actor in a movie. Nothing major, but noticeable. And… oh, yes. My wife, God rest her soul, used to say I snored like a freight train. With the machine on, it's much quieter, but my neighbor did mention a couple of weeks ago that he could still hear some noise. It was just a passing comment, but I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Paske. It’s very helpful. The irritability, memory changes, and even your neighbor mentioning some noise despite the machine – these are all things we need to consider. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the medical history. Let’s see… I had high blood pressure for a long time, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. My regular doctor, Dr. Silva, manages that. I also had a mild heart attack about ten years ago, but recovered well, thankfully. They put a stent in, and I’ve been taking medication ever since. I also have some arthritis in my knees, which makes walking a bit difficult sometimes. And… oh, I used to have acid reflux, but it's mostly under control with diet and occasional antacids. I think that's about it. Nothing else major that I can recall. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, measles, mumps… but that was a long time ago!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good overview. High blood pressure, a history of a heart attack with a stent, and arthritis. And you’re managing those conditions with medication and diet. Have you had any surgeries in the past besides the stent placement?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Yes, actually. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I had a hernia operation when I was younger, probably thirty years ago. Nothing else comes to mind, really. Small things, mostly. And I've had my share of dental work, of course! But no major surgeries beyond those.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and a hernia repair. Thank you. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, family history. My father had heart disease, unfortunately. He died of a heart attack when he was in his early seventies. My mother had diabetes, and she also developed Alzheimer’s disease in her later years. And my sister… she had breast cancer a few years ago, thankfully she recovered well after treatment. As for the rest of my family, it’s hard to say. I didn’t see them very often, and we didn’t really talk about medical things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Paske. A family history of heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease is important information. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Can you tell me all the medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I take lisinopril for my blood pressure, 20 milligrams every day. And I take aspirin, 81 milligrams, also every day, for my heart. I also take a statin, atorvastatin, 40 milligrams, to help lower my cholesterol. And I take a calcium supplement, just a regular one, because Dr. Silva said my bones were a little weak. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when my knees are really bothering me. And I take a multivitamin, just a basic one, every morning. I think that’s it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lisinopril, aspirin, atorvastatin, calcium, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. That’s a good list. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to any medication, food, or anything else. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that cleared up years ago. Nothing serious, thankfully. I’m not allergic to anything that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That's very helpful. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then I'd like to do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske, your blood pressure is 138/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, although I do hear a very faint murmur, which we'll keep an eye on. Your lungs are clear. Your ears and nose look fine. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your balance is a little unsteady, but you’re able to walk without assistance. Your coordination is good. Now, given your symptoms of persistent tiredness despite sleep apnea treatment, your family history of Alzheimer’s, and the slightly diminished reflexes, I think we need to do some further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin D level. I also recommend a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I want to get to the bottom of this tiredness, and if those tests can help, then absolutely. A cognitive assessment sounds… well, it sounds a bit worrying, to be honest, given my mother’s history, but I understand it's best to be thorough. Yes, please go ahead with all of those tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. I've written the orders for the blood tests and cognitive assessment. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work. The cognitive assessment will be scheduled through our neurology department, and they’ll be in touch shortly. In the meantime, continue taking your current medications as prescribed. If your tiredness worsens or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please contact the office immediately. We'll review the results of the tests once they’re available and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and for being so thorough. I'll be sure to contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll see you back in the office once the results are available. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again. And have a good day to you as well.
