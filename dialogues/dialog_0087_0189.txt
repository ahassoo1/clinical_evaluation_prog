DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Soodeen, you say? Well, it’s about my…business. Down there. I noticed something…unpleasant. Blood, you see. In the stool. Not a good sign, I reckon. I’ve seen things, being a pilot and all, and this…this isn't right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the blood a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Honestly, young lady, blood looks like blood. Red. Sometimes a bit darker, I suppose. Like…well, like cherry juice that’s been sitting out too long. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. It’s not every day a man my age has…that happening. And I don’t go around poking around, if you catch my drift. It just…shows up.
DOCTOR: Alright, red blood, sometimes darker, resembling older cherry juice. And it appears without you noticing anything specific causing it. Has this been a one-time occurrence, or has it happened more than once?
PATIENT: More than once. A few times now, over the past…oh, maybe a week? It comes and goes. I thought it might be something I ate, but I’ve been careful. I’m a sensible man, you know. I don’t just gobble down anything. Though, the food these days…not what it used to be. Still, it's been happening, and it’s unsettling. It's not like I enjoy talking about this, you know. Frankly, it’s…demeaning.
DOCTOR: Okay, occurring intermittently over the past week. And you haven’t noticed any changes in your diet that might explain it. Mr. Rowbottom, I understand this is a sensitive topic, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. To get a better understanding, could you describe any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What sort of symptoms? I feel…old, naturally. Eighty-eight years will do that to a man. A bit tired, maybe, but that’s just life. No…stomach cramps, no…nothing falling out. Just…the blood. And a general feeling of…discomfort. Is that a symptom? Being uncomfortable about having blood in one’s stool? Honestly, it’s enough to ruin a perfectly good day. I used to fly these magnificent planes, you know. Now I’m here, talking about…this. It's a come down.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. No stomach cramps, no changes in bowel habits other than the blood, and just a general feeling of discomfort. Okay. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well, now that you mention it…My trousers have been feeling a bit looser. Not a dramatic amount, mind you. But I used to be a solid 140, and I think I’m closer to 130 now. I blame the hospital food from when I broke my hip. Though, I haven’t been eating as much steak lately. It's expensive, you know, good steak. And this weather…doesn’t encourage a hearty appetite. But yes, probably a few pounds lost. Is that serious? Everything seems to be serious these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss, approximately ten pounds. That is something we need to investigate further. I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. It’s important to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A…physical exam? A rectal exam? At my age? Honestly, young lady, you’re asking a lot. I’ve been poked and prodded enough in my life. What exactly are you looking for? And will it be…uncomfortable? I'm not keen on being subjected to unnecessary…invasions. I suppose I understand it's your job, but…it feels a bit excessive, don’t you think? Can’t you just give me something for it? A pill, perhaps? Instead of all this…prodding.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your hesitation completely. It’s not a comfortable exam, and I wouldn’t suggest it if it wasn’t potentially important. We’re looking for any signs of bleeding, polyps, or other abnormalities that could be causing the blood in your stool. It helps us determine the cause and the best course of action. A pill wouldn't address the underlying issue. I can explain the process in detail, and we can take it slow. You can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. If we don’t get a good assessment with the exam, we may need to consider further testing, like a stool test or a colonoscopy. Would you like me to explain those as well?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Now you’re just trying to scare an old man! Look, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve seen action, I’ve flown through storms, I’ve…I’ve done things. I don’t need some…tube shoved up where the sun doesn’t shine. Honestly. Can’t you just give me something to…stop the bleeding? Some sort of ointment? Or maybe tell me what I should eat? I used to eat a lot of prunes when I was younger. Is that a good idea? Prunes? Or something else? This is getting ridiculous. I came here for advice, not…an invasion.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I completely understand your concerns. I am not trying to scare you, and I apologize if it feels that way. A colonoscopy is the most thorough way to examine the colon and identify the source of bleeding, but it's not the only option, and we wouldn’t do it without a very good reason. Before we talk about more invasive procedures, let’s start with some simpler things. Prunes can sometimes help with constipation, but they won't address the cause of bleeding. I would recommend we start with a stool test to look for hidden blood and any signs of infection. We can also discuss dietary changes to promote healthy bowel movements. Would you be willing to agree to a stool test?
PATIENT: A stool test... that doesn’t sound quite so bad. Taking a little…sample. Alright. Yes, I suppose I can manage a stool test. Better than having a…tube shoved up there. But I want it to be quick, mind you. And I want the results explained to me in plain English. None of this…medical jargon. Just tell me if it’s serious, or if I can go back to eating my steak. And make sure the container is…discreet. I don’t want the neighbors finding out about this. This is embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. A stool test it is. It's a very straightforward procedure, and the lab will provide you with a discreet container. The results will be explained to you in plain English, I promise. I'll also make a note to ensure you understand everything clearly. Here is the requisition. You’ll need to take this to the lab, and they’ll provide instructions on how to collect the sample. Please bring the results back with you when you’re finished. In the meantime, let’s discuss some dietary changes. Increasing your fiber intake with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help promote healthy bowel movements. Staying well-hydrated is also important. Do you have any questions about the stool test or the dietary changes?
PATIENT: Dietary changes, eh? More vegetables. Always the same story. I suppose I can try. Though I can’t promise I’ll enjoy it. I prefer a good roast, myself. And as for questions…will the test be…painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. I have things to do, you know. A man doesn't live forever. And I’d like to know if I should be…concerned. Serious concern, that is. None of this ‘monitor the situation’ nonsense. Just tell me straight. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Rowbottom, that is not too much to ask at all. The stool test itself is not painful. It simply involves collecting a small sample. The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to return results, and I will contact you as soon as they are available. I understand your concern, and I assure you, I will be straightforward with you. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. If the test shows signs of bleeding or anything concerning, we will talk about further investigations, such as a colonoscopy. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We'll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I suppose not. Get the test done. That's what you want, and that's what I'll do. Just…try not to scare an old man, alright? I’ve had enough excitement in my life. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go find that lab. And hopefully, they don’t ask too many questions. This whole thing is…undignified. .
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible. If you have any questions or concerns before you go, please don't hesitate to ask. Here's a card with the lab's address and phone number. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please take care.
