DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Ranjan, is it? Well, it’s this… tiredness. Just awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it really comes. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off? Something about my muscles. Honestly, I don’t keep up with these things. My husband usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness that comes and goes, and some results from the lab that we need to discuss. I understand it can be a little overwhelming keeping track of everything. No worries at all, that's what I'm here for. So, when did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… hard to say. A few months, maybe? It's not like I'm always tired, you understand. I still do things. I… well, I used to. Before my knees started acting up. And the heat doesn't help. But this tiredness… it's different. It just… drains you. Like all the energy’s been sucked right out. I don’t know. A while ago, definitely. It's not new.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months now, it comes and goes, and it’s different than just being worn out. It really drains you. And you mentioned your knees are bothering you, and the heat makes it worse. Can you tell me a little more about what it feels like when you're feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Well… it's not just wanting to sit down. It’s like… everything feels heavy. My arms, my legs… even talking sometimes feels like too much effort. And I get… achy. All over. Not a sharp pain, just… everything feels sore. And I have no… pep. No get-up-and-go, you know? I used to be quite the swimmer, but these days… well, it's mostly just sitting. Not much energy for anything else, honestly. It’s just… debilitating when it hits.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heavy limbs, achiness all over, and a real lack of energy that makes it hard to do things you normally enjoy, like swimming. It sounds quite draining. Do you notice anything that makes it better or worse, besides the heat?
PATIENT: Hmm… better? Honestly, not much. Resting helps a little, but it doesn’t really go away. Worse… well, if I try to do too much, it definitely gets worse. Like if I spend too long in the garden, even just weeding, I'm wiped out for days. And… well, my daughter-in-law made me try one of those fancy exercise classes. That was a disaster. I was absolutely useless. Completely exhausted afterward. It's just better if I don’t overdo it. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so resting provides some relief, but avoiding overexertion seems to be the most helpful thing. And that exercise class definitely didn't agree with you. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other things going on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite… oh, dear. That’s a good question. It comes and goes, like everything else. Sometimes I’m ravenous, and other times… I just don’t feel like eating. I used to enjoy cooking, but these days, it feels like too much bother. My husband does most of it now, bless his heart. I suppose I eat less when I’m feeling tired, because I just don’t have the energy to bother with it. Is that what you're asking? It’s not like I’ve lost a lot of weight, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. So, appetite varies, often less when you're feeling tired, but no significant weight loss. Have you been having any trouble with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, I used to sleep like a log. But these days, it’s… fitful. I wake up a lot. Not necessarily because I’m in pain, just… restless. I toss and turn. And I’m up earlier than I used to be. Sometimes I just lie there for ages before I can get back to sleep. My husband snores, of course, which doesn't help. But it’s not a terrible problem. Just… not the restful sleep I used to have. It's probably just old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so restless sleep, waking up frequently, and not feeling as rested as you used to. And you suspect it might be related to age. We'll explore that further. Now, I want to ask about any other symptoms you may be having. Have you noticed any muscle weakness or pain, besides the general achiness we discussed?
PATIENT: Oh, weakness… yes. Sometimes my arms feel… heavy, even when I’m just holding something light. And my legs… well, they feel like they’re made of lead sometimes. It's not a sharp pain, just… a weakness. It’s hard to explain. Like I don’t have the strength to lift things I used to be able to lift easily. And… well, sometimes I stumble a little. Not a fall, just… a bit unsteady on my feet. That might be my knees, though. Honestly, it’s hard to tell what’s what anymore. Everything just feels… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heaviness and weakness in your arms and legs, and some unsteadiness when walking. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of different things. Let me quickly review some things from your chart. I see your height is listed as 150 centimeters, and your weight is 108 pounds. And you are covered by Medicare. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your reflexes, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a little bit of strength testing. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t take too long, if you don’t mind. I get… impatient. It's just a waste of time if it doesn't lead anywhere. But go ahead. If you think it's important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible, and we’ll take it slow. We'll just start with your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. That's within a normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Okay, your grip strength is a bit weak. And now, can you please try to stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. It's a bit wobbly, you know. My knees… Oh, there. Not very graceful, I’m afraid. It's hard to balance, you see. It's all a bit… precarious. Don't want to fall now, do we? Everything feels… shaky. There. Is that enough? It’s just… tiring, you know. Standing up. Walking. It’s all just… effort.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ardelle. You did very well. And yes, that's enough. I observed some slight unsteadiness and a wider gait as you walked. Okay, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of fatigue, muscle weakness, and some difficulty with balance. There are several things that could be causing this. It could be related to age, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and kidney function. I also want to check your creatine kinase levels to see if there’s any muscle damage. And finally, I want to do a complete blood count to rule out anemia. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, I'm getting rather tired of tests. But… alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. My husband will probably want to know all the details, anyway. He likes to keep track of these things. But… please, don’t order too many, alright? And… can you explain what all these tests are for? Creatine… what was it? It all sounds rather complicated. And will it hurt? I don't like needles. But… alright. If you insist. But explain it to me, please. What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about more tests, and I'll keep it as minimal as possible while still getting the information we need. Let me explain what each test is for. The vitamin levels check for deficiencies that can cause fatigue and muscle weakness. Vitamin D and B12 are common ones to check. The thyroid function test checks if your thyroid gland is working properly, as an underactive thyroid can cause similar symptoms. The creatine kinase test, which you asked about, checks for muscle damage. If your muscles are breaking down, the CK levels will be elevated. And finally, the complete blood count checks for anemia, which is a low red blood cell count that can cause fatigue and weakness. As for the needle, it's just a small prick, and it usually doesn't hurt much. We'll take it slow and gentle. The phlebotomist is very good. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss them and decide on a plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That’s… a lot to take in. But… yes, I think I understand. Vitamin… thyroid… creatine… and… blood. It all sounds rather alarming, doesn’t it? But… alright. If it will help, I suppose. Just… please, don’t find anything too dreadful, alright? And can I still have my afternoon tea after this? I’m feeling rather faint, you know. All this talk of tests and blood… it’s quite upsetting. But… alright. Let’s get it over with. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I have a bridge game on Thursday, you see. I mustn't be too late.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel a bit overwhelmed, Ardelle. We're just trying to rule things out and get to the bottom of what’s causing your symptoms. I don't anticipate finding anything dreadful, but it's important to be thorough. You can go to the lab right down the hall, and it shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. The phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood, and then the results will be sent to me. And yes, absolutely, you can still have your afternoon tea. In fact, I recommend you have a nice cup of tea and a biscuit after the blood draw to help you feel better. And don't worry about your bridge game on Thursday – we'll do everything we can to get you the results quickly. Here’s a lab requisition form. Take this to the lab, and they will take care of the rest. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A lab requisition… Fifteen minutes, you say? That’s… not too bad. And tea afterwards… yes, that sounds nice. My husband makes a lovely Earl Grey. Well… I suppose that’s all, dear. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long with the results, alright? I don’t like to be kept in suspense. And… thank you. For explaining everything, even if it was rather complicated. I appreciate it. Now… I best go and get this over with. It’s just… all rather tiring, you know. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. I will do my best to get the results to you as quickly as possible. I’ll have the nurse give you a call as soon as they’re available. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and enjoy your tea.
