DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Quicksey, is it? A pretty name. Well, I just… thought I’d pop in. My daughter kept saying I should get a check-up, but honestly, I feel fine. Just curious, I suppose. It's not like anything hurts.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to come in for a check-up, even if you’re feeling well. Preventative care is always important. "Just curious" is a perfectly valid reason to be here. To get started, can you tell me a little bit more about why your daughter suggested you come in?
PATIENT: Oh, that girl… always worrying. She said something about my memory. Said I was repeating myself. Honestly, I don't remember exactly what she said. She’s a lawyer, you know? Always looking for problems where there aren't any. It's probably just old age. Happens to the best of us, right? I used to be so sharp, working in the operating room all those years… It’s just not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel that way, Ms. Calvery, and it’s very common to experience some changes in memory as we age. It’s good that your daughter is observant and cares about your well-being. We can certainly explore that further today. You mentioned working in the operating room. That sounds fascinating! Could you tell me a little bit more about what you did there, and for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the operating room. Best job I ever had. I was a surgical tech, you know? Passed everything to the doctors, made sure everything was sterile, kept things running smoothly. I was good at it, very good. Did it for… oh, goodness. Thirty years, maybe? Something like that. It was at City General, back when it was a proper hospital. Not like these fancy places now. All plastic and no substance. Honestly, it’s a blur now, all those years. So many operations… so many faces.
DOCTOR: Thirty years is a significant amount of time! You must have seen a great deal, and it requires a lot of focus and skill to be a surgical tech. It sounds like a demanding but rewarding career. Now, thinking about more recently, aside from your daughter mentioning some memory concerns, have you noticed any other changes in your overall health or how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, my knees ache sometimes. Getting up and down is a bit of a struggle. But that’s just age, right? And I get tired easier. Used to be able to go all day, but now I need a little nap in the afternoon. And… oh dear, what was I saying? It's just little things, really. Nothing to bother a doctor with. Honestly, I'm probably just a fussy old woman.
DOCTOR: Those aren’t “little things,” Ms. Calvery. Those are all important things to discuss, and that's precisely why you're here. Knee pain and fatigue are common, but we want to understand why they’re happening and if there's anything we can do to help. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s a long story. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a child, climbing a tree, foolish thing. And… well, I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, you know. Nothing serious, though. Mostly just aches and pains as I’ve gotten older. The doctors always said I was a strong, healthy woman. My husband, bless his soul, had high blood pressure. That’s about it, I think. He passed away five years ago, you know. It all feels like a blur now.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It’s understandable that things feel like a blur after a loss. Thank you for sharing that with me. So, to clarify, you had your gallbladder removed, a childhood wrist fracture, and the typical childhood illnesses. Your husband had high blood pressure. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never had any of those fancy diseases. Doctors always told me I was healthy as a horse. I ate a good diet, mostly. And I was always active. Just… getting old is hard, you know? It's not like it used to be. Everything aches, and I forget things… Honestly, I’m probably just a hypochondriac. My daughter always said I worried too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And it’s perfectly normal to experience some changes with age. We're not here to label you as anything, Ms. Calvery. We're just trying to get a complete picture of your health to provide the best possible care. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little something for my knees, a pain reliever. Can’t remember the name, though. My daughter gets it for me. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low. And… sometimes I take something for sleep, when I can’t get to rest. It’s just a little something, nothing strong. Honestly, I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a pain reliever for your knees, vitamin D, and something occasionally for sleep. Do you happen to know the dosages of any of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. My daughter handles all that. She has a little chart, I think. Honestly, I just take what she gives me. She's very organized, that girl. I'm terrible with numbers. Always have been. She said the knee pills are… 500 milligrams, maybe? And the sleep pills are tiny, little blue ones. Honestly, I just want to get to sleep. I don't bother with the details.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Calvery. We can try to get the specifics from your daughter if needed. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. I don't think so. Never had a problem with any food. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that's just from the laundry detergent, I think. My daughter switched it a few times, trying to find something that doesn’t bother me. Honestly, I’m not very sensitive. I used to be able to eat anything. Everything tastes so bland now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that even mean? I don’t go to many parties, if that’s what you mean. My husband and I used to go dancing, but… well, that was a long time ago. I mostly stay home now, watch television. My daughter comes over sometimes. I have a few friends I talk to on the phone. Honestly, I’m not a very social person. Never have been.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Social history just means things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any hobbies. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you. And I don’t drink alcohol either. My husband used to have a little beer with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. It tasted… bitter. I prefer a nice cup of tea. Honestly, I'm a very healthy person. Or, I used to be. Everything changes, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. So, no smoking or alcohol use. And you mentioned you enjoy a cup of tea. That sounds lovely. Now, before we proceed, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your health or anything that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I feel a little… off balance. Like I’m going to fall. It’s just a fleeting feeling, really. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. I need glasses to read, and even then, things are a little blurry. And sometimes I have trouble remembering things… my daughter keeps telling me I repeat myself. Honestly, I think my memory is just fading. It’s just part of getting old, right? I don't want to be a bother. I just wanted to get a check-up, like my daughter suggested.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Ms. Calvery, and you’re not a bother at all. Feeling off-balance, changes in vision, and memory concerns are all things we should investigate further. To get a better understanding of everything, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like doctors poking and prodding, but… I suppose I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, dear. My bones are getting brittle, you know. And don't mind the housecoat. I haven't bothered getting dressed today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I will be very gentle. And please, don't worry about the housecoat at all. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 78, temperature is 98.6, and your breathing rate is 16. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs. This could be due to a number of things, and we may need to do some further testing. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears and nose look clear. Your throat is a little dry, but otherwise unremarkable. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal with age, but we’ll make a note of it. Finally, I'm going to do a quick balance test. Okay, you are a little unsteady on your feet. This could be contributing to the feeling of being off-balance you mentioned. Alright, that completes the quick physical exam. Now, do you have any questions about what I found?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was a lot. Crackling in my lungs? Unsteady on my feet? It sounds dreadful. What does it all mean? Am I… sick? My daughter said I was healthy, but… I knew something was wrong. I’ve just been feeling… off. Is it serious? Will I need to go to the hospital? Oh, this is just awful. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Calvery, let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious, but I want to assure you that it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. The mild crackling in your lungs could be due to a number of things, like a mild cold or allergies. The unsteadiness on your feet could be related to changes in your balance or weakness in your legs. We're going to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to take a closer look at your lungs. I also want to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. And finally, I’d like to refer you to a physical therapist for a balance assessment. We are not talking about going to the hospital at this time. We’re simply gathering information to make an accurate diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Testing… I suppose that’s better than just… worrying. Chest X-ray… and blood work… and a physical therapist? It sounds like a lot of trouble. But… if it will help, I suppose. My daughter always said I need to listen to the doctors. She’s very practical, that girl. Will it cost a lot of money? My husband’s pension isn’t very big. I have Medicare, right? And what about the physical therapist? Is that covered? Oh, I hate worrying about money. It just adds to the stress.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Ms. Calvery. That’s a very valid worry. Let me assure you, we will do everything we can to make sure you receive the care you need without putting a financial strain on you. You do have Medicare, which will cover a significant portion of the chest X-ray and blood work. There may be a co-pay or deductible, but our billing department will work with you to determine the exact cost and explore any available financial assistance programs. Medicare also typically covers physical therapy, but the coverage may vary depending on the specific diagnosis and your plan. Again, our billing department will work with you to verify your coverage and determine any potential out-of-pocket costs. I will also have our medical assistant provide you with information on local resources that may be able to assist with healthcare costs. Let's focus on getting these tests scheduled first. I'll have the medical assistant schedule the chest X-ray and draw your blood. Then, we'll get a referral to a physical therapist. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… manageable. A plan is good. I like plans. As long as I don’t have to worry about money too much. And if you could just explain everything to me slowly, that would be helpful. I get confused easily these days. And if my daughter calls, could you just tell her I’m getting some tests done? She worries too much, that girl. Honestly, I don’t need all the fuss. Just tell her I’m fine. Well, relatively fine. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We will take things slowly and explain everything to you in detail. I'll make sure you understand each step of the process before we move on. And of course, I will let your daughter know you are getting some tests done, as you wish, and reassure her that you are under our care. We’ll simply say we’re being proactive and gathering information. The medical assistant will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the chest X-ray. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask. We are here to support you. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, dear. For being patient with me. I know I’m not the easiest patient. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And thank you for not making me feel like a… a silly old woman. I don't like feeling like a burden. I think I'll just sit here for a few minutes and try to relax before the medical assistant comes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden at all, Ms. Calvery. It's my pleasure to provide you with care, and I’m glad I could ease your mind. Please take a few minutes to relax, and I'll be right back to check on you once the medical assistant arrives.
