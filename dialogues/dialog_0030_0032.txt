DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Krok will do, please. Though my wife insists on Radford. It’s… well, it’s a delicate matter, really. A most unpleasant one. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn't… troubling me. I suppose you’ll need specifics, and I confess, I’m not entirely comfortable divulging them. But here I am.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. You can take your time, and only share what you feel comfortable with. We’re here to help in any way we can. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to discuss. Perhaps we can start with what’s been troubling you most recently?
PATIENT: Recently… hmm. It's been… leaking, you see. A discharge. Not a great deal, mind you, but enough to be… bothersome. And frankly, rather undignified for a man of my age. I haven't experienced anything like this… well, not that I recall. It’s been going on for… a week? Perhaps longer. Time does rather slip away, you know. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a keen eye for these things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. A discharge, you said, for approximately a week or longer. And your wife was the first to notice it. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… well, it's not… pleasant. It's… yellowish, I believe. A bit thick, not watery. And there’s… an odor. Not a strong odor, but noticeable. It stains the undergarments, which is… most upsetting. I've always been a fastidious dresser, you see. And this… this is simply not acceptable. I've tried… washing more frequently, of course. But it doesn't seem to help.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that, Mr. Krok. It sounds understandably concerning, and I appreciate you sharing those details with me. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. There’s a bit of… burning, when I… you know. Urinating, that is. Not excruciating, just… uncomfortable. And a slight ache, down there. Nothing debilitating, mind you. It’s more of a nagging sensation. I've also been feeling… rather fatigued lately, but I attribute that to my age, mostly. Old age does come with its… inconveniences, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some burning with urination, a slight ache, and fatigue. And you feel the fatigue is likely age-related. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or abdomen?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t taken my temperature, you understand. My wife usually handles those sorts of things. Chills… no, I don't believe so. And pain in the lower back… occasionally. But that's just my old war injuries flaring up, I suspect. I served in the military, you see. A long time ago, of course. A very different time. It’s probably just arthritis, mostly. Old bones, you know. They do tend to… ache.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. Knowing about your military service and history of back pain is helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted infections? Heavens, no! Absolutely not. I've been a married man for… well, a very long time. A devoted husband, you understand. My wife would never allow it. As for other conditions… I had a touch of the flu a few years back. And my cholesterol is a bit high, the doctor told me. But nothing serious. I take a pill for that, occasionally. I can't recall the name of it, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s helpful to know. And it’s perfectly alright if you don't recall the medication name; we can look that up later. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me see… I recall a bit of a rash once, when I ate some shellfish. But that was many years ago. And a slight itching when I use certain soaps. Nothing serious, mind you. I wouldn't say I have true allergies. My wife is the one with the sensitivities, you see. She can't tolerate gluten, or dairy, or… well, the list is rather extensive, to be honest. I mostly just eat what she prepares for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild reaction to shellfish and some soaps. And your wife has several dietary restrictions. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Besides the cholesterol pill you mentioned, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the cholesterol pill, Doctor. I think it's a statin, something like that. My wife handles the refills, you see. I don’t bother with vitamins or supplements. All that nonsense. A good, healthy diet is all one needs, in my opinion. Though my wife insists on a bit of fish oil now and then. She believes it's good for the… brain, she says. I humor her, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s very helpful. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs, and then a quick examination of the area you’ve been concerned about. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. Well, I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? I’m not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding, you understand. But if it will help determine the cause of this… unpleasantness, then very well. Do try to be gentle, Doctor. I’m a bit of a delicate flower, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle as possible. It will be a quick examination, and I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let’s take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll move on to the examination of the area of concern. Would you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Just… try not to expose me too much, Doctor. I’m a modest man, you see. And perhaps a blanket? It's rather chilly in here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I’ll make sure you're comfortable and covered throughout the exam. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning for your age. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could just relax, I’m going to gently examine the area you’ve been concerned about. I will let you know what I’m doing as I go. I'm noting some mild tenderness to the touch in the suprapubic region. There is no noticeable swelling or redness. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! A bit of discomfort. Not excruciating, mind you, but certainly noticeable. It’s… a dull ache, really. Like a bruise, perhaps. But I haven’t injured myself, you understand. My wife would have noticed. And please, Doctor, do be gentle. This is rather… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. I am being as gentle as possible. The tenderness is mild, but it’s helpful information. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at the skin in the area. I see no signs of rash, lesions, or discharge at this moment. However, given your symptoms of discharge, burning with urination, and tenderness, I suspect a possible urinary tract infection or, less commonly, prostatitis. To confirm this, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture. This will help identify any bacteria present and guide treatment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A urinalysis and a urine… culture? Oh dear. More tests. Very well, Doctor. If it will help determine the cause of this… affliction, then proceed. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of providing samples. It’s… undignified, you understand. Will it be a lengthy process? And will it be painful? I do have a rather sensitive constitution.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. It’s a simple test, and not painful at all. You’ll simply need to provide a urine sample in a sterile cup. A nurse will provide you with instructions and ensure your privacy. The process shouldn’t take long, and the results usually come back within a few days. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to help flush out your urinary system. And try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Increasing fluids… yes, my wife has been urging me to do that for years. And avoiding caffeine and alcohol… well, I don’t partake in those vices much anyway. Very well, Doctor. I shall follow your instructions. A nurse will provide me with the necessary… receptacle, I presume? And she will explain the process? I do hope it’s not too complicated. I’m not as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, a nurse will provide you with a sterile cup and detailed instructions. She’ll be happy to answer any questions you have and assist you if needed. She’s very kind and experienced. Once you’ve collected the sample, you can simply leave it with her, and she'll send it to the lab. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything for now. Though… I do hope it’s nothing too serious. This whole ordeal is rather… unsettling. And frankly, a bit embarrassing. I've always prided myself on my health and well-being. To be afflicted with… this, at my age… it's rather disheartening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. It’s completely natural to feel unsettled and embarrassed. But please rest assured, we’ll do everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide you with the appropriate treatment. Many conditions can cause these symptoms, and often they are easily treatable. We'll review the lab results as soon as they become available, and we'll discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact us if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or if you have any further questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Now, if you’re ready, I can have the nurse come in to collect the sample, and then you can get dressed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… acceptable. The sooner this is over, the better. Very well. Summon the nurse, if you please. And thank you… for your kindness. It’s… reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. We'll get this sorted out. The nurse will be with you shortly. I’ll review the results as soon as they're available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
