DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I just… wanted to get tested for HIV. I’m a compliance officer, you know? Very careful person. It’s just… better to be sure, really. No need to waste time later if something is up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. That is a very prudent approach to your health, and I commend you for taking the initiative. We can absolutely proceed with HIV testing today. Before we do, could you tell me a bit more about why you’re concerned about potential exposure now?
PATIENT: Exposure? Look, it's not like I've been doing anything risky, okay? It's just… things happen. People aren't always careful. And I deal with a lot of paperwork, a lot of different people. It's just good practice to check, you know? Better safe than sorry. I’m married, have a good life… don't need complications. Really, I just want a clean bill of health so I can get back to work. It's not like I'm going to explain all my personal business to you though.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Belan. You are not obligated to share any details you are not comfortable with. Your privacy is of utmost importance to me. It's entirely reasonable to want regular health screenings, especially given your profession and desire for peace of mind. To ensure we proceed appropriately with the testing, could you tell me if you’ve ever had an HIV test before?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... Probably. Years ago, maybe? When I first got married, the doctor probably asked. Honestly, I don’t really remember. It was a different doctor, different town. It was all a blur, to be frank. I doubt it’s relevant. I just need to know now if I'm okay, you know? Not what happened ten years ago.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for current information, Mr. Belan. While past testing isn’t necessarily critical, knowing if you’ve had a previous test helps us interpret the results accurately. Given that you’re unsure about prior testing, we will proceed as if this is your first test. To ensure the most accurate results, we will be performing a fourth-generation HIV antibody/antigen test. This test can detect HIV infection earlier than antibody-only tests. Before we move forward with the blood draw, I'd like to briefly review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Perfectly healthy, as far as I’m concerned. I eat well, I exercise… well, I try to. And I definitely don't have any of those… diseases you mentioned. I told you, I’m a compliance officer. I’m careful about these things. I wouldn't be coming to you if I was riddled with… whatever those were. Look, I just want this over with. Can we just get to the blood draw? I’ve got reports to finish.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your reassurance, Mr. Belan. And I apologize if my questions seem extensive; it’s simply standard procedure to ensure we have a complete picture of your health status. Just a few more quick questions, then we can proceed. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not even vitamins. I prefer to get my nutrients from food. Honestly, I don’t trust all those… chemicals they put in those pills. I eat a fairly balanced diet, considering. And I certainly don’t need anything extra. I’m a very… self-sufficient person. Can we please get to the test now? I’m starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Belan. I apologize for the delay. No medications, that’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I'm perfectly fine. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies these days. A little bit of discomfort never hurt anyone. Latex is… fine. I haven't had any problems with it before. Really, I just want this done. I've got better things to do than sit here answering a bunch of pointless questions. Can we just get the blood taken already? It's a waste of my time, and yours, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. No known allergies, that’s helpful. We can proceed with the blood draw now. I’ll need to take a small sample from your arm. It will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 20-30 minutes to come back, depending on the lab. While we wait, I’d like to discuss the importance of safe practices and post-exposure prophylaxis, just in case, even though you state there’s been no exposure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just… get it over with quickly. I don't need a lecture. And no, I don't want to hear about "safe practices." I know safe practices. I enforce them for a living! Honestly, the whole reason I’m here is to prove I’m careful, not be talked down to about it. Just… take the blood. The sooner this is done, the better. And don't bother explaining anything afterwards, alright? I'm perfectly capable of looking things up myself if I need to.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. I understand. Please have a seat, and I'll get the phlebotomist to draw your blood. I will leave the room to allow for your privacy during the procedure. We will discuss the results privately once they are available. Is there anything I can get for you while you wait - water, a magazine?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… hurry. That's all.
