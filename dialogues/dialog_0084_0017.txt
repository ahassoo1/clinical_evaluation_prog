DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about this… tryout. For the team. I need… the paper. The one that says I’m okay to play. You know, the check-up. It’s… important. I think. It’s been a while since I had one of these.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physical for a team tryout. I understand. It is important to make sure you're cleared to participate. So, just to confirm, you haven't had a check-up in a while... roughly how long would you say?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm… a good many years. Maybe… ten? No, more than ten. I don’t keep track of these things. It’s… not something a man worries about unless he has to, you know? I used to be… more active. But that was… a long time ago. Before the divorce. Everything was different then.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than ten years. I appreciate you being honest about that. It’s good we’re getting this done now. To get a good picture of your overall health, I’m going to ask a bunch of questions. It’ll probably seem like a lot, but it’s important. First, can you tell me about any current health problems you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Health problems… well, my knees bother me sometimes. Especially when it’s cold. And my back… it cracks. A lot. Old age, I guess. Nothing a little liniment can’t fix. I wouldn't call them problems, exactly. Just… things that come with getting older. And, uh… I get tired easier than I used to. But who doesn’t, eh?
DOCTOR: Okay, knees bothering you, back cracking, and fatigue. Let's start with the knees. When do they bother you the most, besides when it's cold?
PATIENT: Mostly when I… well, when I try to do things. You know, bending down, walking up stairs. Things like that. It’s not… sharp pain. More of a… ache. And sometimes they feel a little… loose. Like they might give out. Not often, though. I can still walk, still get around. But it’s… uncomfortable. I used to be able to run like the wind. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, aches and a feeling of looseness in your knees, worse with activity. And you've noticed a change from being able to run previously. Have you ever had any injuries to your knees – any sprains, twists, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Let me think. A long time ago, playing softball… I think I twisted one. It swelled up real bad. Had to wear a brace for a while. But that was… ages ago. And honestly, I don’t remember much about it. It was before… everything. I've bumped them a few times since then, nothing serious. Just… minor things. Does a bruise count?
DOCTOR: Okay, a past knee twist with swelling requiring a brace, and some minor bumps and bruises since then. That’s helpful. Now, about your back cracking – is that painful at all, or is it just a noise?
PATIENT: Just a noise, mostly. It feels… good, actually. Like a little pop. Like getting something unstuck. Sometimes it’s a little stiff beforehand, but it goes away after I crack it. Doesn’t hurt at all. My father used to do the same thing. He said it was… good for circulation. I don’t know. It’s just something I do. A habit, I guess. It’s more annoying to others than it is to me. My ex-wife hated it. Always complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, a habit, no pain associated with the cracking. And you mentioned fatigue – could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, I just… get tired. Easier than I used to. Even after a good night’s sleep. I used to be able to work all day and still have energy for… things. Now, I need to sit down after a few hours. And sometimes, I just… feel drained. Like there’s no pep left in me. It’s not like I’m sick, just… slow. And everything feels… heavier. Lifting things, walking… everything takes more effort. It's… frustrating. It’s not like I’m an old man, but I don’t feel young anymore, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue even after sleep, a feeling of being slowed down, and increased effort with daily activities. To get a better understanding of things, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. Let me see. The doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once. Years ago. He put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. And my ex-wife’s doctor kept telling me I should get checked for diabetes. She worried about everything. I never went. Didn’t see any reason to. Besides that… I don’t think so. Never had any serious illnesses. Just… the usual colds and flus. Nothing that needed a diagnosis. I'm a tough guy. Always been healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past diagnosis of slightly elevated blood pressure with discontinued medication, and a recommendation for diabetes screening that wasn't followed up on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. That’s about it. And… oh! I had a mole removed from my back. Small thing. The doctor said it was just a precaution. Nothing serious. Besides that… no. Never needed any major surgeries. I’m lucky, I guess. Avoided all that. I don't like hospitals. They smell funny. And all those doctors poking around… no thank you. I prefer to just tough it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a mole removal. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had heart problems. Passed away when he was in his sixties. My mother… she had arthritis. Badly. Couldn't move her hands towards the end. And… my brother… he had something with his lungs. Smoked too much, I think. Besides that… not really. Everyone else was pretty healthy. Mostly. You know, the usual old age things. My ex-wife’s family… they worried about everything. So I don’t know much about their medical history. Too much drama.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems, arthritis, and lung issues. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not really. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s not an allergy, exactly. Just… a preference. And… oh! I think I broke out in a rash once after taking some kind of antibiotic. Years ago. But I don’t remember which one. It wasn’t serious. Just… uncomfortable. Besides that… no. I can eat anything. Drink anything. I’m a tough guy, remember? I don’t get sick easily. Most things don’t bother me. Really. Besides cats. I don't like cats. They're sneaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild reaction to an unspecified antibiotic in the past, and a dislike of cats. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not right now. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago, like I said. And I don’t take any vitamins or anything like that. Waste of money, if you ask me. I tried some of those energy supplements once, but they didn’t do anything. Just made my stomach upset. So I stopped taking those too. I prefer to just tough it out. A little liniment for my knees, sometimes. But that’s it. Nothing serious. I like to keep things natural, you know? No need to fill my body with chemicals. That's what my father always said.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements, aside from occasional liniment. Alright, Mr. Bartok, thank you for all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I got things to do, you know? But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be. And… no poking around, if you don’t mind. Just… a quick look. That's all I need. I need to make sure I can play on this team. That's all that matters, really.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look at your knees and back. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds… acceptable. As long as it’s quick. My knees aren’t too bad right now, but they can flare up. And I don’t want to waste too much time. I’ve got a tryout to prepare for, you know? This team… it’s important. So, get on with it. But please, be gentle. My back cracks easily, and I don't want any surprises. And no poking. I hate poking. Just a quick look. That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 76, regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are normal. No murmurs or irregularities. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear. Good airflow bilaterally. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand up… alright. No problem. My knees are a little stiff, but I'm alright. Go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just… be careful with the knees. And don’t make me bend over too much. That’s when they really bother me. I need these knees to play! This team... they're expecting great things. It's a big opportunity, you know? Don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a slight limp on your left side. Let’s check your range of motion in your knees. Can you bend each knee as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Bend my knees… alright. This is… uncomfortable. They don’t bend like they used to. See? Not much movement. Used to be able to squat down real low. Now… not so much. Old age, I guess. It’s… frustrating. I need these knees! This team… they're looking for speed. And I can't be fast if my knees don’t work. Don’t make me do that again. It hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Limited range of motion in both knees, with discomfort. I won’t push you further. Now, let’s briefly check your back. Can you stand with your arms at your sides, and I’ll gently palpate your spine?
PATIENT: Palpate… you mean… poke? I don’t like poking. But… alright. Just… be gentle. And don’t press too hard. My back cracks easily, you know? I don’t want any surprises. Go ahead. But please, be careful. I need this back to be strong. This team… they expect a lot of running. And I can't run if my back is sore. Ouch! That’s a little sensitive. Just… be gentle, alright? It's the lower part. That's where it always bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I apologize. I’m just checking for any areas of tenderness. There is some mild tenderness in the lower lumbar region, but no significant abnormalities. I won’t press further. Alright, Mr. Bartok, that completes the physical examination. Now, given your history and the findings of the exam, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to your fatigue and knee discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… more poking? I don’t like needles. But… alright. If it’s necessary. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And I need the results quickly. This team… they want me to start training soon. I can't waste time with blood work. Just… make it quick. And please, tell them to be gentle. I don’t want to pass out. But… what are you looking for, exactly? Is it something serious? I need to know. This team… they’re counting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It’s not something to be overly worried about, but it’s important to get a baseline. The blood work will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things. It will help us see if there’s anything that could be contributing to your fatigue or knee problems. It should only take a few minutes, and we’ll get the results back within a week. We can also discuss getting an X-ray of your knees to assess the joint space and rule out any structural damage. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: X-ray… more poking around? I really don’t like this. All this poking and prodding… it’s not necessary. I need to train, not spend all day in a doctor’s office. I've been playing sports my whole life. I know my body. But… if it’s absolutely necessary… alright. Fine. But please, make it quick. And tell them to be gentle. I don’t want any surprises. This team… they're expecting great things. I can't let a little poking around ruin my chances. And... what will the X-ray even show? Is my knee broken? I need to know. If it's broken, I can't play. But… can’t you just tell me if I’m okay to play? I don’t need all this fancy testing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn't think they were important. The X-ray isn’t about determining if your knee is broken – it's about looking for signs of arthritis or other wear and tear that might be contributing to your pain and limiting your range of motion. It’s a common injury, especially in athletes, and knowing what’s going on will help us create a plan to keep you healthy and playing the sport you love. I’m not trying to delay you from training, but it’s important to have a clear picture of your overall health before you start. The blood work and X-ray will give us that information. We'll get the results as quickly as possible, and we can discuss a plan for treatment and rehabilitation based on what we find. Does that sound more reasonable?
PATIENT: Rehabilitation… treatment… This is getting complicated. I just want to play. I don’t want treatment, I want to train. But… alright. Fine. Do what you need to do. Just… make it quick. And please, tell them to be gentle. This team… they're counting on me. I can't let all this poking and prodding ruin my chances. But… when can I start training? That’s all I want to know. Can I start next week? If the results aren't back yet, can I at least start some light practice? I need to stay in shape. This team… they expect great things. I can’t let them down. Tell me… can I start training next week? Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. I understand your eagerness. Given your concerns, we can schedule the blood work and X-ray for tomorrow morning. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, ideally within a week. Once we have the results, we can discuss a safe training plan. It's difficult to say definitively if you can start next week without knowing the results, but we can start with some low-impact exercises – walking, stretching, light cardio – once we’ve ruled out any serious issues. However, it’s important to prioritize your safety and avoid any activities that could potentially worsen your condition. We’ll create a plan together that balances your desire to play with the need to protect your health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… Low-impact… stretching… alright. As long as I can do something. I can’t just sit around doing nothing. I need to stay in shape. But… what if the results are bad? What if my knee is broken? Or… or what if I have something serious? Tell me… what are the chances that something is seriously wrong? I need to know. This team… they’re counting on me. I can't let them down. I need to be ready to play. But… what if I can’t? What if I can’t play?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your anxiety, and it's okay to feel worried. However, it's important to remember that we don't know anything yet. It's just as likely that the results will be normal, or show something minor that we can easily manage. The chances of something seriously wrong are relatively low, especially given your history. However, we need to rule out any potential issues to ensure your safety and prevent further injury. We’ll discuss all of the results in detail, and create a plan that’s right for you. If something is wrong, we’ll explore all of your options, including treatment, rehabilitation, and alternative activities. We’ll work together to get you back on the field, but it’s important to prioritize your health and avoid any activities that could potentially worsen your condition. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… Work together… prioritize health… alright. As long as I have a chance to play. So… what do I need to do tomorrow? When do I come in for the blood work and X-ray? I need to schedule it soon. This team… they’re expecting great things. I need to be ready. And… will it hurt? The X-ray, I mean. I don’t like being poked and prodded. Tell me… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. We’ll schedule the blood work and X-ray for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The lab and imaging center are located just down the street, at 123 Main Street. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw – you might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. As for the X-ray, it’s completely painless. You’ll simply lie on a table while the technician takes a few pictures of your knee. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the entire process. And if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… 9:00 AM… 123 Main Street… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. And… no poking, right? Just a quick blood draw and a few pictures? And… what do I need to bring? Do I need to fast for the blood work? I don't want to mess anything up. This team… they’re counting on me. I need to be ready. Tell me… what do I need to bring? And do I need to fast?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. You’ll need to bring your insurance card and a photo ID. As for fasting, yes, please fast for at least eight hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks, except for water. It’s important to have an accurate reading, so it’s best to avoid anything that could interfere with the results. And don’t worry about anything. We’ll make sure everything goes smoothly. Just relax, get a good night’s sleep, and come in tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call us. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Insurance card… photo ID… fast for eight hours… alright. I’ll remember. Thank you, Doctor. You think… you think I’ll be okay to play? You think I’ll be okay?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly natural to be anxious. Right now, I can’t say definitively whether you’ll be okay to play. We need to get the results of the blood work and X-ray first. However, I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to create a plan that allows you to continue doing what you love. We’ll work together, step by step, to ensure your safety and get you back on the field. And remember, even if we find something that requires treatment, there are many options available. So, let’s focus on getting through tomorrow morning, and then we’ll take it from there. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Bartok. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. .
