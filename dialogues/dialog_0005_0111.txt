DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Don… ate, is it? Yes, well. It’s… a discoloration, really. And a tiredness. A profound tiredness. I don't quite recall when it started started, to be frank. It's been… some time. I simply haven’t the energy for these things anymore. Is this going to take long? My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Donate, yes. And it’s alright, we’ll try to be efficient. A discoloration and tiredness… okay. Let’s start with the discoloration. Where is it located?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. On my skin. It's… darkening. A rather unpleasant shade, I assure you. Not what it once was. Mostly on my arms, I believe. And my face. Though I can hardly see my face these days, can I? It's probably much worse than I think. Are you quite sure you need a detailed description? It’s… skin. Darkening skin. Really, is there anything more to it?
DOCTOR: Everywhere, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, not literally everywhere. That would be absurd. But… most of me. The parts exposed to the… elements, naturally. My hands, arms, face… possibly my legs, though I haven't examined them closely. Honestly, Doctor, I've better things to occupy my time with than scrutinizing my epidermis. Is this… a serious matter? My wife worries, you see. And frankly, so do I. But I don't enjoy dwelling on these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this discoloration been getting worse gradually, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. Though my memory is… not what it once was. It’s difficult to say with any certainty. It’s been… a long time, as I’ve mentioned. Years, certainly. A slow fading, perhaps? Or a darkening… I really couldn’t tell you. I simply noticed it one day, and it’s been… there. A persistent annoyance, really. Are you writing all this down? I hope you’re a good listener, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Mr. Drahota. And to be sure, have you noticed any itching, pain, or changes in the texture of your skin alongside this discoloration?
PATIENT: Itching? Good heavens, no. Pain? Absolutely not. Texture… I haven’t run my hands over myself examining it like some… some common laborer. It feels like skin, Doctor. Aging skin, perhaps. A little rougher, maybe. But I assure you, it’s not as if I’ve suddenly developed scales or anything. Really, I find these questions rather… insulting. Are we getting anywhere with this, or shall I simply be dismissed to return to my wife? She’s a very practical woman, and won't appreciate me dawdling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration, but I need to gather information to determine what’s going on. Saying it “feels like skin” isn’t particularly helpful. Now, have you spent a lot of time in the sun over the years?
PATIENT: Sun? Of course, I have. I was a reinforcing iron and rebar worker for… well, for a very long time. It’s rather difficult not to spend time in the sun when your occupation requires you to be outdoors, wouldn’t you say? Though we did our best to shield ourselves, naturally. Hats, long sleeves when possible. But one can only do so much. It's not as if I spent my days lounging indoors sipping tea. Are you implying something, Doctor? That my… profession is to blame for this… discoloration? It was honest work, I assure you. And quite strenuous, might I add.
DOCTOR: I’m not implying blame, Mr. Drahota. Prolonged sun exposure is a risk factor for a number of skin conditions. Now, have you ever had any skin biopsies or treatments for skin cancer before?
PATIENT: Skin cancer? Heavens no. Not that I recall. I've had… a few scrapes and bruises in my time, naturally. Working with iron and rebar isn't exactly a delicate profession. But no biopsies. No treatments. I’m a perfectly healthy man, Doctor, despite my age and… this unfortunate discoloration. I assure you. Though my energy levels… have been waning. But that’s simply a sign of getting older, isn't it? I’m starting to regret coming here. This is a complete waste of time. Perhaps a tonic would be more helpful. Or simply a good rest. Is there anything else you need to know? Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to take a look at the discoloration, if you don’t mind. Could you please roll up your sleeves and loosen your collar?
PATIENT: Very well. But I must warn you, it's not a pretty sight. Years of honest labor have left their mark. And I haven't the patience for prolonged examination. Let’s get this done quickly, Doctor. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see significant hyperpigmentation on your arms and neck, with some areas of thickening. There’s also some roughness to the skin. I’m going to feel for any unusual lumps or bumps. Do you feel any pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… a general discomfort. It’s been years since anyone has examined me like this. It’s… unsettling. And frankly, rather unnecessary. Is this leading anywhere, Doctor? I repeat, is this leading anywhere? My wife will be furious if I’m gone much longer. She has a roast in the oven, you know. A perfectly good roast.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, based on what I'm seeing and hearing, it's difficult to say definitively without further testing. This could be a number of things, from long-term sun damage to a more serious skin condition. I'm concerned about the thickening and uneven pigmentation. I'd like to order a skin biopsy to get a clearer diagnosis. It's a simple procedure, and we can send the sample to a lab for analysis. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A… biopsy? You mean… cutting into my skin? Absolutely not! I’ve already told you, it’s simply sun damage. Years of honest work! I won't have you poking and prodding at me. This is preposterous! No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’m leaving. This has been a complete waste of time. A perfectly good roast is going to be ruined, all for… this!
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your reluctance, but I strongly advise against dismissing this without proper evaluation. Ignoring this could have serious consequences. I will document your refusal of the biopsy. However, I highly recommend you reconsider and schedule a follow-up appointment. I can provide you with a referral to a dermatologist for a second opinion.
