DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, my foot… it’s been bothering me. A sore, really. A bad one. It won't get better, no matter what I do. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. Been hurting for a few weeks now, maybe longer. Hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: A sore, you say?
PATIENT: Not just a sore, Doctor. A bad one. It’s… open. Like a hole. And it hurts when I walk, even with shoes. It’s not getting smaller, and I worry about it getting infected. My wife… she always took care of my feet, but she’s… gone now. I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. An open sore… for how long precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question. Maybe… six weeks? Eight? Time… it goes so fast these days. It started small, like a little cut, and I didn't think much of it. But it just… got bigger. And red. And now it hurts a lot. I try to keep it clean, but it seems to just get worse. I have… the sugar sickness, you know. My wife said something about that being important.
DOCTOR: “Sugar sickness,” as you put it… diabetes, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s what she called it. Diabetes. She took care of it for me, always. Pills and checking my feet… Now I try to remember, but it’s hard. I take some pills, I think they’re for the sugar… but I’m not sure if I’m taking the right ones, or the right amount. Everything feels… muddled.
DOCTOR: Let’s not dwell on what your wife did. We need specifics. Do you have a list of your current medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Not a list. She kept everything organized… in a box, I think. But I haven’t been able to find it. I just take what’s in the bottles. Little white pills, mostly. And sometimes a blue one. I’m sorry. I wish I was more helpful. It’s just… a lot to keep track of when you’re old. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let's have a look at this foot, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That would be good. I’m worried about it, you know. It just doesn’t seem right. It hurts even to put pressure on it. I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. And let me see. Now, try to remain still.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Be careful, please. It’s quite tender. Oh! That’s… a little sore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. A rather significant ulceration on the plantar aspect of the foot, near the metatarsal heads. There’s some erythema and… yes, some purulent drainage. And the surrounding tissue feels…warm. Appears to be a diabetic foot ulcer, possibly with a secondary infection. Dorsalis pedis pulse is… faint. Capillary refill is… prolonged. Your circulation isn't ideal, Mr. Stoegbauer.
PATIENT: Circulation? Oh dear. My wife always said I needed to wear good socks. What does… not ideal mean, Doctor? Is it serious? And what about the infection? Will it… spread? I’m getting worried now. It just feels so… angry.
DOCTOR: It means your blood flow to the foot is compromised, Mr. Stoegbauer. Which is common with diabetes, if it's not managed properly. And yes, the infection could spread. It's a potential complication. We need to address this immediately. I’m going to order some blood work to assess your glucose levels and check for signs of infection. We’ll also need an X-ray to rule out any underlying osteomyelitis. And I'm going to refer you to a podiatrist. They specialize in foot care, and frankly, this is beyond my general practice expertise.
PATIENT: Blood work and… X-ray? Oh my. That sounds… complicated. A podiatrist? Is that a… foot doctor? I just want it to get better, Doctor. I want to be able to walk again without pain. Will they… fix it? Will the podiatrist fix my foot? And how long will all of this take? I don’t want to be stuck here forever.
DOCTOR: “Fix” is a rather simplistic term, Mr. Stoegbauer. The podiatrist will manage your condition. Whether it heals completely depends on several factors – your glucose control, your circulation, and the severity of the infection. As for how long… that is difficult to say. It will require consistent care, strict adherence to their instructions, and regular follow-up appointments. I’m going to prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics to start immediately. And I will send the lab orders to the front desk. Please, do not delay with the blood work and the X-ray. And schedule an appointment with the podiatrist as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Antibiotics… and blood work… and a podiatrist. It’s a lot to remember. I’ll try my best. I just… I wish my wife was here to help me. She always knew what to do. Will the antibiotics… make me feel sick? And how will I… get to the podiatrist? I don’t drive anymore. It’s all so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Side effects are possible, Mr. Stoegbauer. Nausea, diarrhea… consult the medication information sheet. As for transportation… that is not my concern. Perhaps a family member or friend can assist you. Here are your orders. I suggest you arrange your appointments promptly. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, Doctor. I don’t think so. Thank you, I suppose. I appreciate your help. I hope… I hope things get better. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Stoegbauer. .
