DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 38 years of age. Now, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 38. Um… well, it’s my memory. It’s just… not what it used to be, you know? I’ve been forgetting things more and more lately, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory concerns are certainly something we should investigate. “Forgetting things more and more” is rather vague, however. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Well, like, I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and… the word just won’t come to me. Little things, mostly. But it’s happening more often. Sometimes I even… repeat myself without realizing it. It’s embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Repeating oneself… and difficulty recalling the purpose of entering a room. These are… concerning observations. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It hasn’t been, like, overnight or anything. It’s been… over the last six months, maybe? It started small, and I just figured I was stressed or tired. But it's definitely getting worse, not better. I used to be really good at remembering things!
DOCTOR: Six months… that is pertinent information. And you attribute this initially to stress or fatigue?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. I work a lot, long hours at the practice, and… well, being single, I handle a lot on my own, you know? Bills, house stuff… everything. So I just thought it was that. I really didn’t think much of it at first. But now...it's starting to affect work a little, and that's scary.
DOCTOR: I see. And what line of work are you in, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: Oh, right! Sorry, I should have said. I’m a dentist. General practice. It's… it requires a lot of focus, remembering details about patients, procedures… things like that. Which is why I’m so worried now.
DOCTOR: A dentist… yes, that does require significant cognitive function. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… well, I’ve been a little more clumsy lately, I guess. Dropping things, bumping into furniture. But I figured that was just me being tired too. It's hard to say. Everything feels a little… off, but I can't pinpoint anything specific other than the memory stuff.
DOCTOR: “A little off”… While subjective, that is still valuable information. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but nothing major. I've been pretty healthy, actually. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that. I do have Medicare, but it’s mostly just for preventative stuff. I’ve rarely had to use it.
DOCTOR: No chronic medical conditions… That is… reassuring. Any surgical history?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I’m… not really a fan of hospitals, to be honest. I work in a medical setting, but being a patient is different, you know? I've had the standard dentist checkups, of course, but nothing… invasive.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Now, regarding family history – are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or other neurological conditions in your immediate family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Um… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she did get pretty confused towards the end of her life. But we just thought it was old age, you know? She wasn't formally diagnosed with anything. My mother always said she just… faded. My father's side… I don't really know much about their medical history, unfortunately. He wasn't very talkative about those things. So, not really. I mean, nothing that was diagnosed, anyway.
DOCTOR: “Faded”… While not a formal diagnosis, that is still potentially relevant. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke. And I don’t really drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy, like I said. It’s hard when you’re busy, but I do try.
DOCTOR: Abstaining from smoking and limiting alcohol consumption is… commendable. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And I'll take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that's about it. Nothing regular. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. I prescribe them all day, but I don’t like taking them. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I've always been lucky that way, I guess. I don't have any issues with pollen or animals, anything like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I'd like to conduct a brief neurological examination. This will involve testing your reflexes, balance, and cognitive function. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m ready when you are. I hope it’s not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please follow me. We’ll start with your reflexes. If you could sit here, please. I’ll need you to keep your legs relaxed. Now, I'm going to test the deep tendon reflexes in your knees and ankles. This will involve a small hammer. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but shouldn't cause any lasting pain.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. A hammer? Oh. Alright. Just let me know if it hurts, I guess. I’m a little tense, so you might have to be firm. I’m used to having people relaxed in the chair!
DOCTOR: Right leg… good response. 2+ bilaterally. Left leg… also 2+ bilaterally. Normal reflexes. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend both arms in front of you. Now, can you keep your eyes closed and maintain this position for approximately 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm doing it. Thirty seconds… this is harder than it looks. Oh, whoa… I'm trying! This feels a little… unsteady. I’m a little wobbly, I think. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Slight unsteadiness noted. Romberg test: mildly positive. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Please keep your head still and follow my finger with your eyes only. Don't move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm following it. Figure-eight… this is a little… dizzying, actually. But I'm trying to keep my head still. I think I'm doing okay? It's harder than it looks to not move my head. I’m really concentrating.
DOCTOR: Eye movements appear smooth, but with slight hesitancy. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your cognitive function. Please answer to the best of your ability. First, can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: The current date… um… let me think. It’s… August… the 2nd. 2025, right? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I think. It feels weird to have to think about the date.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you spell the word “world” backwards?
PATIENT: Spell “world” backwards… um… let me see… d-l-r-o-w. Is that right? D-l-r-o-w. I feel like I’m doing something wrong. That feels… off.
DOCTOR: Incorrect. It is d-l-r-o-w. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny… okay. Apple, table, penny. I think I can remember those. Apple, table, penny. Yes. That shouldn't be too hard. I hope.
DOCTOR: Now, please tell me those three words again.
PATIENT: Um… apple… and… table… and… oh dear. What was the third one? I… I know there were three, but I can’t remember. It’s… it’s on the tip of my tongue. Table… apple… I can’t…
DOCTOR: Difficulty recalling the third word. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, based on the neurological examination and your reported symptoms, I am concerned about possible early cognitive decline. However, it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis. I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory loss. Additionally, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and possible cognitive testing. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Early cognitive decline? That sounds… scary. Blood tests and a neurologist… yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. It’s unsettling not knowing. Please, let's do whatever tests are necessary. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin B12 level. I will also write a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly regarded neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms and report any significant changes. I will also provide you with a list of resources for individuals experiencing memory loss and their caregivers. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… how long will it take to get the blood test results? And… is Dr. Sharma good? You said she was highly regarded, but… I'm just worried about it all, honestly.
DOCTOR: The blood test results should be available within approximately 3 to 5 business days. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are received. As for Dr. Sharma, she is an excellent neurologist with extensive experience in diagnosing and treating cognitive disorders. Many of my patients have seen her and have been very pleased with her care. She is thorough, compassionate, and takes the time to explain everything in detail. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s natural to be worried when facing uncertainty. Remember, we are taking the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any preferences regarding the location of the laboratory for the blood tests?
PATIENT: No, no preferences. Whatever is closest is fine. Honestly, I’m just glad we’re getting this sorted. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. This has been… overwhelming. But I feel a little better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It is my pleasure to assist you. Remember, if you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms, such as confusion, difficulty speaking, or weakness, please seek immediate medical attention. I will have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the blood test results and Dr. Sharma’s findings. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Paraskevopoulos. I really appreciate your help. I’ll call to schedule the blood test as soon as I get home. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Heidenthal. Take care, and please do not hesitate to reach out if needed. .
