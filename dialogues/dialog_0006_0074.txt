DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's my blood pressure. Been runnin' a little high, the nurse said. My regular doctor retired, see, and they told me to come on in here. Just want to get it sorted, if that makes sense. Don't want no trouble with it.
DOCTOR: Right, blood pressure. Okay. And how long has the nurse been saying it's been high?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe a couple months now? I go in for check-ups every few months, you know, just to keep things lookin' alright. She mentioned it at the last two visits, I reckon. Didn't feel bad, though, not 'til just recently. A little tired, maybe. But mostly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, noticed at the last two visits. And recently you’ve been feeling a little tired… anything else alongside that tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe a bit more… forgetful than usual? But at my age, that could be anything, right? I misplace my glasses three times a day, bless my heart. It's just… things. Not sure if that’s related to the blood pressure, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased forgetfulness. We'll keep that in mind. Now, do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were at those last two visits, or what the nurse said they were?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I don't. They just told me it was high-ish. I don't really pay attention to numbers, never have. Always leave that to the doctors and nurses. I just know it weren't good. Is that bad? I'm terrible with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, don't worry about the numbers. We’ll get a reading now and go from there. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never been told before. Always been healthy as a horse, 'til recently, that is. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old. My mama, she had some trouble with her heart when she got older, but that was a long time ago. Don't think this is the same thing, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior diagnosis of high blood pressure. And your mother had heart trouble… okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis. Keeps my hands from gettin' too stiff. It's… let me see… it's called Celebrex, I think. And sometimes a pain reliever if it flares up real bad. That's about it. I don't take a lot of pills, never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celebrex for arthritis, and pain relievers as needed. Any allergies to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I've been lucky that way, I suppose. Used to be able to eat anything, 'til my teeth started fallin' out. But that weren't an allergy, just old age again.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's get a quick check of your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Just so we have a baseline to work with. Can you roll up your sleeve for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing, doc. Go right ahead. Hope it ain’t too high. Makes me nervous, all this talk about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. First reading is… 162 over 94. A bit elevated. Let me take it again just to be sure. 165 over 96. Okay, consistently high. Your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, but not concerning at this point. Okay, Ms. Steines, we do need to address this blood pressure. It’s higher than we'd like.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See? I knew it. What does that mean, doc? Is it bad? I don’t want to end up in the hospital. My mama… she spent a lot of time in the hospital when she got older. What do we gotta do?
DOCTOR: Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It is something we need to take seriously, but it's manageable. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to problems, yes, but we’re going to work on getting it under control. It sounds like you might have what we call Stage 2 hypertension. Before we start any medication, I’d like to run a few tests just to make sure there aren't any underlying causes we need to investigate. We'll do a basic blood workup to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol. We'll also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I don’t like tests, but if you think it’s best. Whatever you think is right, doc. Just want to feel better again. My kidneys… are they alright? My brother, he had trouble with his kidneys. I don’t want nothin’ like that. How long will the tests take? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: No, the tests won't hurt a bit. The blood work is just a few vials of blood, and the EKG is completely painless - we just put some stickers on your chest and it records your heart's electrical activity. It only takes a few minutes. As for your kidneys, that's exactly why we're doing the blood work. We need to see if they're functioning properly. It’s good to be thorough. We’ll send the blood off to the lab, and it usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. Things like reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise… even just a short walk each day can make a difference. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Salt… oh, I love my salt. But I can try. I reckon I can cut back a little. And walkin’… I used to walk a lot, but my arthritis flares up sometimes. Fruits and vegetables… I like them alright. My daughter sends me a box every week. So, no pills right away? Just tryin’ to eat better and walk a little? That sounds… alright. Better than bein’ poked and prodded, that's for sure. When do I get the results back, doc? And who calls me?
DOCTOR: That’s right, no pills right away. We’ll see what the tests say first. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, on August 9th, to discuss the results. She’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available, and confirm the appointment time. She'll likely call around the 8th or 9th. If anything urgent comes up, she’ll call you sooner. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: August 9th… alright, I’ll mark it down. And the nurse… she’ll call me. Good. That's good. Hmm… let me see… what to ask… Oh! Will this mess up my arthritis medicine? I don't want my hands gettin’ all stiff again. It's awful when I can't button my clothes. And… is this somethin’ I got from my mama? Is high blood pressure somethin’ that runs in families?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. It’s possible, yes, high blood pressure can run in families, so it's good you brought that up. As for your arthritis medicine, it's unlikely to interact with any medication we might prescribe for your blood pressure, but we’ll double-check everything before you start anything new, just to be safe. And we’ll monitor your arthritis symptoms closely. Now, I'm going to give you a handout with information about lifestyle changes for high blood pressure, and a list of foods high in salt to avoid. Also, I'll send the results of the tests to your primary care doctor as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… thorough. Good. I like thorough. Handout… and sendin' it to the doctor. Yes, that's good. I reckon that's everything. I'm ready to go, if you are. Thank you, doc. You've been very helpful. Just hopin' this ain’t too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Steines. We're going to take things one step at a time, and we'll do everything we can to get your blood pressure under control. Remember, lifestyle changes can make a big difference. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's that handout, and the nurse will be with you shortly to schedule a follow-up and answer any other questions you may have. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
