DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… I work out on the tracks, fixing signals and switches, and it can be… stressful, you know? I was hoping to talk about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I’ve heard it can help with… well, just feeling calmer, generally.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sugino. It sounds like you’re proactively addressing some stress you’re experiencing related to your work. That’s excellent. Mindfulness and meditation can be very helpful tools. Before we delve into those specifically, could you tell me a little more about what that stress feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not like I panic, exactly. It's more… a constant sort of buzzing in my head. Like I’m always checking, re-checking… making sure everything is right. Even when I’m not at work, sometimes I find myself thinking about a switch, or a signal… just going over it and over it. It doesn't keep me up at night, but it’s… tiring. And sometimes I just feel… on edge, I suppose. Do you understand? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand, Ms. Sugino. That sounds like a form of persistent worry and rumination. It's quite common, especially in professions that require a high degree of responsibility and attention to detail. It’s good you’re recognizing it. To get a better picture, could you tell me how long you've been experiencing these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a good question. I suppose it’s gradually gotten worse over the last… five years, maybe? When I first started the job, I didn’t notice it at all. But as I got more experienced, and more responsible for… well, everything, it just started creeping in. It’s not like there was one specific event that triggered it. Just… a slow build-up, really. I remember a couple of close calls with equipment malfunctions, but I always managed to fix things before anything happened. But after those, I'd find myself thinking about it for days afterwards, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over five years, associated with increased responsibility and some stressful events at work. That’s helpful information. Have these feelings been impacting other areas of your life, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: Hmm… not… drastically. I still enjoy my hobbies. I like gardening, and I go to a folk dancing class once a week, which I really enjoy. And I keep in touch with my sister. But… I suppose I don't relax as much as I used to. I used to love reading, just losing myself in a book, but now… I find my mind wanders, even then. And sometimes I get… irritable, I guess. Not angry, exactly, but… short-tempered with people. Mostly just my sister, poor thing. It’s nothing major, but she’s noticed.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's subtly affecting your enjoyment of things and potentially your relationships, which is understandable. To get a more complete picture, let’s briefly go through a review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns – difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling unrested?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Actually, that's a good thing you asked. I do have trouble falling asleep sometimes. Not every night, but… often I find myself going over things in my head, replaying scenarios, even when I'm trying to sleep. And then I wake up a couple of times during the night, usually just to go to the bathroom, but then I find it hard to get back to sleep sometimes. I don't feel exhausted all the time, but… I don't feel as refreshed as I used to, definitely. I usually manage to get about six hours, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, with approximately six hours of sleep per night. And you said you don't feel fully rested. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat about the same as always. I enjoy cooking, so I usually make myself a nice dinner. And my weight… well, it’s pretty stable. Maybe a pound or two here or there, but nothing significant. I don’t diet or anything. I’m… a bit round, perhaps, but that’s just me. I’ve always been a bit of a comfort eater, to be honest. But it’s not like I’m bingeing or anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And are you experiencing any physical symptoms like headaches, muscle tension, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I get tension headaches. Not severe, but… a dull ache across my forehead, especially after a long day at work. And I do get muscle tension in my shoulders and neck. I think I just hold a lot of stress there. I haven’t noticed any stomach problems, though. No nausea or anything like that. I just… feel a bit stiff sometimes, that's all. It’s probably just from bending over the equipment all day, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Before we discuss potential strategies for managing stress, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, and I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, but that's about it. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I go for my regular check-ups, and my doctor always says my blood pressure is a little high, but she says it’s nothing to worry about… yet. She just tells me to watch my salt intake. But other than that, no, no major diagnoses. I have Medicare, so they keep a pretty good track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, fractured arm as a teenager, and slightly elevated blood pressure monitored by your primary care physician. And you said you have Medicare. Excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries, other than the tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: No, never. Just the tonsils, when I was little. My sister had her appendix out when she was younger, but I've always been lucky, thankfully. Never needed anything more serious than that. I’m a bit of a worrier, so I’m always careful, I suppose. I avoid risky activities. Mostly gardening and folk dancing, as I said. Not much chance of injury there!
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother had arthritis, pretty bad, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He died when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. My sister is healthy, thankfully. She’s very active – she does a lot of hiking. As far as I know, there’s no history of… mental health issues, or anything like that, in my family. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. Do you need to know more details? It’s been a long time, and I don’t remember everything perfectly.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Ms. Sugino. That gives me a good overview. And finally, regarding your social history – do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not at all. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, if I’m celebrating something special. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a bit of a… sensible person, I suppose. I like my gardening and my folk dancing, that’s enough excitement for me. I need a clear head for my job, you see. It’s important to be focused and alert when you’re working with signals and switches.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Sugino. That gives me a very good understanding of your background and current situation. Now, let's talk about your allergies and medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't have any food allergies, and I haven't ever had a reaction to any medication. My doctor prescribed me some painkillers a few years ago when I had a bad backache, and those were fine. Other than that, I don’t take any regular medications. Just a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. It's always cloudy where I live. I try to stay healthy and avoid getting sick, so I don't take much medicine.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, vitamin D supplement in the winter. Now, Ms. Sugino, based on what you’ve told me – the gradual onset of persistent worry related to your work, the difficulty relaxing, the tension headaches and muscle tension, and the intermittent sleep disturbance – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety, likely work-related. It’s important to emphasize that this is not a formal diagnosis at this stage, but a preliminary assessment based on our conversation. Would you be comfortable if I conducted a brief physical exam, just to rule out any other potential contributing factors?
PATIENT: Oh… anxiety, you say? Well, I suppose I have been feeling more… on edge lately. It’s not like I’m panicking, but… yes, that sounds about right. I just thought I was… stressed. A physical exam… yes, that’s fine. If it will help, then please do. I haven’t had one in a while, to be honest. I tend to avoid doctors if I can. But if you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand your reluctance, and we'll keep it brief. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to feel your neck… any tenderness or lumps?
PATIENT: No, that feels fine. Not at all tender. My sister always tells me I have tense shoulders, but my neck feels okay. I sometimes get a bit of stiffness there after a long day at work, but nothing major. I suppose it’s just from bending over the equipment all day, like I said. It’s not usually painful, just a bit… tight.
DOCTOR: Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… please relax your arm… Good. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Sugino. Everything appears normal on the brief physical exam. This doesn't rule anything out entirely, but it makes a primary psychological cause more likely, as you suspected. Now, before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to ask a couple of clarifying questions about your work. Can you describe a typical stressful situation you encounter at your job?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? Well, sometimes equipment malfunctions, and it's my job to fix it, quickly. That’s stressful, because if I don’t fix it fast enough, it could cause delays, or even… accidents. And the responsibility is… significant. It's not like it happens often, thankfully. But when it does, I feel… a lot of pressure. It’s not the physical work, it's the… what if something goes wrong? It’s hard to explain. I’ve been doing it for so long, but the worry doesn’t really go away.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly stressful, Ms. Sugino. The weight of responsibility, and the potential consequences of a malfunction… that would understandably cause anxiety. Now, do you have any control over how these malfunctions are addressed?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I mean, I do have the training and the expertise to fix them. And my supervisor trusts me to handle them. But sometimes… things are more complicated than they seem. Maybe a piece of equipment is old and unreliable, and I know it’s going to cause problems again. Or maybe there’s a shortage of spare parts, so I have to improvise. In those situations, I feel… less in control. Like I’m just putting a band-aid on a bigger problem. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I like to do a good job, and I want everything to be safe and reliable. But sometimes… it’s just out of my hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sugino. You have the expertise but sometimes lack control over the circumstances, leading to frustration and worry. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the lack of any significant physical findings, I believe you are experiencing work-related anxiety, potentially with some elements of obsessive thinking regarding potential malfunctions. Now, we have several options we can explore. We could discuss lifestyle modifications, like mindfulness techniques and relaxation exercises, as you mentioned. We could also consider short-term therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, to help you develop coping strategies for managing your anxiety and challenging negative thought patterns. In some cases, medication can be helpful, but I generally prefer to start with non-pharmacological approaches. What are your initial thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Hmm… therapy and mindfulness… those both sound good, actually. I was hoping you’d say something like that. I’m a bit hesitant about medication, if I can avoid it. I like the idea of learning techniques to manage the anxiety myself, rather than just… masking it with a pill. I suppose I’m a bit worried about what therapy would involve, to be honest. I’ve never been to therapy before. What would it be like? And how long would it take? I’m worried about taking too much time away from work. I don't want to fall behind.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable concern, Ms. Sugino. Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a very practical, problem-focused approach. It typically involves weekly sessions, usually lasting around 50 minutes. In the sessions, we would explore the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to your anxiety, and develop strategies for challenging negative thought patterns and coping with stressful situations. It's not about dwelling on the past, but about learning skills to manage your anxiety in the present. The duration of therapy varies depending on your individual needs, but a typical course might be 8-12 sessions. We can discuss flexible scheduling options to minimize disruption to your work. I can provide you with a referral to a qualified therapist in the area, and we can talk more about what to expect during the initial consultation. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable, actually. 8-12 sessions… I could probably fit that in. And a referral to a therapist… yes, please. I suppose I’m a bit nervous, but I’m also relieved to have a plan. It’s nice to know there are things I can do to address this. Thank you, Dr. Rakosky. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm glad we were able to develop a plan that feels comfortable for you. I’m going to write out a referral for a couple of therapists who specialize in CBT and are conveniently located near you. I’ll also give you some resources on mindfulness techniques and relaxation exercises that you can start exploring in the meantime. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. The referral and the resources are perfect. Thank you again, Dr. Rakosky. I feel much better, just having talked about it and knowing there's help available. I'll give the therapists a call and see what their availability is like. I appreciate your time and your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. Remember, it takes courage to seek help, and you’ve already taken the first step. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you all the best. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. And remember to breathe.
