DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Um… well, it’s… going to the toilet. It’s hard now. Not… not easy like it used to be. I gotta… push a lot. It’s been like that for a little while, I think. Maybe a few weeks? I don’t really keep track so well anymore.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And is it… difficult every time, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly every time. Not always super hard, but… I gotta think about it, you know? And sometimes it takes a long time. Longer than it used to. My husband, he helps me sometimes, but… well, he's getting older too. It’s just… bothersome, mostly. Not painful, just… hard. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no pain, just… straining and taking longer than usual. Have you noticed any changes in your stool itself?
PATIENT: Oh, stool? Is that… what comes out? Well, it looks… normal, I guess. Brown. Maybe a little… thinner sometimes? But I don’t pay much attention to that part, if I’m honest. I mostly just want it to go easier, you know? Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, dear. Don't worry about it. Thinner sometimes is good to know. Now, have you been feeling completely empty after going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Empty? Well… I feel like I’ve gone, yes. But sometimes… sometimes I feel like there’s still a little bit left. Not much, just… a little feeling. Is that what you mean? It’s hard to describe. Like it doesn’t all come out, even when I push. It’s probably nothing, I just thought I'd mention it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood when you wipe, or in the toilet bowl?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… I don't think so. Not that I’ve seen. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you know? I try not to look too closely. My husband, he would tell me if there was something, I think. He’s very… observant. But no, I haven't noticed any blood. Not recently. I hope not! That sounds… bad.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now, are you drinking enough fluids throughout the day?
PATIENT: Fluids… Well, I have my tea. Every morning, and sometimes in the afternoon. And my husband makes me drink water, he worries about me getting dehydrated. I don’t really feel thirsty, if that makes sense. I used to drink more water when I was younger, but… I don't know, I just don't seem to need it as much anymore. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Probably not enough, dear. Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look. Just a simple examination, if you don't mind. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Lie down? I… I don't really like lying down. My back isn't very good, you know? Is there… is there another way? I can tell you about my aches and pains, I’m very familiar with them. But lying down… I don’t know… It’s just a little uncomfortable. Maybe we could talk a bit longer first?
DOCTOR: Very well. We can talk a bit longer. Have you been experiencing any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, goodness… I don’t think so. My clothes… they fit about the same, I guess. My husband says I’m looking a little thin, but he always says that. He worries too much. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, if that makes a difference. Eating is… fine. Not as much as I used to, maybe, but nothing drastic. I enjoy my tea and biscuits, you know. Do you need me to step on a scale? I don't mind, if it helps.
DOCTOR: No, no. Let's just move on. What about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Diet? Well, I eat. Mostly… what my husband makes. He's a good cook. We have fish sometimes, and chicken. Vegetables… when he buys them. I like potatoes. And I have my biscuits with my tea, of course. Not a lot of fancy things, you know. Just… normal food. I don't really worry about what I eat, to be honest. It all tastes the same to me these days. Does that answer your question? I'm not very good at this, am I?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no major dietary changes, normal appetite… Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a long time ago. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis is bad, I take something for that. It helps a bit. My husband helps me keep track of it all, he’s very organized. I don't remember the names, though. Sorry. It’s a lot to keep track of when you're old, you know? Does that help?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, arthritis medication... Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. My husband says I’m very lucky. I used to get hay fever when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. I don’t really go outside much anymore. So, no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I hope not! It’s hard to remember things, you know? Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, no, it's alright. Alright, let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. You mentioned difficulty with complete evacuation and straining. And it’s been happening for a few weeks. I'm thinking this could be constipation. It's very common. But to be certain, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to do a quick abdominal exam. It won't be unpleasant.
PATIENT: Constipation? Oh. Well, that sounds… sensible. It feels like something’s stuck, sometimes. But an exam… I really don’t like being touched, dear. My husband always says I’m very sensitive. Is it really necessary? Could we not… try something else first? Maybe a different kind of tea? Or a different pill? I don't know… I just don't like being poked and prodded, you know? It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, dear. I understand you're anxious. But to properly assess what’s going on, I need to listen to your abdomen, and feel gently for any abnormalities. It will be very quick. It’s important. If it helps, I can explain exactly what I'm doing as I go along. But I really need to do this to make sure everything is alright. We can talk about different teas and pills after I’ve had a chance to listen to your tummy. What do you say?
PATIENT: … Alright. But please be gentle. And… and explain everything, like you said. And if it hurts, I want you to stop. Promise? My husband always says I’m a bit of a worrier, and he’s probably right. Just… be gentle, dear. And tell me what you're doing. That will make me feel better. I… I suppose I trust you. But please be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, dear. I promise. I'll be very gentle, and I'll explain everything as I go. Just lie back on the examination table, and we'll get this done quickly. Alright, let's start. I'm just going to listen to your tummy with this stethoscope. It doesn't hurt at all, it just helps me listen for any unusual sounds. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: That's cold. Is that… is that normal? It feels… strange. And I feel a bit silly lying here like this. My husband wouldn’t like this, he always says I need to be dignified. Please hurry, dear. It makes me a bit nervous, you know? Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Just breathing normally, dear. In and out. Alright. Everything sounds… normal so far. Now, I'm just going to press gently here. Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh, that tickles! And it’s… a bit firm, isn’t it? It feels… harder than usual, I think. Like… like there’s a bit of a lump. But maybe that’s just my tummy, you know? I’ve always been a bit… rounded. Is that bad? It’s just… strange feeling. I don’t like being touched, you know? It makes me feel… vulnerable. Please be careful, dear. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is a little firm. And I can feel a bit of… fullness. It's not necessarily concerning, but it’s good to be aware of it. Alright. I think that's enough for now. We’ll see what the next step is. Just sit up slowly.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That didn’t feel right, you know? It feels… sore now. And… and a bit wobbly. I think I need to sit down. Is something wrong? You looked… worried when you touched me. Is it something serious? Please tell me, dear. I don’t like being kept in the dark, you know? It makes me anxious. I think I need my husband.
DOCTOR: Alright, dear. Let's not jump to conclusions. It’s possible this is just a bit of constipation, as we discussed. However, given the firmness I felt, and to rule out anything more serious, I’m going to order a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. We'll also need to do a blood test to rule out infection. I'm also going to refer you to a gastroenterologist for a more thorough evaluation. They're the specialists in this area, and they can perform further tests, such as a colonoscopy, if needed. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, dear. It’s just a precaution. We're being thorough. I'll have the lab forms printed out for you. And I'll schedule the referral to the gastroenterologist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… a colonoscopy? What’s that? That sounds… frightening. And blood tests? Oh, dear. My husband won't like this, he worries so much. Is it something bad? You're not telling me something, are you? Please, dear, just tell me straight. Is it… is it cancer? I just want to know the truth, you know? Even if it's bad. I don't like secrets. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, dear. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we look at the inside of your colon to check for any abnormalities. It's the most accurate way to diagnose what's going on. And the blood tests will just help rule out any infection. There is a possibility of something more serious, yes. But it’s too early to say anything definitively. We need to get the results of these tests before we can know for sure. It could be a polyp, which is usually benign, or it could be something else. I understand you're worried, and I’m here to support you. But jumping to conclusions won't help. Let's take it one step at a time. I'll have the lab forms ready for you, and I'll schedule that referral to the gastroenterologist as soon as possible. I'll also give you a list of resources for support. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I don't think I can do this. It's all too much. My husband… he’ll be so worried. He’s not strong like me. Could we… could we just wait? Maybe it will go away on its own? I don't want any tests. I don't want to know. I just want to go home. Please, dear. Please just let me go home.
DOCTOR: Alright, dear. I understand you're upset. But waiting isn't an option. We need to get this checked out. It's for your own health. Look, I'll call your husband, and we can discuss this together. Perhaps having him here will help. And I'll write a note for him, explaining everything. Here are the forms for the lab. And I'll have my nurse schedule you an appointment with the gastroenterologist. I really urge you to follow through with this, dear. It's important. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
