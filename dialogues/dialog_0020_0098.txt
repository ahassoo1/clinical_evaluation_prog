DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I guess I'm just... checking things out. Been meaning to find a doctor around here since I moved. Just wanted to see what’s what, you know? No real problems, nothin' urgent.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s a very good idea – preventative care is important. Even without specific concerns, it's good to get a baseline and establish a relationship with a doctor. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about why you decided to come in now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my ex-wife... she always kept on me about going to the doctor. Said I needed to be more careful. And honestly, I been feelin' kinda run down lately, just tired all the time. Thought maybe it was time to check it out. Not a big deal, probably just work. Lots of heavy lifting on the boats.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Feeling run down, especially with physical work… that's definitely something we should look into. And it’s good you’re prioritizing this now. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree. Had it set, all healed up fine. Other than that... nothin' major. Just the usual colds and stuff, you know? Never been in the hospital except for that arm thing. I don't really get sick much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No major hospitalizations or serious illnesses. And you said the broken arm healed completely with no lasting problems?
PATIENT: Yeah, it healed up real good. Doctor said it was a clean break, and it never bothered me after the cast came off. Played football after that, everything. No pain, no problems. Just a scar, but that's about it. It was… a long time ago, though. Maybe when I was eight? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Eight years old… alright. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm. My mom… she's got high blood pressure, takes pills for it. My dad… he passed away a few years back. He had… I think it was something with his heart, but I wasn't really close to him, so I don’t know a whole lot about it. No brothers or sisters, just me. I don’t really have much family around here, not anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. Okay, your mom with high blood pressure, and your father… heart issues. Do you know if anyone else in the family had any health problems – grandparents, aunts, uncles?
PATIENT: Not really. My grandma on my mom’s side lived to be pretty old, I think. Like, ninety-something? She just… got old, you know? Didn’t really get sick or nothin’. My other grandparents… I didn't really know them very well. Mom didn’t talk about ‘em much. I wish I knew more, honestly. It’s kinda hard thinkin' back now.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. It's common not to have a complete picture of family history. We can work with what you do know. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Don't smoke, never have. I might have a beer every now and then, like at a barbecue, but nothin' regular. And definitely no drugs. Not my thing. I try to stay pretty clean, ya know? Work’s hard enough without addin’ stuff like that into the mix. Mostly just water and coffee to get through the day.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, when it’s really achin’ from liftin’. But it’s not every day, just when I need it. Otherwise, nothin'. I try to avoid takin' pills whenever I can. Mostly just try to rest when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain. That’s good to know. Now, just to finish up with the basics, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Mom always said I was lucky that way. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t ever had trouble with any medicine when I’ve taken it. I think… I don't really have allergies. I’ve never had to worry about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. So, no known allergies, no current medications, you drink alcohol occasionally, no smoking, and just ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Alright. Now, I think it would be a good idea to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if we can figure out what might be causing your tiredness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just wanna figure out what's goin' on. Tiredness is gettin’ old, ya know? I'm ready when you are. Just let me know what I gotta do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. After that, I'll palpate your abdomen, and finally, I’ll check your reflexes and neurological function. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. If you don’t mind, please have a seat on the table and loosen your shirt. We'll start with your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. No problem. Go ahead, Doctor. Just let me know if I gotta do anything special. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles auscultated. Respiratory effort appears normal. Okay, everything sounds good so far with your heart and lungs. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Please open your mouth wide and say "Ahhh."
PATIENT: Ahhhh… is that good? Feel free to poke around, Doctor. I don’t mind. I’m tryin’ to stay relaxed here.
DOCTOR: Throat appears clear, no erythema or exudate. Tympanic membranes are normal bilaterally. Nasal passages are clear, no congestion or polyps noted. Okay, everything looks good in your throat, ears and nose as well. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’ll start on your upper abdomen, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if anything hurts, right? That’s what you said. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender to palpation. No guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. No palpable masses or organomegaly detected. Okay, your abdomen feels normal as well. Now, just a few quick neurological checks. I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… normal, I guess. Tap away, Doctor. Don’t be gentle, if you gotta be. I’m just layin’ here.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, equal and symmetric. Okay, reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Please just look at my finger and don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Yeah, I see it. Followin’ it… is that good? Feels kinda weird lookin’ back and forth like this. Is it all done now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Eye movements are full and smooth bilaterally, no nystagmus or limitations noted. Yes, that’s all done now. Everything appears normal with the physical exam. Based on the history and physical, it’s difficult to pinpoint the cause of your fatigue. It could be a number of things – stress, lack of sleep, mild dehydration, or even an early viral illness. However, given your age and general health, I'd like to order a few routine blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as anemia, thyroid issues, or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Blood tests sound smart. I mean, I don't wanna just ignore it, ya know? If there's somethin' wrong, I wanna know. So yeah, let’s do the blood tests. When do I gotta come back? And where do I go for ‘em?
DOCTOR: Great. I’m ordering a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. You can get these tests done at the lab across the street – it’s called Rural Medical Labs. They take walk-ins, but it’s best to go in the morning, before you’ve eaten. I’ve written the hours on the form. Once you have the results, you can either have them faxed directly to my office – the fax number is on the form as well – or you can schedule another appointment to go over them with me. It usually takes about a week to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, getting adequate sleep, and managing your stress levels. If your fatigue worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or muscle aches, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds good, Doctor. Rural Medical Labs… got it. I’ll try to get there tomorrow morning, first thing. And I’ll keep an eye on things, make sure nothin’ gets worse. Thank you for lookin’ me over, Doctor Beinborn. I appreciate it. Is there anything else I gotta do, or are we all set for now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. No, I think we're all set for now. Just remember to stay hydrated, get some rest, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Here's a copy of the lab requisition form and a summary of today's visit for your records. If you have any questions before your next appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Okay, great. Thank you again, Doctor. You too. .
