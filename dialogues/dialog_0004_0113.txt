DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Deschane, you say? Hmm. Well, it's… it's my waterworks, mostly. Been going a lot lately. Just… a lot. It's a nuisance, really. Wakes me up at night, you know? Not how a man should be spending his twilight years, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. And how long has this “a lot” been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… time slips away, doesn't it? Let me think… a few months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. It wasn’t sudden, just… gradually more and more. My wife, bless her heart, she's the one who really noticed it first. I tend not to pay attention to these things, myself. More important things to worry about, you know? Like the state of the garden.
DOCTOR: More frequent urination for several months. Do you find yourself needing to go during the day as well, or is it primarily a nighttime issue?
PATIENT: Both, I suppose. But nighttime is… bothersome. Disrupts my sleep. During the day, I can usually manage. Though, I find myself… planning things around it, if that makes sense? Knowing where the nearest… facilities are. It’s not dignified, Doctor. A man shouldn’t have to plan around his bladder.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no, not really. A little discomfort, maybe, but nothing I’d call pain. It’s not… sharp. Just… a bit of a weak stream, sometimes. Like the faucet isn’t fully open, you know? And it takes a moment to get going.
DOCTOR: Hesitancy and a weak stream… alright. Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder each time, or do you feel like there’s still some left over?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm... often, no. I don’t. I feel like there’s… a little left behind, always. I have to go back again fairly quickly, sometimes. It’s… frustrating. You feel like you've just gone, and then... not quite.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Now you're asking me things… I haven't been studying my urine, Doctor! It looks like… pee. Yellowish, mostly. Maybe darker sometimes. Is it supposed to be a certain color? Honestly, I’ve never paid much attention to it. I drink my tea, and… well, it ends up where it ends up.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll move on. Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… high blood pressure, the doctor said, years ago. Put me on a little pill for it, I take it every day. And my knees, they ache something awful. Arthritis, they call it. Besides that… nothing I can recall. I’m an old man, Doctor, a few aches and pains are to be expected. I try to keep myself moving, but it's getting harder, you know?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis. Any family history of kidney problems, bladder issues, or prostate cancer?
PATIENT: Prostate… cancer? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Let me think… My brother, God rest his soul, he had… some kind of trouble with his plumbing, way back when. Not sure what exactly. And my father… well, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. Didn't talk about such things. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a family for sharing… details.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you currently take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one, as far as I recall. My wife handles most of that, bless her. She’s very organized. Sometimes she gives me a little something for my knees when they're particularly bad, some kind of cream, I suppose. But that's it. I don't like taking a lot of pills, makes me feel… sluggish. I prefer a good cup of tea, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better understanding of things. We’ll check your abdomen, and I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam. It’s standard procedure, and will give me some information about the size and condition of your prostate. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it's important. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh. That kind of exam? Goodness. Well, I… I don’t particularly like the sound of that. It sounds… invasive. But, I suppose if you say it’s important… I’ve always been one to listen to the doctor. Though, I must say, it’s not something I was looking forward to. My wife always tells me I’m a bit sensitive in that area.
DOCTOR: It is a standard procedure, Mr. Segretto. And sensitivity is not uncommon. Please lie on your side on the examination table, and we’ll get this over with quickly. I'll let you know what I'm doing as I go.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… be gentle, please. And don't take too long. My knees aren't what they used to be, getting up and down is a challenge.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your prostate is somewhat enlarged, and there is some smoothness to the gland. It's not acutely tender, but it’s definitely not normal. I'm going to order a urinalysis to check for infection and blood, and a PSA test to get a baseline measurement of your prostate-specific antigen. Based on what you've told me and my examination, you likely have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s an enlarged prostate, and it’s common in men your age. However, the smoothness I felt warrants further investigation to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Benign… what now? It sounds complicated. And “further investigation”? What does that entail? More poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. I just wanted someone to tell me why I have to go to the bathroom so much, not… a whole battery of tests and strange medical terms.
DOCTOR: Benign prostatic hyperplasia simply means your prostate is enlarged, which is causing your urinary symptoms. The PSA test is a blood test, no “poking and prodding” involved. It measures a protein produced by the prostate. An elevated level could indicate a possible infection, inflammation, or even cancer. We need that information to determine the next step. It's important to be thorough, Mr. Segretto. Ignoring this could have serious consequences. We’re ruling things out, not necessarily confirming anything. I’m going to schedule you for a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you limit your fluid intake before bedtime and avoid caffeine. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Limit fluids… avoid caffeine? Doctor, those are two of life’s greatest pleasures! But… alright, I suppose I can try. Is it… is it likely to be… serious? Cancer, you said? My brother… he didn't fare well, if I recall correctly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, it’s far too early to say anything definitive. The vast majority of elevated PSAs are due to benign causes. We're simply being cautious and gathering information. Worrying yourself before we have the results won’t do any good. Here is the order for your blood work and urinalysis. The lab is just down the hall. Once you’ve completed the tests, you can schedule your follow-up appointment with the receptionist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Urinalysis… PSA test… alright, alright. Down the hall, you say? Yes, I… I think so. Limit fluids, avoid caffeine, go down the hall… It’s a lot to take in, Doctor. I do wish things were simpler. Thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. If you experience any fever, chills, or inability to urinate, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: Alright. Fever, chills… yes, alright. I'll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor. I think I need a cup of tea.
