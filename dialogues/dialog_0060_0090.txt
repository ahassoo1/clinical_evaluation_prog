DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe it has to do with a surgery I’m hoping to have. My… husband’s family helped me schedule this visit, a clearance, I think they called it? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s… difficult to recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: A surgical clearance, right. Okay. Well, let’s start with the basics. What kind of surgery are you hoping to have?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a clearance. It’s… cosmetic, I understand. Something to do with… well, to improve my appearance. It was my husband’s wish, truly. He… he always wanted me to feel more confident. I don’t recall the exact name of the procedure, unfortunately. It involved… the stomach, perhaps? And the arms? It’s all rather blurry, I’m sorry. I’m trusting his family’s judgment on the details.
DOCTOR: So, it's a body contouring procedure, then – likely a tummy tuck and arm lift. And your husband's family arranged this visit for pre-operative evaluation. I see. It's good they're being thorough. Now, Ms. Brightful, while I appreciate your trust in them, you need to be able to discuss this with me. Do you understand what a tummy tuck and arm lift entail, generally?
PATIENT: A tummy tuck… and arm lift… I’ve heard those names, I think. But I… I don’t recall the specifics, no. My husband did most of the research, and he explained everything to me. I just… agreed. He was very persuasive, and wanted me to be happy. I suppose I assumed it was safe, given his thoroughness. Is it… is it a major surgery? I feel foolish admitting I don't know the details.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal that you’re going into this without a full understanding of the procedure, Ms. Brightful. It is major surgery. Both a tummy tuck and arm lift involve significant incisions, anesthesia, and a recovery period. We need to establish that you're a suitable candidate, and that you are aware of the risks and benefits. Before we proceed, let's go through your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… yes. A few times. It was… after my husband passed. I… I wasn’t myself, and I had a difficult time coping. I remember… a stay for severe anxiety and… depression. And before that… a brief stay when I broke my wrist, many years ago. I don't recall the names of the hospitals or doctors, if that’s important. Everything feels… distant. I’m taking medication for anxiety still, if that helps. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Anxiety and depression are important, Ms. Brightful. And the fact that you're currently medicated is crucial information. We need to assess how well controlled your anxiety is, and whether it will impact your surgical recovery. What medication are you taking for your anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… It’s a small, white pill. I believe… Sertraline? Yes, that sounds right. It’s 50 milligrams, I think. I've been on it for… almost a year now. It helps, mostly. I still have bad days, but it’s… manageable. My primary care physician handles it. I don't remember her name, unfortunately. I apologize. This is all so frustrating. I feel like I’m failing some sort of test.
DOCTOR: Sertraline, 50mg daily. Okay. And you said a history of severe anxiety and depression after your husband passed away. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It… it was very difficult. He was my everything. We were married for twenty-five years. After he passed… I just… couldn’t function. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I lost all interest in everything. I was seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, but it took a long time to get better. I had thoughts… bad thoughts. The medication and therapy helped, but it still… lingers. It's hard to explain. It's like a shadow that follows me. I'm afraid of… falling back into that place. Is that… concerning for the surgery?
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, it is concerning. A history of severe depression, coupled with ongoing anxiety, increases your risk of complications after surgery. Emotional well-being is critical for healing, and surgery can be a significant stressor. We need to be certain you’re in a stable place, both mentally and physically, before even considering proceeding. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: I… I do. My doctor told me I have slightly high blood pressure. I take a small pill for that as well, every morning. Lisinopril, I believe. 10 milligrams. And… I sometimes have trouble with my cholesterol, but it's not too bad. I try to eat healthy, but… it's difficult. It feels like there's always something. I just want to feel… normal again. Do you think… is this still possible?
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, with all due respect, right now, the focus needs to be on optimizing your overall health, not elective cosmetic surgery. Your blood pressure needs to be controlled, your cholesterol managed, and most importantly, your mental health needs to be stable. We need a referral to your primary care physician for a full evaluation, and potentially a consultation with a psychiatrist to assess your suitability for surgery. I will not clear you for a procedure until these issues are addressed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I understand. It’s… disappointing. But… if that’s what’s best… then I suppose I should do it. It’s just… his family is so eager. They keep talking about how happy it will make me. I just want to please them. But… I also don't want to risk my health. A referral to my primary care physician… and a psychiatrist… yes. Please. Can you help me with that? I'm just so confused. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Brightful. I’m happy to help. I’m going to write down the names of a few excellent primary care physicians and psychiatrists in the area. It’s important that you see someone you trust, someone who can provide comprehensive care. It's also vital that you are making these decisions for yourself. We can discuss this further after you’ve had a chance to consult with these specialists. We need to prioritize your wellbeing. Here are a few names. Please call their offices and schedule appointments as soon as possible. I’ll also send a summary of our consultation to your current insurance provider. Remember, taking care of your health is the most important thing. .
