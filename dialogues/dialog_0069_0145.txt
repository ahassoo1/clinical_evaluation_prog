DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I need to… how you say… get a paper signed, yes? For help at home. My daughter, she explained it. Something about being sure I qualify for assistance. She said you are the one who does this. It is for home health, I believe. Or maybe… hospice? She used both words.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re needing documentation to help facilitate home health services, and perhaps your daughter is exploring all options, including hospice, to ensure you have the support you need. That’s very proactive of both of you. To best help you with this, and to determine what level of assistance is appropriate, let's talk a little bit about what's been going on with your health. Could you tell me a bit about what's been making it difficult for you at home?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Difficulties. Well, I had a surgery, you see. On my… abdomen. It was… last month, the 12th of July, to be precise. It did not go as planned, and now… it is hard to move quickly. And it hurts, of course. Lifting things… impossible. My daughter, bless her heart, does much of the housework now. But she has a job, and a family. It is… a burden, I think. I wish to not be a burden. That is why we are here, yes? To see if help is possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 12th, abdominal surgery. And you’re experiencing pain and difficulty with mobility and lifting, understandably. It's good you’re thinking about getting some extra support. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… a sharp pain, mostly. Around the incision, naturally. It comes and goes, but even when it is not sharp, there is a dull ache. It is worse when I try to stand, or walk. And if I… strain myself, even a little, it is very bad indeed. I take medication, of course. My daughter manages this as well. Two pills, three times a day. But it does not always help, you see. Sometimes it is… simply there, no matter what.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain around the incision, with a constant dull ache that worsens with movement. And the pain medication isn’t providing complete relief. Do you know what the medication is that you’re taking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My daughter fills the prescription. It is a small, white pill. I believe… she said it begins with a ‘V’. Vicodin, perhaps? Is that correct? Or something similar. I am not very good with remembering names, you understand. But it is white, and small. And it helps, sometimes. But not enough, as I said.
DOCTOR: Vicodin, okay. That's a common pain medication post-surgery. It sounds like it's helping somewhat, but not providing full relief, which is important to address. Aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see. Well, I tire very easily, yes. Even walking across the room leaves me breathless. And my appetite… it is not very good. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… everything tastes bland. And I have… trouble sleeping. I wake up several times during the night. Just small things, really. But they add up, you see. It is… wearing me down. Also, my daughter says I have lost weight. I have not weighed myself, but she tells me.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, and weight loss. Those are all things we need to consider. Now, before we move forward, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I have… nothing major, to be honest. High blood pressure, for many years. But it is controlled with medication. And… arthritis, in my knees. It is an old man’s ailment, you understand. Nothing serious. I have never had any major illnesses, or surgeries… until this one, of course. I do not smoke, and I drink only… a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. My mother, she had diabetes, but I have never been tested for it. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so hypertension managed with medication, and arthritis. That's helpful to know. And yes, given your mother’s history of diabetes, it would be a good idea to check your blood sugar levels. We can do that quickly here today. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Vicodin and the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. There is… a small pill for my knees. It helps with the pain, but it is not very strong. I believe it is called… Celebrex? Yes, Celebrex. And sometimes, when I cannot sleep, my daughter gives me something. A small, blue pill. I do not know the name. She says it is… temporary. Just to help me rest. That is all, I believe. I try not to take too much, you understand. I do not want to become dependent on anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celebrex for your knees and the blue pill for sleep. It’s good you’re mindful of taking only what you need. Do you happen to know when you started taking Celebrex?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. That one I remember. My doctor prescribed it… oh, about two years ago, I think. It was getting difficult to walk, even short distances. He said it would help with the inflammation. And it does, a little. But it is not a miracle cure, you understand. It just… takes the edge off. I started taking it in… November, I believe. November of 2023. Yes, that is correct.
DOCTOR: Okay, November 2023. That's helpful. Now, regarding your family history, are there any other significant illnesses that run in your family besides your mother’s diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think carefully. My father, he had heart trouble. He had a… blockage, I believe. He had an operation, many years ago. And my sister, she had… cancer, unfortunately. Breast cancer. But she recovered, thankfully. She is quite well now. Other than that… nothing significant comes to mind. My grandparents… they lived long lives, both of them. But I do not recall any major illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your father and breast cancer in your sister. I’m glad to hear your sister recovered. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I used to be very active, you understand. I enjoyed gardening, and walking. But since the surgery… it is difficult. I mostly stay at home now. I read a lot. And I watch television. I live alone, you see. My wife… she passed away several years ago. I do not drive anymore. My daughter does the shopping, and other errands. I try to eat healthy, but my appetite is not very good, as I said. It is… a quiet life, you understand. Not very exciting. But it is… peaceful.
DOCTOR: I understand. A quiet life. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, Mr. Bahta. Now, before we do a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. None that I am aware of, anyway. I have never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks, of course, when she fills my prescriptions. And I always tell her, no allergies. It is… a blessing, I suppose. I have seen so many people suffer from allergies. But I have been fortunate. No, no allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is perfectly alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… want to feel better, you understand. And if this examination will help, then please, proceed. I will cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. I appreciate your cooperation. Alright, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back. There is mild tenderness to palpation around the surgical incision site. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly hypoactive. Does pressing here cause any particular discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Right… there. Just below my sternum. It is… a dull ache, but it is definitely worse when you press. It is not sharp, like the pain around the incision. But it is… unpleasant. It feels… swollen, almost. Not visibly, you understand. But that is the sensation. And yes, it is worse when I lie flat, I believe. It feels… compressed. That is the best way to describe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That location and the description of a dull ache with a sensation of compression are helpful. Now, I’d like to check your extremities for any swelling or changes in circulation. Can you point your toes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There is… a slight tingling sensation in my feet, Doctor. It is not painful, but it is… noticeable. Especially in my left foot. It comes and goes, you understand. But it is there, at times. It is… worrying, I suppose. But I have always had poor circulation, my daughter says. It is… a family trait, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay. Pulses are present, but slightly diminished bilaterally. There is some mild edema in both lower extremities, more pronounced on the left. The tingling sensation and diminished pulses are something we need to investigate further. Now, just a few more quick things. Can you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Slowly, of course. There we are. A little wobbly, but I am standing. It is… more difficult than it used to be, you understand. I have to be careful not to fall. And yes, my legs feel… weak. It is… a strange sensation. Like they are not supporting my weight properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is some mild unsteadiness. And yes, some weakness in the lower extremities. Alright, Mr. Bahta, thank you for your patience. That’s all for the physical exam. Now, based on our conversation and the exam findings, I have a better understanding of what’s going on. It sounds like you’re experiencing persistent pain and discomfort following your abdominal surgery. The tenderness around the incision site is expected, but the dull ache below your sternum, the mild edema, and the tingling sensation in your feet are concerning. The fatigue, decreased appetite, and sleep disturbance are also important to address. Based on this, I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We’ll also want to rule out any infection, so I'll order a urinalysis. Additionally, I'd like to get an EKG to assess your heart function, given your family history and the mild unsteadiness. Finally, we'll need an abdominal CT scan to evaluate the surgical site and rule out any complications. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. And yes, please, do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment, as I said. I just… want to know what is going on. And if these tests will help, then please, proceed. I understand it is a lot, but I want to get this sorted out. The sooner, the better, you understand. So, yes, please, order all of the tests you deem necessary. And let me know the results as soon as possible. I appreciate your… diligence, Doctor. Very much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bahta. I understand your concerns, and we’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lab should be able to accommodate you today. I'll have the nursing staff draw the blood now and get the EKG scheduled. We’ll get the CT scan ordered and scheduled as well. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever, a different one than the Vicodin, to help manage the discomfort. It's less addictive and may be better tolerated. I'll also recommend a physical therapist to help with your weakness and improve your balance. Once we have the results of the tests, we’ll discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. You have explained everything very clearly. I understand the tests, the medication, and the physical therapy. And I appreciate your… caution. It is good to know what to look for. Thank you for your time, Doctor Andraca. And thank you for listening. I feel… a little better already, just knowing what is going on. And I will, of course, follow your instructions carefully. So, no, I don't have any further questions at this time. What is the best way to follow up, Doctor? Do I call your office? Or will someone call me with the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. The nursing staff will call you within 24-48 hours to schedule the imaging tests. Once the results are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any urgent concerns before then. The number is 555-123-4567. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Bahta. And I’m here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. You have been… very helpful. And very kind. Thank you again. I believe that will be all for today. I will see you… when the results are available.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. The nursing staff will be in shortly to assist you. Have a good day.
