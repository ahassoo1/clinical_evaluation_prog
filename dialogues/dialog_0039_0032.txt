DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Krok. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… a rather delicate matter, you see. And frankly, a bit embarrassing for a man of my age to be discussing. It’s… something is leaking. Down there. It's been going on for… oh, I couldn't say precisely how long. A few weeks, perhaps? It's not… pleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It's perfectly alright. These things happen, and it's far more common than people realize. There's absolutely no need to be embarrassed. We’ll get to the bottom of it together. When you say "leaking," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. It’s… a discharge, I suppose. Not a gush, thankfully. More of a… dampness. And occasionally… a bit of… yellowish fluid. It stains my underclothes, you see. My wife, bless her heart, has noticed, of course. She suggested I come in. She’s always been the practical one. It's just… undignified. I haven’t had any pain, mind you. Just the… unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Okay, dampness and occasionally yellowish fluid, no pain. That’s helpful, thank you. And it's good your wife encouraged you to come in. Now, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me see… not that I recall. We’ve been rather quiet, actually. No…travel. The garden has been a bit of a bother with the weeds, but that's hardly relevant, is it? I suppose I have been… a little more tired lately. But at my age, one expects a bit of wear and tear, wouldn’t you agree, Doctor? I do take a nap most afternoons. And my appetite hasn't been what it used to be. But those are just… old age things, surely.
DOCTOR: Yes, those things can certainly be part of getting older. It’s good you’re noticing these changes. It’s important to consider everything. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? Hmm… now that you mention it… perhaps a little discomfort. A slight stinging, sometimes. Not every time, mind you. And it’s not…intense. I just put it down to the… quality of the water these days. Everything is so full of chemicals, isn't it? It can irritate things, I expect. A man can’t even drink a simple glass of water without worrying about what’s in it. Though, truthfully, my memory isn't what it used to be. I could have easily dismissed it. It's a small thing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight stinging with urination. Thank you for sharing that. That’s definitely important information. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any pain in your lower back or abdomen?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. I haven’t felt a fever in decades, thank goodness. Chills, either. We keep the house quite warm, you see. And my back… well, it aches a little, as a man’s back does at my age. But that's just the arthritis, I expect. I take some pills for it, you know. And no…no pain in my abdomen. Definitely not. I'm a fairly robust fellow, all things considered. It’s just this… leakage that's bothering me. It's rather embarrassing, as I said. Really quite undignified. Do you think it’s serious, Doctor? It's probably nothing, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Just the arthritis and the leakage. Mr. Krok, it's good you're generally feeling robust. While it might be nothing serious, the leakage and the stinging could indicate a urinary tract infection, or something else. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I would like to do a quick physical exam and collect a urine sample. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An…exam? Oh. Well. I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m not overly fond of doctors poking around. It's just… a matter of pride, you see. A man doesn't like being… examined. But if it's truly the only way to determine what's causing this… problem… very well. But please be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle, if you would be so kind. I haven’t had one of these in… well, a very long time. And the urine sample… where exactly am I supposed to…?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns completely. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I will step out of the room while you collect the urine sample to give you some privacy. There's a sterile cup in the bathroom, with instructions. Just follow those, and leave it on the counter when you're done. Then, I’ll need to do a brief examination of your abdomen and a genital exam. I'll explain everything as I go. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As long as you promise to be quick and gentle. And explain everything… thoroughly. I haven’t had much experience with… these procedures lately. It’s all rather unsettling, to be honest. A man prefers his privacy, you see. But if it’s for the best… very well. Just… please be mindful. And perhaps a little small talk to distract me? About the weather, perhaps? Or the garden? Anything to take my mind off… things. Now, where is this bathroom, exactly?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as we go. I can definitely chat about the weather or the garden – whatever helps to distract you. The bathroom is just to your right. I'll give you a few moments to collect the sample. When you're ready, just knock, and I’ll come back in.
