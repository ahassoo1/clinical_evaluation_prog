DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…rather embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve noticed…a bit of discharge. A gentleman’s problem, if you will, though it’s my problem currently. I haven’t the faintest idea what’s causing it, and frankly, I doubt it’s something I should be attempting to self-diagnose. It’s just…unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. Well, those things do happen, Ms. Wartick. It’s good you came in. Now, let's be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not entirely sure how specific one needs to be about such a delicate matter. It’s…coming from…down there. It’s not a pleasant sight, I assure you. Is there a…a scale for these things? Like, a little bit, a moderate amount, a flood? Because it’s certainly not a flood, but it’s not…nothing, either. And it's… yellowish, I suppose. Though color isn't my expertise.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wartick, there is a way to describe these things medically, which is rather more helpful than “a little bit” or “not nothing.” Yellowish discharge… alright. Is it associated with any odor?
PATIENT: Odor? Oh…yes. Now that you mention it…it’s not rotten, exactly. But it’s…distinct. Not a fragrance one would choose for oneself, certainly. It’s…fishy, perhaps? Though I haven’t been handling fish lately, so I wouldn’t know for certain. Is that…bad? It’s probably bad, isn't it? Everything sounds bad when one uses the word "discharge."
DOCTOR: Right. Fishy odor… that is suggestive. And is this a new development, Ms. Wartick, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s recent, Doctor. Very recent. Perhaps…a week? Maybe ten days? It started gradually, and I initially dismissed it as…well, a bit of sensitivity, perhaps. But it’s become more noticeable, and I decided it was best to seek professional advice. I'm not one to ignore things, you understand. Though, frankly, I’d rather be doing almost anything else right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ten days… and no other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. No pain, no burning, no…unusual itching. Just the discharge, and the rather unpleasant smell. I’ve been feeling otherwise perfectly well, thank you very much. A bit flustered, of course, having to discuss such things with a…a doctor. But otherwise, quite healthy. I do take my vitamins, you know. And I try to eat a balanced diet. Though the stress of this whole situation might be affecting my appetite.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick examination, Ms. Wartick. It's standard procedure, of course. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll just take a look and then we can discuss potential causes and a treatment plan. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Objections? Well… it’s hardly ideal, is it? But I suppose it’s necessary. I’ve never been one for…prodding and poking, if you will. But if that’s what it takes to determine the cause of this…unfortunate situation, then I suppose I have no choice. Just…be gentle, Doctor. And try to be quick about it, if you please. I have errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please lie down on your back with your knees bent. I'll explain everything as I go along.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, this paper is rather thin. And cold. Do you have a warmer sheet, Doctor? Perhaps one made of cotton? But never mind. Proceed when you are ready. Just…try not to take too long, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I'm just going to take a look… I see some slight redness and the discharge you mentioned. Now, I'm going to use a speculum to get a better look. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Just let me know if you feel any sharp discomfort.
PATIENT: A speculum? Oh dear. That sounds…intrusive. I’ve heard stories, you know. Are you absolutely certain it’s necessary, Doctor? Perhaps there’s another way? A swab, perhaps? Or a…a very powerful magnifying glass? I’m not comfortable with instruments, you understand. Not at all. And you say it shouldn’t be painful, but what if it is?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, a proper diagnosis requires a proper examination. I understand your discomfort, but a swab won’t provide the necessary information. And a magnifying glass…is not a substitute for medical instruments. It shouldn't be painful, but if you tense up, it will be more uncomfortable. I’ll be as gentle as possible, but I need to use a speculum to visualize the cervix. If you continue to resist, I'm afraid I can't accurately assess your condition. Now, can we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But you must promise me, Doctor, promise me, you will be exceedingly careful. And quick. I have a perfectly good life to get back to, you know. And frankly, I find this entire situation rather undignified. But if it’s absolutely necessary…proceed. But gently, Doctor. Gently.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. Just relax your muscles as much as possible. It will make things easier. I see some inflammation and the discharge is more significant than I initially thought. I'm going to take a swab to send to the lab for analysis. That will help us determine the cause of the infection. Just a quick swab, Ms. Wartick. Alright, that’s all done. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Honestly. The indignity of it all. One would think a simple ailment wouldn't require such…invasiveness. I do hope this analysis reveals something useful. Otherwise, this entire ordeal will have been for naught. And I’m not a young woman anymore, you know. These things take a toll.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. The swab is sent to the lab. We'll have results in a few days. Based on what I've seen, it’s likely you have a case of bacterial vaginosis or a sexually transmitted infection. We’ll know for certain once the lab results come back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic to cover both possibilities. I’ll also recommend avoiding sexual activity until we have the results and complete the treatment. Here’s the prescription for Metronidazole. Take it as directed, and finish the entire course, even if you start to feel better. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Metronidazole? Is that…strong? I do have a rather delicate constitution, you know. And avoiding sexual activity? Well, that’s…inconvenient. But if it’s necessary… I suppose I have no choice. And this bacterial…what was it? Vaginosis? Is that…serious? Will I need to inform anyone? And what if it is…one of those other things? The ones one doesn't speak of aloud? Oh dear. This is all very unsettling. And one more thing, Doctor. Will this antibiotic interact with my vitamins? I take a multivitamin, and a calcium supplement, and a little something for my eyesight. One must be careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick, let's go through this one step at a time. Metronidazole is a common antibiotic, and while it can have some side effects, they are usually mild – nausea, diarrhea, things like that. If you experience anything severe, contact me immediately. Bacterial vaginosis is not usually serious, but it's important to treat it to prevent complications. As for informing anyone… that is entirely your decision. If it is a sexually transmitted infection, it's important to inform any recent partners. Regarding your vitamins, Metronidazole can interact with certain supplements, including calcium. I recommend stopping the calcium supplement while you're on the antibiotic. You can continue with your multivitamin and eyesight supplement, but if you experience any unusual symptoms, discontinue them as well. Here's a sheet with more information about the antibiotic, including potential side effects and interactions. Read it carefully. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: "Metallic taste in mouth…" Oh dear. That doesn’t sound pleasant. And "abdominal cramping…" I’m prone to indigestion, you know. This is all very worrisome. One last thing, Doctor. And please forgive me for asking…is there anything I should be doing…down there? Aside from avoiding…activity, of course. Should I be douching? Washing with anything special? Or should I simply leave everything…alone? I’ve heard conflicting advice over the years, and I’m not sure what’s best. And…will this affect my…digestion? Long-term? I do enjoy my meals, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, absolutely do not douche. Douching disrupts the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and can actually make things worse. Wash with plain water only. No scented soaps, no feminine washes, nothing. Keep it simple. As for your digestion, long-term effects are unlikely. Some people experience temporary nausea or diarrhea while on the antibiotic, but those symptoms usually resolve once you finish the course. If you have persistent digestive issues, we can discuss it further, but I wouldn't worry about it at this stage. Look, I understand you’re anxious, but I’ve prescribed the appropriate treatment. Follow the instructions carefully, and we’ll reassess in a few days once the lab results are back. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I suppose that is all for now. Though I must say, this has been a rather unpleasant experience. And I do hope this antibiotic is effective. I have a garden party next week, you see, and I would very much like to be…presentable. Thank you for your…attention, Doctor. Though I confess, I still feel rather unsettled. But I shall follow your instructions to the letter. And if I experience any…unforeseen complications, I shall contact you immediately. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. Follow the instructions, and hopefully, we’ll have good news soon. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Good day.
PATIENT: .
