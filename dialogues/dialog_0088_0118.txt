DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Piet, you say? Hmm. Yes, well… something about a certification, I believe. It’s all rather… bureaucratic, isn’t it? Honestly, I can’t recall the specifics. It has to do with my… profession. Healthcare, something like that. I just need the paperwork signed, I presume.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I see here it’s for your recertification as an Emergency Medical Technician. Just to be thorough, even though you said it’s mostly paperwork, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your health since your last certification?
PATIENT: An Emergency… what was it? Yes, that sounds right. A great deal of responsibility, it was. Changes in my health… Well, I’m getting on, aren’t I? Sixty years… things ache a bit more than they used to, naturally. My hearing isn’t what it once was, I suppose. And my eyesight… well, let’s just say reading the small print is becoming a challenge. Is that what you meant? Honestly, I don’t recall any significant changes. It’s all just… the usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to get a better picture, could you describe any pain you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Pain… Oh, now you’re asking about pain. Really? Is this necessary? It’s a bit of a personal question, isn’t it? Very well. A dull ache in my lower back, mostly. Comes and goes. And occasionally a stiffness in my neck. Nothing debilitating, mind you. I’ve always been rather stoic, you see. I don't complain easily. It's just… age, I suppose. And perhaps a poorly designed chair. Is this going to delay the certification? I have other commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: No, this won't delay anything, Mr. Oriley. I just need to get a complete picture for the certification form. When did you first notice the back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you want dates? I haven’t the foggiest. Years, I should think. Perhaps… five years ago? Or maybe more. It comes and goes, as I said. It’s not a constant affliction. It started gradually, I believe. After… well, after a rather strenuous gardening session. I used to do a lot of gardening, you know. A very respectable hobby. I really can't pinpoint a specific date. It’s all a bit of a blur, frankly. Are we getting closer to the paperwork, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, five years ago sounds reasonable. And you mentioned stiffness in your neck - is that new, or has that been present for a while as well?
PATIENT: Now you're really testing my memory, Doctor. Stiffness… yes, I suppose it's relatively new. Within the last year, perhaps? It flares up occasionally, after sleeping in a strange position. Or if I spend too long reading. Though, as I said, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t do that much reading anymore. It’s… bothersome, certainly, but hardly a medical crisis. Honestly, I fail to see how this is relevant to a simple certification renewal. Is there a shorter form, perhaps? One that doesn’t require a detailed medical history?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Oriley. The certification form does require us to document a basic health assessment. It’s just a precaution. Now, besides the back and neck, have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Tingling? Really, Doctor. Are you suggesting I’m falling apart? I assure you, I’m perfectly capable. No, I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling. My hands are perfectly steady, thank you very much. I used to be quite skilled at… well, it doesn’t matter. The point is, I have full use of my limbs. It's all rather insulting, to be honest. A simple certification, and I’m being subjected to a full physical examination. Is this standard procedure? Because I must say, it seems rather excessive.
DOCTOR: It's just routine, Mr. Oriley. One last question regarding your systems – have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Now that is a remarkably personal question, Doctor. Are you quite sure this is necessary for a certification renewal? I mean, really! Bowel habits? Weight loss? I haven’t been keeping a ledger of my… digestive processes, if that's what you're asking. And as for weight loss, I might have lost a little weight, perhaps. But that's hardly a cause for alarm. I’ve been… watching my figure, shall we say. It's a matter of vanity, not illness. Honestly, I’m beginning to question the professionalism of this entire practice. Are we finished now? I have appointments to keep, you know. A man of my standing…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Just to complete the assessment, would you mind if I quickly checked your blood pressure and listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Heart and lungs? After all this… interrogation? Very well. But I must insist it be quick. I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, be gentle. I'm not a young man anymore. Though, I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy for my age. Just get it over with, Doctor. The sooner we’re finished, the sooner I can be on my way. Honestly, the bureaucracy of this entire process is… appalling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Your blood pressure is 140/90. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs. Do you have a history of asthma, COPD, or any other lung condition?
PATIENT: Crackles? In my lungs? Preposterous! I’ve never had any lung condition whatsoever. Asthma? COPD? Don’t be ridiculous. I used to spend summers hiking in the mountains, you know. Fresh air, vigorous exercise… perfectly healthy lungs. It must be a mistake. Perhaps the stethoscope is faulty? Honestly, Doctor, I find this… unsettling. Are you quite sure you're qualified for this position? This is sounding more and more like a misdiagnosis. I demand a second opinion! And frankly, I’m beginning to feel quite faint. All this… prodding and poking… it’s simply too much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your concern. The crackles are mild, but it’s always best to be thorough. To rule out anything serious, I recommend a chest X-ray. It’s a simple procedure, and it will give us a clearer picture of your lung health. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Now you want to radiate me? This is absolutely absurd! I came in for a simple certification renewal, and now I’m being subjected to a battery of tests and invasive procedures. Honestly, the incompetence of this entire establishment is… staggering. No, Doctor, I will not be undergoing a chest X-ray. I refuse. I'm perfectly healthy, as I've repeatedly stated. This is simply a waste of my time and a blatant attempt to inflate your billing practices. I demand to speak to your supervisor! And I want a full refund for this… sham examination. This is completely unacceptable. I'm leaving now. I expect a phone call regarding the refund. And I’m certainly not returning. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your frustration, but I must advise against leaving without addressing the findings. While I respect your decision, the crackles in your lungs could indicate a potential issue that requires further investigation. I am concerned for your health and strongly recommend you reconsider. However, if you insist on leaving, I will document your refusal of the recommended chest X-ray. Here is the form for your certification renewal. It is signed as complete based on the information you've provided. Please contact us if you change your mind regarding the X-ray. Have a good day, Mr. Oriley.
