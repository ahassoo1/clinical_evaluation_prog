DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Sobkowicz, good to see you. Though at 86, I suspect “good” is relative, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, yes. Get on with it, Doctor. I no have all day. My wife, she waiting in car. Very impatient woman. Chest… feels funny. Like bird flapping. And head… boom, boom. Blood pressure, you say? Is high. I know. They told me.
DOCTOR: Yes, your primary care physician did note elevated blood pressure. Alright, "funny" and "boom, boom" aren’t exactly helpful medical terms, Mr. Sobkowicz. Let’s try to be a little more specific. When did this "funny" feeling in your chest start?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. Doctor, you ask too many questions. Maybe… three, four days ago? I was… gardening. Pulling weeds. Hot day. Then… boom, boom. And then… funny. Is not rocket science. Old man, old heart. What you want from me?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know details, Mr. Sobkowicz. Gardening… okay. Was this a sudden pain, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually! Like… slow leak in tire. Not bang. Slow. And then… more. I stop gardening. Sit down. Wife, she yell. Always yelling.
DOCTOR: Alright. A gradual onset of… discomfort. And this discomfort, where exactly in your chest are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Here! Right… in middle. Not side. Middle! Like… someone sitting on my chest. Heavy. Is not good feeling. You understand? Heavy.
DOCTOR: Yes, “heavy” is… clearer. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But hurry. My wife… she make very good kimchi. I no want to miss dinner. Do quick, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breath in… and out… again… in… and out. Alright. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, thankfully. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure again, and then we’ll need to do a quick EKG just to be certain. Don’t get alarmed, it's just standard procedure.
PATIENT: EKG? What is EKG?! More tests? I told you, just old man! Old heart! What will EKG tell you that listening with… that thing… doesn't? My wife, she say I waste money on doctors. Is she right?
DOCTOR: An EKG, Mr. Sobkowicz, is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It can tell us if there’s any irregularity or damage we can’t hear with a stethoscope. And frankly, dismissing symptoms simply because of your age is… irresponsible medicine. It doesn’t confirm anything, it simply gives us more information. Now, if you'll allow the nurse to attach a few stickers to your chest… it won’t take long.
PATIENT: Stickers? Like… children? I no like stickers. And you saying I irresponsible? I live 86 years! I know my body! You young doctor, you read books, you no know nothing about life. Just want money. My wife say so.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, with all due respect, longevity doesn't preclude the possibility of medical issues. And I assure you, my concern is for your well-being, not your finances. The stickers are painless, and the test is quick. It's a standard precaution given your symptoms and elevated blood pressure. If you refuse, I can document that, but I strongly advise against it. Now, are you willing to let the nurse attach the EKG leads, or shall we proceed with a referral to a cardiologist without further information?
PATIENT: Cardi… what? Look, fine! Stickers. But make it quick! And no poking! My skin, is very sensitive. And tell nurse to be gentle. Very gentle! I no want to sue nobody. Just do it. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Nurse Lee will take excellent care of you. And please, try to relax, Mr. Sobkowicz. Tensing up will only make things more difficult. Some patients… honestly.
PATIENT: Hmph. Relax? Easy for you to say. You no old. You no have wife yelling about kimchi. Just do the stickers. Hurry up!
DOCTOR: Alright, the EKG is running now. While we wait for the results, let’s go over your medications. What are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… uh. Little blue pill for… you know. Blood pressure pill. White one. And sometimes, when knee hurt, I take something… orange. My wife, she handle all that. I no remember names. She say too many pills, bad for liver. Is she right?
DOCTOR: Alright. A medication for erectile dysfunction, a blood pressure medication, and something for knee pain… Do you know the dosages of any of these?
PATIENT: Dosages? Doctor, you ask too much! I just take them! She give me one of this, two of that. Is enough. I no doctor. I old man. She say stop taking orange pill, make me dizzy. Is she right? Always right, that woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to get a complete medication list from your wife, then. It's crucial to know exactly what you're taking to avoid any interactions. Hmm… Interesting. The EKG shows some signs of left ventricular hypertrophy… and a slight ST-segment depression. It’s not conclusive, but it warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Hyper… what? And ST… thing? Is bad? You say bad? I knew it! Something wrong with my heart! I told you! Old heart, always trouble. I want second opinion! And I want my wife here! She know everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, let’s not jump to conclusions. Left ventricular hypertrophy simply means the muscle of your heart is thickened, which can be caused by high blood pressure. And the ST-segment depression could indicate some reduced blood flow. That's why I want to rule things out. I am recommending a cardiology consult, as I said, but that doesn't automatically mean you're in dire straits. I'm going to order some blood work to check your cardiac enzymes, and we'll schedule a consultation with Dr. Park. Would you like me to call your wife now?
PATIENT: Yes! Call her! Tell her… tell her bring kimchi. She make very good kimchi. And tell her bring list of pills! All the pills! And tell her… tell her I told you something was wrong! Is good, you finally listen. Hurry, Doctor! My stomach, is rumbling.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m calling your wife now. Hello?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good. Finally. This doctor, she take too long. Always asking questions. Kimchi, is answer to everything.
DOCTOR: Your wife is on her way, Mr. Sobkowicz. She said she'll bring the kimchi and the medication list. While we wait, I'm going to write up the referral to Dr. Park and order the blood work. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some samples. In the meantime, please try to relax and conserve your energy. This is going to be a long afternoon.
PATIENT: Hmph. Conserve energy? Old man, I been conserving energy for 86 years! Is what I do! Just get it over with. And tell nurse… gentle. Very gentle! And bring kimchi. That is most important.
DOCTOR: I need a vacation. And a large plate of kimchi. .
