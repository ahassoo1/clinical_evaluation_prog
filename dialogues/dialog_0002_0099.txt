DOCTOR: Hi Denis, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. I received a letter regarding some results from a test… a GI Endo test, it was called. The doctor who ordered it suggested I come speak with you about them. I must admit, I wasn’t entirely clear on what the results meant, precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Those tests can be a bit confusing. Let’s take a look at those results together, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. Just pulling up your information now… Ah, yes, the GI endoscopy from July 15th. Before we dive into the specifics, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For several months, I’ve been experiencing… discomfort. A sort of burning sensation in my stomach, mostly. And a rather persistent feeling of fullness, even after eating very little. It began gradually, but recently it has become… more noticeable. My previous physician thought it best to investigate further, hence the test. I haven’t had any… bleeding, thankfully, or significant weight loss. Just the discomfort, and the feeling of being full rather quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. So, burning sensation and early fullness – that’s helpful. And no bleeding or weight loss, that’s good to know. Is the burning sensation constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… intermittent, Doctor. Not constant, thankfully. It tends to flare up after I eat, especially if I’ve had anything… spicy, or acidic. Citrus fruits also seem to aggravate it. But it does subside, usually within a few hours. It’s not debilitating, but it’s… unsettling, and becoming more frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. So it’s related to food, and certain types of food seem to trigger it. Does anything relieve the burning sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I find that… a glass of milk sometimes helps. Or a small, bland biscuit. Something to coat the stomach, I suppose. And lying down flat for a little while. But it's not a complete solution, just… temporary relief. It always seems to return eventually. I have also found that avoiding those triggering foods helps prevent it, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so milk and bland foods provide some temporary relief, and avoiding trigger foods helps. That's all very useful to know. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the discomfort?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I haven’t experienced any nausea or vomiting. My bowel movements have been… regular, if perhaps a little looser than usual. And I haven’t noticed any changes in my appetite, aside from eating less because of the discomfort, naturally. I have been… rather fatigued lately, but I attributed that to my age, truthfully. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Denis. Fatigue can be a symptom of several things, so it’s good you mentioned it. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any chronic health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not as such, Doctor. I’ve been generally quite healthy, all my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing serious. I did have a bout of pneumonia several years ago, but I recovered fully. And my late husband… he had some heart trouble, but I myself have never been diagnosed with any chronic condition. I do take a daily vitamin, as a precaution. And occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever for arthritis in my hands, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major chronic conditions, just the arthritis and the occasional pain reliever. And a daily vitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I am aware, I have no allergies. I’ve never experienced a reaction to any medication or food. I’ve eaten… a rather eclectic diet throughout my life, traveling as I have, and have never had any issues. My late husband was allergic to shellfish, but I do not share that particular sensitivity. I occasionally have a slight reaction to dust, but it's merely a sniffle, nothing severe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a somewhat difficult question, Doctor. My family is… rather large, and I haven’t been in close contact with many of them for some time. My mother’s side… she had some trouble with her digestion in her later years, but I don’t know the specifics. And my father’s side… his brother had diabetes, I believe. But beyond that, I’m not aware of any significant inherited conditions. I apologize for my lack of precision. Family gatherings were… infrequent, in my youth.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. It's common to not have a complete family medical history. Okay, let’s shift gears a bit. Can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I am widowed, as I mentioned earlier. My husband passed away five years ago. I live alone, in a small cottage just outside of town. I keep quite busy with my metalwork, it’s my passion, and I volunteer at the local historical society a few days a week. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol—perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I enjoy gardening, and reading, and spending time with my grandchildren when they visit. It's a quiet life, but a fulfilling one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds lovely. And very active, despite being quiet. Now, before we look at the endoscopy results, let me just do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. Please proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That doesn't cause any particular discomfort. Perhaps a slight… sensitivity in the upper abdomen, but nothing acute. It feels… rather normal, truthfully. I have always been rather… resilient, I suppose. But proceed as you see fit. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do note a little bit of guarding when I press here, in your upper abdomen. Not significant, but worth noting. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though slightly hypoactive. Okay, now let's look at those endoscopy results. The report shows some mild inflammation in your esophagus and stomach. And… there are some areas of redness, consistent with gastritis. No ulcers were found, which is good. And no signs of malignancy. They did take a biopsy to rule out Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a common cause of gastritis. We’re waiting on those results.
PATIENT: Gastritis… and Helicobacter pylori? Is that… serious, Doctor? And the biopsy… how long will I have to wait for those results? I confess, medical terminology is not my forte. I understand “inflammation,” but the rest… it’s a little overwhelming. And the redness… is that causing the discomfort I’ve been experiencing?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Denis. Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori, is a bacteria that can infect the stomach lining and cause inflammation, leading to gastritis. It’s quite common, and thankfully, it’s usually treatable with antibiotics. The redness you see on the report is indicative of that inflammation. It’s likely the source of your burning sensation and early fullness. As for the biopsy results, they should be back within about a week. It’s just to confirm if H. pylori is present, and if so, what type of treatment would be most effective. It's not immediately serious, but it does need to be addressed to prevent complications down the line. We'll start with some medication to reduce the acid in your stomach. This will help the inflammation heal and give you some relief from your symptoms. Would you be open to trying a proton pump inhibitor?
PATIENT: A proton pump inhibitor… yes, certainly. If it will alleviate the discomfort and address the inflammation, I am quite willing. I trust your judgment implicitly, Doctor. And a week… that seems a reasonable timeframe for the biopsy results. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to have a better understanding of what’s happening. Will the medication have any… side effects? I’ve heard stories, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question to ask. Proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs, are generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, they can have some side effects. The most common ones are mild—things like headache, diarrhea, or constipation. In rare cases, long-term use can increase the risk of certain nutrient deficiencies, but we'll monitor you to make sure that doesn't happen. I'm prescribing you omeprazole, 20mg, once daily, for two weeks. Take it first thing in the morning, about 30 minutes before you eat breakfast. I also recommend avoiding spicy foods, citrus fruits, caffeine, and alcohol for the next couple of weeks, as these can irritate your stomach lining. And try to eat smaller, more frequent meals. We'll see how you're feeling after two weeks, and then we'll discuss the biopsy results and decide on the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Omeprazole, 20mg, once daily, before breakfast. And avoid spicy foods, citrus, caffeine, and alcohol. Smaller meals. Yes, that is perfectly clear. I can certainly manage that. And I will await the results of the biopsy, naturally. Thank you, Doctor. You have been most patient and thorough. I feel… considerably more at ease now, knowing what’s happening and having a plan of action. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any… warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Yes, there are a few warning signs to be aware of. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, black, tarry stools, vomiting blood, or unexplained weight loss, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Those could indicate a more serious problem. Also, if your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two on the medication, let me know. I'm going to write you a referral to a dietitian, just to help you with some meal planning and make sure you're getting the nutrients you need. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: A dietitian… that is thoughtful, Doctor. No, I believe that covers everything. You have been exceptionally thorough and patient with my questions. I truly appreciate your clear explanations and your compassionate care. I shall follow your instructions carefully, and await the results of the biopsy. And I will contact you immediately if any of those warning signs appear. Thank you again, Doctor Ranjan. You have been a great help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you in a week or two. .
