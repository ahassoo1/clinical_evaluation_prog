DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen, and… it's been botherin' me. I also have a heart condition, I was told. It's somethin' about it not beatin' right, atrial… somethin'. It's been diagnosed, but I don't rightly remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nixon. It sounds like you’re experiencing some concerning symptoms. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of both the leg swelling and the heart condition. To start with the leg, could you describe the swelling in more detail?
PATIENT: Right. It started a few days ago, I think. It's mostly in my calf, and… it feels heavy, you know? Like it's full of water or somethin'. And it's a bit painful to walk on it, especially if I've been sittin' for a while. It doesn't hurt constantly, just when I move it about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started a few days ago, primarily in the calf, feels heavy, and is exacerbated by walking and periods of inactivity. Is there any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really red. It feels warm, maybe, but I'm not sure if that's just normal warmth. It doesn’t feel… hot, if that makes sense. Just… normal skin temperature, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, normal skin temperature. And has this happened before, Nixon?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think it has, yes. Not this bad, maybe, but I've noticed my ankles swellin' a bit after a long day. But never this high up on my leg. And it’s never been this uncomfortable before, to be honest. I didn't think much of it last time, just put my feet up and it went away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent swelling in the ankles previously, but this is more significant and higher up on the leg. Do you notice any changes in the skin texture – is it shiny, or does it feel tighter than usual?
PATIENT: Tighter, maybe. Yes, I think so. It doesn't feel… smooth, if you understand. It’s a bit… firm, and not as bouncy as my other leg. I don’t know if that makes sense. I'm not very good at describin' these things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nixon. You're doing a very good job. Firm and not as bouncy as the other leg – that’s helpful information. Now, let’s circle back to your heart condition. You mentioned atrial something?
PATIENT: Yes, atrial… fibrillation, I think the doctor said. It was a few years ago now. I have to take a pill every day for it. They said it makes my heart beat… irregularly, and that could cause problems. I don’t really know what problems, and I didn't really ask many questions, I just took the pill. Is this leg swelling somethin' to do with my heart?
DOCTOR: It’s quite possible there’s a connection, Nixon. Atrial fibrillation can sometimes lead to fluid retention, which could explain the swelling in your leg. However, there are other possible causes we need to rule out. To get a better understanding, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Please do. I’d like to know what's goin' on. I've been worryin' about this leg for days now. Feel free to poke and prod as much as you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll palpate your leg to assess the swelling and check for tenderness. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Your pulse is indeed irregular, consistent with atrial fibrillation. I hear some normal heart sounds, no murmurs. Now, let me examine your leg. The swelling is most prominent in the lower calf. It’s firm to the touch, and there is some tenderness when I press here. The pulses in your foot are present, but slightly weaker than on your other leg. I'll also measure the circumference of both calves to document the difference in size. There's a 3-centimeter difference in circumference between your legs, which confirms the swelling. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and the findings on exam, my initial concern is for possible heart failure exacerbation leading to edema, or a blood clot in the leg. However, we need further testing to determine the exact cause.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot? That sounds… serious. Heart failure? I didn't even know I had heart failure. What sort of tests do you need to do? And how long will that take? Is this somethin' I should be really worried about? I feel a bit faint now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Nixon. A blood clot, or deep vein thrombosis , can be serious, and heart failure requires careful management. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions before we have the test results. We'll start with a blood test called a D-dimer. This can help rule out a blood clot. If the D-dimer is elevated, we’ll need an ultrasound of your leg to confirm or exclude a DVT. We’ll also order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and look for any signs of strain. And I'd like to order a BNP level, which is a blood test that can help assess for heart failure. These tests should take about an hour or two to complete. And, as a precaution, given your concerns and the possibility of heart failure, I'm going to order a chest X-ray to assess your lungs for fluid buildup. You’re feeling faint, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, just a bit lightheaded. It’s probably just worryin’ about all this. An hour or two... That doesn’t sound too bad. And the chest X-ray is for my lungs? That's good, I suppose. What happens if the D-dimer is high? What do you do for a blood clot? I’ve seen things on the television… it sounded dreadful.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Nixon, especially with all this new information. We’ll take things one step at a time. If the D-dimer is elevated, it doesn't definitely mean you have a blood clot, but it does mean we need to investigate further with an ultrasound. If the ultrasound confirms a DVT, treatment typically involves blood thinners – medications to prevent the clot from growing and reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs, which is a serious complication. Fortunately, with prompt treatment, most DVTs can be managed effectively. Before we proceed with the tests, I want to check your oxygen saturation just to be sure everything is alright. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is good. Still, because you’re feeling lightheaded, I’m going to have a nurse bring you a glass of water and have you sit quietly for a few minutes while we wait for the test results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Water sounds lovely. And quiet… that would be very welcome. I do appreciate you takin' your time and explainin' everything so clearly, Doctor. It's… reassuring, even though it's a bit frighten'in'. A glass of water and a bit of quiet… that's perfect for now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. It's my job to make sure you understand what’s happening and feel comfortable. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. We’ll get these tests done and figure out what’s going on. In the meantime, try to take a few deep breaths and relax. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not that I know of, no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to take penicillin as a child, I think, but that was a long time ago. I'm not on any other medications except for the pill for my heart, the one for the atrial… fibrillation. It’s a small white one. I hope that’s helpful. I’m tryin’ to breathe deeply, it’s just a bit difficult with all this worryin’.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nixon. No known allergies and just the medication for atrial fibrillation. That helps us rule out potential complications. Nurse, could you please offer Nixon some water and ensure she’s comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Nurse. That's very kind of you. It's a bit dry in here. I think… I think I'm starting to feel a little bit calmer now. Still anxious, but not quite as faint. I’m grateful for the water and the quiet. Thank you both. When do you think the test results will be back?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Nixon. A little calmer is a good start. The lab typically takes about 45 minutes to an hour for the D-dimer and BNP levels, and the EKG results should be available almost immediately. The ultrasound technician is also on call, and we can usually get an appointment within the next hour or two if needed. Let me just check the computer again... It seems the EKG results are back. It confirms atrial fibrillation, as expected, but shows no signs of an acute heart attack. That’s reassuring. We’ll proceed with the blood tests and, depending on those results, we’ll discuss the next steps, including the possibility of an ultrasound. Do you have any questions about the EKG results?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… atrial fibrillation, like you said. That’s what I already knew. No heart attack is good, very good. I suppose… I suppose I'll just sit here and wait for the blood test results then. And try not to worry too much. It's easier said than done, though, isn't it? Thank you both for your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. It's perfectly understandable to be anxious, and we'll take things at your pace. We’ll be right here when the results come in. Feel free to let us know if you need anything at all.
