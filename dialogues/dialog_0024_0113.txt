DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You're seventy-four years old, a Ukrainian male…yes, I see that. Please, tell me in concise terms why you are here today. I have other patients waiting, you understand.
PATIENT: Well, now, that’s a bit abrupt, isn’t it? But alright. I’ve been…going to the bathroom a lot. More than usual, you see. It’s a bother, really. Wakes me up at night, too. It’s just…frequent. That's what my wife keeps saying, anyway. She’s the one who made the appointment. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: "Frequent," you say. A remarkably unhelpful descriptor, frankly. How many times "frequent" is that, precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, don't look at me like that. How am I supposed to count? I’m not one of those…organized types. It feels like every couple of hours during the day, and then…two, maybe three times a night. Could be more, could be less. I don’t keep a log, if that’s what you’re expecting. It’s just…a lot. More than it used to be. And it’s not like I’m drinking gallons of tea or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. So, an imprecise estimate of approximately two to three nocturnal voids, with daytime frequency…unquantified. And you insist you haven’t altered your fluid intake?
PATIENT: Altered? Now you're using fancy words again. No, I haven’t. I drink my coffee in the morning, a little water with lunch, maybe a glass of juice with dinner. Same as always. My wife makes sure I stay hydrated, you know. She's always fussing over that. But honestly, I don’t go excessively thirsty, if that helps. It's just...annoying. A man needs his sleep, you know? And I'm getting up, then cold...it's a nuisance.
DOCTOR: “Annoying.” Very well. Let’s move on to more pertinent details. Do you experience any pain or burning during urination?
PATIENT: Pain? Burning? No, not really. It doesn’t…hurt, exactly. It’s just…the urge. Comes on suddenly, you see. And then…well, you know. Just a normal stream, I suppose. Nothing…different about the stream itself. Just the frequency of it all. Honestly, I think my wife worries too much. She's always been a bit of a hypochondriac, that one. But she insisted I come.
DOCTOR: “Normal stream,” you say. And you’ve noticed no changes in color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Odor? Goodness, no, I haven’t been inspecting my…well, you know. I use the bathroom, and that’s that. It looks like…urine, I suppose. Yellowish, like it always is. I don’t go sniffing at it or anything! Really, doctor, this is getting a bit personal. I just want to sleep through the night! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any difficulty starting the stream?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Well, now… sometimes it takes a moment. Not a long moment, mind you. Just a little…hesitation. Like a little cough before it gets going. It’s not a struggle, not like that. Just…a bit slow to start. Happens more at night, I think. But nothing I haven’t dealt with before. It's just…getting old, I suppose. Everything starts to slow down eventually. It’s a fact of life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, lie down on the table. I suppose a brief physical examination is unavoidable, despite the lack of detail in your…history. We need to rule out the obvious.
PATIENT: Oh, now, really? Lie down? I didn’t come here for a…a poking and prodding! Is that necessary, doctor? I just told you what’s been bothering me. All this fuss… Honestly, I'm starting to think my wife sent me on a wild goose chase. It’s just a bit of frequent urination, not the end of the world. But… alright, alright. If you insist. But don't expect much. I'm not a young man anymore, and I'm not exactly flexible.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Prostate…is enlarged, as expected for your age. Not acutely inflamed, but definitely prominent. Now, let’s discuss potential causes. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, the most likely explanation is benign prostatic hyperplasia – an enlarged prostate. It’s quite common in men your age. It compresses the urethra, causing the frequent urination and hesitancy you've described. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a PSA test. The PSA will help determine if there is any sign of prostate cancer.
PATIENT: Benign… what did you say? Hyper-something? And what’s a…PSA? More tests? Honestly, doctor, this is getting ridiculous. All this poking and prodding and now more tests. Can’t you just give me something to…to stop the frequent urination? A pill or something? My wife is going to be furious if I have to come back here again. And this prostate… is it serious? Is it…cancer? Now you’re scaring me. I just wanted a good night's sleep!
DOCTOR: Please, try to remain calm. “Benign prostatic hyperplasia” simply means an enlarged prostate, which is not cancerous. It’s a very common condition, as I said. The PSA test – prostate-specific antigen – is a blood test that measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated level can indicate prostate cancer, but it can also be caused by other things, such as inflammation or infection. We need to perform the test to get a clearer picture. As for a “pill,” there are medications available to help manage the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, they have potential side effects, and we need to have a full understanding of your condition before prescribing anything. I will review the test results and discuss the best course of action with you. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your fluid intake before bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Limiting fluids… that’s just… lovely. And no caffeine? My wife makes me coffee every morning! This is going to be a disaster. And what about these side effects? What kind of side effects? I don’t want to be…incapable or something! Honestly, doctor, you’re making me more anxious than I was before. I just want this all to be over. I suppose… I suppose I should ask about that. What kind of side effects are we talking about? And how long will it take to get these… test results? Is it going to be weeks? I just want to sleep through the night, is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The potential side effects of the medications vary depending on the specific drug, but can include dizziness, lightheadedness, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. These are not common, and often manageable, but it's important to be aware of them. The laboratory results should be available within three to five business days. Here is the requisition form for the urinalysis and PSA test. Please take this to the lab, and they will draw the blood sample and collect a urine sample. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Segretto. We are taking all necessary precautions to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you require a work/school note?
PATIENT: A work note? Goodness, no. I’m retired. I haven't worked in twenty years. Honestly, doctor, you’re treating me like a child. Just… tell me if everything is alright. That’s all I want to know. Is my prostate…dangerous? Is it something to be truly worried about? And… will these pills make me…well, you know. I don't want to be a burden to my wife. I just want a straight answer, doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I assure you, we are not dismissing your concerns. The vast majority of men with an enlarged prostate do not have cancer. The PSA test is simply a screening tool to identify those who may require further investigation. It's a precaution, nothing more. As for the medications, the risk of significant sexual side effects is relatively low. However, it’s a possibility that we will discuss in detail before prescribing anything. We will also explore other treatment options, such as lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, minimally invasive procedures. For now, please focus on obtaining the lab tests and try to remain calm. We will address your concerns thoroughly at your follow-up appointment. I have other patients waiting, and I am sure they have similar concerns. If you experience any sudden pain, difficulty urinating, or blood in your urine, please seek immediate medical attention. Good day, Mr. Segretto. .
