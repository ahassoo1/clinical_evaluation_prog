DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my back. It's been really bad. Hurts a lot. It's not new, though. I... I have the cancer, you know? And it’s been hurting more and more lately. It’s in my back now, I think. It just... aches all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing increased back pain, and you’re concerned it might be related to your cancer. Thank you for letting me know. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me more about this back pain?
PATIENT: Okay. Um... it’s... hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, not always. Sometimes it is, if I move wrong. But mostly it just... is there. Like a heavy weight. And it goes all the way around, not just in my back, but... my sides too. It’s worse when I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I try to lift something. Even just bending over to put on my shoes is bad. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant ache that radiates around your back and sides, worsened by standing, lifting, and bending. That’s very helpful. Now, when did you first notice this pain becoming more prominent?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? It was just a little bit then, I could still do things. But it’s been getting worse every week, I think. Last week was really bad, that’s why I came in. I couldn’t sleep. Even sitting was hard. I tried taking some of the pills the other doctor gave me, but they don’t seem to work as well anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain has been progressively worsening over the past month, and your current pain medication isn’t providing sufficient relief. And you said "the other doctor?
PATIENT: Yes, sorry. Doctor Lim. He’s the one who… found the cancer. He gave me the pills. He's good, but... I haven't seen him in a few months. Just been going to the appointments they set up for me. And the pain just... kept getting worse. It’s been hard to get ahold of him too. That's why I made an appointment with you. I needed to see someone about it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Meigs. It’s important to have your concerns addressed, and I’m glad you came in. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little bit about the cancer itself?
PATIENT: Okay… um… it's in my lung. Doctor Lim said it was… stage three? I don’t really… understand all the stages. He said it had spread a little, but they were trying to keep it under control with… medicine. That’s why I take the pills. And I’ve been going to… radiation sometimes. But it makes me tired, so we don’t do it all the time. He said it was… adenocarcinoma? Is that right? I remember him saying that. It’s a long word. Mostly I just know it’s in my lung and it hurts. And now it hurts in my back. I’m worried it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. That's helpful. So, you've been diagnosed with stage three adenocarcinoma of the lung, and you're currently undergoing treatment with medication and intermittent radiation therapy. You're understandably concerned about the increased back pain, and the possibility of disease progression. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit more broadly. Have you had any other significant medical conditions in the past, besides the lung cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really. I had the flu a few times, but nothing serious. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up okay. I have… high blood pressure, Doctor Lim said, so I take a pill for that too. And… my sugar was a little high at one point, but it's okay now. Just the cancer and the blood pressure, mostly. Oh, and sometimes my knees bother me, but that's just from getting old, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Meigs. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, and previously elevated blood sugar which is now controlled. You also mention occasional knee discomfort. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had any surgeries. Not even my tonsils. Doctor Lim did a… a biopsy, when he found the cancer. That’s not really surgery, is it? Just a little poke. And he put a… a line in my chest, for the medicine. But that wasn’t surgery either.
DOCTOR: No, those wouldn’t be considered major surgeries. Just the biopsy and the chest line. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's hard to say. My mom… she had heart trouble when she was old. And my dad… he had diabetes. But that was when he was old too. And… my brother, he had high blood pressure. So, heart trouble, diabetes, high blood pressure… that's about it. I don't really know much about my grandparents. They lived… far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and high blood pressure. That’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... um... I try to eat healthy. Mostly fish and rice, and some vegetables. I don't drink a lot of soda, just water. And I used to walk a lot, before my back started hurting. Now I… don't do much. I mostly stay home and watch TV. It's hard to get around. I used to be very active though. I liked to garden, and go to church sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you generally maintain a healthy diet, but your activity level has decreased due to your back pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. Doctor Lim asked me that when he first started treating me, and I told him no. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to any of the pills he gave me. Not yet, anyway. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I take the radiation pills, but it doesn’t last long. Just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, with some mild skin irritation from the radiation medication. That's good to know. Now, Ms. Meigs, can you tell me which medications you are currently taking, including the dosages if you know them?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… I have the… the cancer pills. They’re white and small. Doctor Lim said to take two of them every day. And then I have a pill for my blood pressure. It’s pink and… a little bigger. I take one of those every morning too. And… sometimes, after the radiation, I take something for the nausea. That one's blue. I only take it when I feel sick, though. I don’t know the numbers, the… the dosages. I just take what Doctor Lim tells me to. Here, maybe these will help. I brought them with me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs, that’s very helpful. Okay, so you’re taking [reads from bottle] Gefitinib 250mg twice daily, Amlodipine 5mg once daily, and Prochlorperazine 5mg as needed for nausea. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my back. It hurts so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll palpate your back and abdomen to assess the source of your pain. I’ll also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished at the bases, which is not uncommon with decreased activity. Now, can you point to the exact location where you’re experiencing the most pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Right there… and a little bit around here too. It hurts all over, but it’s the worst right there. And it feels… like it goes deep. It’s not just on the surface. It’s… hard to explain. It’s like a heavy ache, that’s always there. And it gets worse when you press on it.
DOCTOR: I understand. There is tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, bilaterally. I also note some muscle spasm in that region. Your reflexes are intact, and your muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Based on the exam, it appears you have some significant tenderness and muscle spasm in your lower back. It’s difficult to determine the exact cause of your pain without further investigation, but given your history of lung cancer, it’s important to rule out possible metastasis to the bone.
PATIENT: Met… what? What does that mean? Is it bad? Is the cancer… in my back now?
DOCTOR: Metastasis means the cancer has spread from where it originally started – in your lungs – to another part of your body. Given your increasing back pain, it's possible the cancer has spread to your bones. However, it’s also important to remember that back pain can have many causes, and it doesn’t automatically mean the cancer has spread. To determine the exact cause of your pain, I’d like to order some imaging tests, specifically an X-ray of your spine and a bone scan. A bone scan can help us detect any areas of increased activity that could indicate the presence of cancer cells. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… a scan. I guess so. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t want it to get worse. I’m scared. How long will it take to get the results? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be scared, Ms. Meigs. We’re going to do everything we can to figure this out and provide you with the best possible care. The X-ray doesn't involve any radiation beyond a standard chest x-ray. The bone scan does involve an injection of a small amount of radioactive material, but it's a very safe procedure, and the amount of radiation exposure is minimal. It may cause some slight discomfort at the injection site, but it’s generally well-tolerated. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a stronger pain medication to help manage your discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… stronger pills would be good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It helps to know what’s going on, even if it’s scary. What kind of pain pills are they? Will they make me… sleepy? I have to be able to… well, I don’t do much, but I still need to… be myself, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I understand. I'm prescribing you Tramadol, a non-narcotic pain reliever. It can cause some drowsiness in some patients, but it’s less likely to cause sedation compared to stronger opioids. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. It’s important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking Tramadol, but for your level of activity, it shouldn't interfere with your daily life too much. I’m also going to order a physical therapy consult. Gentle exercises and stretching can help strengthen your back muscles and alleviate some of your pain. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. I told the other doctor that already. Just the cancer pills, the blood pressure pills, and now these… tramadol pills. That’s it. And the radiation pills, sometimes. But only when I get the radiation. I just get a little itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies. Before we finish, I want to reiterate the importance of contacting me immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder changes. Here's a printout with instructions on how to take the Tramadol, information on your physical therapy consult, and contact information for the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to help. I really appreciate it. I'm just scared about the scan. But... I'm glad we're doing something. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It’s perfectly normal to be scared, and I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll get through this together. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to take things one day at a time. Have a good day, Ms. Meigs, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
