DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… a long time now, I think. Honestly, I can't really put a finger on when it started, exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: A long time, you say. And when you say tired, can you describe that a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… not just needing a nap, you know? It’s like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting out of bed. And it doesn’t really get better with rest, not really. It’s… heavy. Like I’m carrying something all the time. Does that make sense? I just… feel drained.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. “Drained” is a good way to put it. And this feeling… does it interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. I used to… well, I worked at the pharmacy, still do actually, part-time. But even that… it's hard to concentrate. I have to check everything twice, sometimes three times. And… I don’t really do much else anymore. Used to like gardening, but… too much effort. My husband… he liked the garden, too.
DOCTOR: I see. So, fatigue impacting work and hobbies. And you mentioned checking things multiple times… is that new, this difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Oh… I suppose it is newer. It wasn't… like this before. I used to be very good with details, at the pharmacy. People always said so. Now… I’m constantly worried I'll make a mistake. It’s… unsettling. Everything feels… foggy, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Foggy, you say. Alright. And are there any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue and…fogginess?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I ache, sometimes. Not like a sharp pain, just… a dull ache all over. And… I’ve been feeling a little… down, I guess. Not sad, exactly… just… not myself. I don’t really have much energy for anything, so I just… exist.
DOCTOR: Aches and a general feeling of… being unwell. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. I think… I’m not eating as much. Just… don’t feel hungry. And… I haven’t really been weighing myself, to be honest. Everything feels a bit… pointless, lately. I probably have lost a bit, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before we continue, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… just the usual for my age, I suppose. Something for my blood pressure, a little something for my cholesterol. And… I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me I was a bit low on that a while back. Let me think… I can’t really remember the names, to be honest. My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can sort that out. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky like that, I think. Though… I haven't really tried anything new, in ages. It all feels like too much effort, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… I had pneumonia, once, a long time back. Nothing major, I don't think. Just the usual, you know. I broke my wrist when I was a child, but that was a long, long time ago. Honestly, everything is starting to blur together.
DOCTOR: Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. It was a long time ago. I’m not sure… I don’t really remember much about it. They didn't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very rarely. And… absolutely not the other thing. I am a simple woman, doctor. Simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Get it over with, please. I have… things to do. Not that I can do them, but… I have them.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Pulses are regular and present. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit sluggish. And finally, a quick assessment of your cranial nerves. No focal neurological deficits noted, but some mild difficulty with recall. Okay. Based on the history and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing significant fatigue, likely accompanied by some mild cognitive impairment and a degree of depression. However, there are several potential causes for these symptoms. To further investigate, I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. We should also check your iron levels, and potentially a sedimentation rate to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. Would that be alright?
