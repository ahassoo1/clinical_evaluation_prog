DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. VODZAK. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Lovely to meet you? I’ve been coming to doctors for eighty years, young lady. Don’t need introductions. It’s this foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it’s not getting any better. It's a sore, and it won’t heal. A proper nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to come in, Louine. Eighty years of experience with doctors – that’s wisdom! And I apologize for the unnecessary introduction. It’s good to know you’re a seasoned patient. This foot soreness…can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Seasoned is putting it mildly. Back in my day, doctors made house calls, and you respected them. These days…well, never mind. Anyway. The sore…it's on the bottom of my foot, right here. It started as just a little red spot, I thought it was a blister maybe. But it just…got worse. Now it's deep, and it hurts when I walk. And it smells…bad. Honestly, it's quite embarrassing. I’ve tried putting ointment on it, all sorts of things, but nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: I see. It does look quite irritated. And you’re right, there is a bit of an odor. It’s good you’ve tried ointments, but sometimes those don’t reach deep enough. When did you first notice this red spot, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was…after I went to visit my niece in Majuro. That was…July the 10th, I believe. Yes, July 10th. We were walking on the beach a lot, and I think that’s when it started bothering me. Just a little ache at first. I didn’t think much of it. Now look at it! A proper mess. And I have to wear shoes all the time, you know. Makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 10th, after your trip to Majuro. Walking on the beach…that’s helpful information. Does the pain feel like a sharp ache, or more of a dull throbbing?
PATIENT: Throbbing, definitely throbbing. Especially at the end of the day. And if I try to walk too much. It's not a sharp pain, not usually. More like…a heavy ache. It keeps me up at night sometimes, honestly. And it's so hot here! Makes everything swell up, you know. Makes the throbbing worse. I used to be able to walk for miles, but now… It’s just not the same.
DOCTOR: That sounds very uncomfortable, Louine. The throbbing, especially with the heat and swelling, makes perfect sense. It's good you're telling me all of this. Now, have you noticed any drainage coming from the sore at all?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmph. What do you mean, "drainage"? You mean…pus? Yes. A little bit. It’s…yellowish. And it smells…well, you already know about the smell. It gets on my socks. It’s quite unpleasant. I clean it every day, of course, but it just keeps coming back. A proper nuisance, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish drainage…that’s important information. And you’re right to keep it clean. It sounds like you may have a developing infection in the sore. I want to take a closer look and then we'll need to do a quick test to confirm what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Infection? Goodness gracious. What kind of infection? I haven’t been sick in years! I don’t like the sound of that at all. What kind of test? Is it going to hurt? And are you sure you know what you’re doing, young lady? I’ve seen some questionable doctors in my time…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Louine. It’s good to be cautious. It’s not necessarily a serious infection, but it's important to identify it so we can treat it properly. The test is very simple – I'll take a small swab of the drainage from the sore. It won’t hurt more than a quick pinch, like a little scrape. It will help us determine what type of bacteria is causing the issue. I've been practicing medicine for fourteen years and I'm confident we can get this sorted out. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Fourteen years... hmm. Still rather young, if you ask me. But better than some I've encountered. A swab, you say? Just a little scrape? Alright. But be gentle! And tell me what you're doing, step by step. I don't like surprises. And if it does hurt, I want you to know right away. Don't try to be brave for my sake.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Louine. I will explain everything as I go, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. It’s important to me that you’re comfortable. First, I’m going to gently clean the area around the sore with this solution. It might feel a little cool. Now, I’m just going to touch this swab to the sore to collect a small sample. That's all done. It really was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Hmph. It wasn’t pleasant, I'll tell you that. A little cold, yes, just as you said. And it did tickle. But I suppose it wasn’t as bad as I feared. Now what? Do you need to send it off to a laboratory? Will it take long to get the results? I have a luncheon next Tuesday, and I’d hate to miss it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I will send this sample to the lab for analysis. It usually takes about 48 to 72 hours to get the results, so we should have them by Friday. That gives us plenty of time before your luncheon next Tuesday. While we wait for the results, I recommend keeping the area clean and dry, and avoiding walking too much. We can also use a special bandage to protect the sore and help it heal. Do you have any allergies to bandages or adhesives?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve used bandages my whole life. Though I must say, the ones they make these days aren’t as good as they used to be. They don’t stick properly. But I suppose they’ll do. And you're sure this little scrape is all you need? It just doesn’t seem like enough to figure out what’s wrong. In my day, doctors actually examined patients. Listened to their hearts, took their temperatures…
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Louine. A thorough examination is vital. I did listen to your heart and lungs earlier, and your vital signs are stable. The swab is the most effective way to determine the specific type of bacteria causing the infection, which allows me to prescribe the most appropriate antibiotic. However, given your concern, and to be absolutely certain, I'd also like to take a quick look at your blood sugar levels, just to rule out anything else that could be contributing to the slow healing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood sugar? What on earth for? Are you suggesting I have… that? I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Mostly fish and vegetables. And a little bit of coconut cream. No, I don’t need a blood sugar test. It’s a waste of time. And frankly, it’s insulting.
DOCTOR: Please don’t be insulted, Louine. It’s simply a routine precaution, especially given the slow healing of the sore. High blood sugar can sometimes affect wound healing, and it's important to rule it out. It's a very quick and simple test – just a small prick of the finger, like with the swab. It doesn’t mean I think you have anything wrong, it’s just good medical practice to be thorough. It will give us a more complete picture and help me ensure I’m providing you with the best possible care. Would you reconsider?
PATIENT: Hmph. Thorough, you say? Well... I suppose it couldn’t hurt. But if it does hurt, I’m holding you personally responsible. And don't expect me to be polite about it. Get it over with quickly, then. And be gentle! I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Louine. I will be as gentle as possible. This will only take a moment. Okay, that’s all done. Just a tiny bit of pressure for a moment. We'll get the results in a few minutes. While we wait, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health… Do you have any difficulty with walking or balance, other than this sore?
PATIENT: Walking? Well, it’s not as easy as it used to be, naturally. Eighty-nine years takes its toll. But I manage. I walk to the market most days, and I still do a little gardening. Though I have to be careful not to fall. My niece, she worries about me. Says I should get a walking stick. But I refuse. It makes me feel old. Balance…sometimes a little shaky, especially in the heat. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: It’s wonderful that you’re still so active, Louine. Staying independent is so important. And it’s perfectly normal to experience some balance issues as we get older, especially with the heat. We can discuss some exercises to help improve your balance if you’d like. Okay, your blood sugar level is 115. That’s within the normal range. So, that rules out that possibility. Everything is pointing towards a localized infection in the sore. Let's get you set up with an antibiotic and a special bandage to help it heal.
PATIENT: Localized infection, you say? Well, that’s something, at least. Not my blood sugar, thank goodness. What kind of antibiotic? Will it make me sleepy? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I can’t be falling asleep at the table. And what about this bandage? Will it be comfortable? I don’t want anything that rubs or irritates my skin. I have very sensitive skin, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Louine. I’m glad you’re asking. I’m going to prescribe a course of oral cephalexin, 500mg twice a day for ten days. It’s a common antibiotic with minimal side effects. It shouldn’t make you sleepy, but if you do experience any drowsiness, please let me know right away. As for the bandage, I’m going to use a hydrocolloid bandage. It’s designed to create a moist healing environment and protect the sore from further irritation. It’s also very flexible and should be quite comfortable. I’ll show you how to apply it and change it properly. We’ll also talk about keeping the area clean and dry. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Cephalexin… hydrocolloid… Honestly, the names they give these things these days! But alright. As long as it doesn’t make me sleepy, and it’s comfortable. Show me how to use it, then. I might need my niece to help me with the changes, though. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. And be very clear about how often I need to do it. I don’t want to get it wrong.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. It’s very simple. First, make sure the area around the sore is clean and dry. Then, peel back the backing of the bandage and gently apply it to the sore, making sure it covers the entire wound. Press down firmly for a few seconds to secure it in place. You’ll want to change it every 24 hours, or sooner if it becomes saturated with drainage. Here’s a sheet with all of this information written down, just in case. And don’t hesitate to ask your niece for help if you need it. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. A little small print, if you ask me. But alright. I think that covers it. No, I don’t suppose I have any other questions. Just…try not to prescribe anything too complicated next time, dear. I’m an old woman, after all. And thank you for not suggesting I had something wrong with my blood sugar. That was very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. I'm happy to help. And I promise to keep things simple in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check on your progress. Have a lovely day, and enjoy your bridge game!
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. I will. And I expect good results. Goodbye, dear. And try not to let young patients intimidate you. Some of us have been around for a long time. .
