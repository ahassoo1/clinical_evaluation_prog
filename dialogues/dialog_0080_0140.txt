DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. I don't usually bother doctors with… these sorts of things. It’s a white coating in my mouth. It’s… unpleasant. I assume it’s nothing serious, I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you came in, even if it feels embarrassing. We deal with all sorts of things here, no judgment at all. A white coating in the mouth… how long have you noticed it, and where exactly is it located?
PATIENT: Oh, a few days, perhaps? I haven't been paying close attention, truthfully. It’s… all over, really. Tongue, cheeks, the roof of my mouth. It's just… there. Is it contagious? My wife would be furious if I gave her something.
DOCTOR: Okay, “all over” gives me a little more to work with. A few days’ duration is also helpful. And I completely understand your concern about your wife. Let's address the contagiousness question first: it could be, depending on the cause, but we’ll figure that out. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or difficulty with tasting?
PATIENT: Pain? No. I haven’t got time for pain. Difficulty tasting… not particularly. Everything tastes… bland, perhaps. But that could be the cooking, frankly. My wife isn't a chef, you understand. It's just… an inconvenience, really. I need to be able to properly assess business deals, and that requires a functioning palate.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your… directness, Antoine. Bland taste is good to know. So, no pain, no burning, just the white coating and altered taste. Have you had a fever, any recent illnesses, or noticed any other symptoms at all – like dry mouth, cracks at the corners of your mouth, or any redness?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Perfectly healthy, as usual. A bit stressed, naturally, running a business. But that's just life. No redness, no cracks, nothing of the sort. Honestly, doctor, I haven't been examining my mouth with a magnifying glass. I have more important things to do. Is this going to take long? I have a conference call in… well, I had a conference call. I've had to reschedule.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your time is valuable, Antoine. I just want to rule out anything serious. Let me take a quick look, if that’s alright. It will only take a minute. Could you open wide for me and stick your tongue out as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. There. Happy? Is it that bad? It's probably just stress. People get mouth ulcers when they're stressed, don't they?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see a fairly uniform white coating on your tongue, buccal mucosa, and palate. It doesn't appear ulcerated, which is good. It's quite extensive, though. Your saliva looks normal. There's no obvious swelling or redness. Based on what I’m seeing, it could be a few things – most likely oral thrush, or possibly a mild case of geographic tongue, although geographic tongue usually presents with more patchy redness. It’s also possible it’s a simple coating due to dehydration or irritation. To be sure, I'd like to do a quick swab to rule out a fungal infection. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? Is that necessary? It sounds… unpleasant. And honestly, doctor, I assure you, my hygiene is impeccable. I brush twice a day. Perhaps it is just stress. Can't we just… prescribe something? Something for the stress? A mild sedative, perhaps? I have important negotiations coming up. A swab seems… excessive. And what if it’s contagious? My wife… .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine. The swab is quick and painless, I promise – just a little cotton swab to collect a sample. It’s the best way to quickly determine if it’s a fungal infection, and then we’ll know exactly what we’re dealing with. As for contagiousness, if it is thrush, it's generally mild and easily treated. And we wouldn't prescribe anything without knowing the cause first. A sedative wouldn't address the underlying issue, and could actually mask other potential problems. Look, let's just do the swab, okay?
