DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is fine. Well, it’s about… these little spells I’ve been having. Confusing spells, you could say. My wife, she’s the one who really insisted I come. Says I ask the same questions twice, forget where I put things… things a man should remember.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It’s good that your wife is looking out for you, and it’s certainly wise to get these things checked out. It sounds like you're experiencing some memory difficulties. When did you first start noticing these "spells," as you call them?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like it was sudden, you know? Gradual. Maybe… six months ago? Started with just little things. Misplacing the remote, forgetting what I went to the store for. Now… well, now it’s more than that. I questioned my grandson’s name just yesterday. Yesterday! He’s ten years old, Doctor. Ten.
DOCTOR: That does sound concerning, Mr. Lason. Forgetting a grandson’s name after ten years is definitely something we should investigate further. Can you describe what these episodes are like when you forget things?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like a blank spot. Like someone erased a little piece of my brain. I know I should know. I feel like I know. But the word… the memory… it’s just… gone. It's frustrating. Makes me feel… less than. I built houses, Doctor. Stone work, tile… complicated things! Now I can’t remember if I took my pills this morning. It’s… humiliating.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand how frustrating and concerning that must be, Mr. Lason. It’s good you’re recognizing these changes and that you've come in to discuss them. We’ll work through this together. Besides the memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm. My wife says I’m more… irritable, maybe? Snappier than usual. I don’t see it, but she’s always been good at noticing things. And… sometimes I feel… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… not quite right. Like my thinking is slow. And I've been sleeping… a lot. More than I used to. Do you need me to list everything? Because I could go on all day. My wife keeps a list, you know.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a good start, Mr. Lason. It's helpful to have this information. The irritability, changes in sleep patterns, and feeling "off" are all things we should consider. Do you have any difficulty with tasks you've always found easy, like paying bills or following a recipe?
PATIENT: Oh, recipes? Forget about it. My wife does all the cooking now. Used to make a mean Khmer curry, you know. But… bills, yes. I used to handle all the finances. Now I get confused easily with the numbers. It takes me forever, and my wife has to double-check everything. And… I lost track of a payment once. Small thing, but still. It bothers me. A man should be able to manage his own affairs.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason. These details are very helpful. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor gave me pills for it… years ago. Still take them. And…arthritis in my knees. Makes getting around a bit tough. Otherwise… no. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Lived a hard life, built things with my hands. Never had much time for being sick. Though, my wife says I have a touch of the… what she calls ‘forgetfulness’. She’s very observant, that woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… There was a time, back in the 80s, when I fell off the scaffolding. Broke my arm, had surgery to set it. And… appendicitis when I was a young man. Aside from that, no. Mostly just bumps and bruises from the job. Nothing serious enough to be hospitalized for, except the arm. That was a bad break, you know. Needed pins and everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications other than the pills for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the high blood pressure pills. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they're really bothering me. Over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you know what I mean. My body can only handle so much, after all these years.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Khmer food can be spicy, you know. You need a strong stomach. My wife always makes sure I don’t take anything too hot, though. She worries. A good woman, that wife of mine.
DOCTOR: That's good. Lastly, before we do a brief physical exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he lived a long life. But towards the end… he got confused too. My wife says it runs in the family. Something about the brain… getting old. She reads a lot, you know. Says it's called… dementia. But I don’t like to think about that. Too depressing. My mother, she passed away young. Never knew her very well. Didn't have much family, really. Just me and my younger sister, but we don't speak anymore. Now, what did you want to examine?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Lason. It’s good to be aware of family history, but we don’t want to jump to conclusions. We'll take things one step at a time. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam—just to assess your reflexes, balance, and memory. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But don't poke too much. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know. And… if I start forgetting things during the exam, don't be alarmed. My wife says it comes and goes. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll take our time. First, let’s just check your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your arm relaxed?
PATIENT: Fine. Just be quick about it, alright? My knees are starting to ache already. And make sure that cuff isn’t too tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm for me, Mr. Lason. Taking a deep breath can help. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs. Lungs are clear, with good air movement on both sides. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fire away. But don't expect me to remember everything, you hear? My wife tells me I repeat myself sometimes. And… if I get confused, just tell me. Don’t want to be embarrassed in front of the doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. There’s no need to be embarrassed. This is a safe place, and we’re just gathering information. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Let me think… Is it… the 2nd? August the 2nd? Yes, I think so. August the 2nd, 2025. My wife, she always keeps track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Very good. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we…? Doctor Alanes’ clinic, of course. In the… rural part of town. My wife said it was a bit of a drive. Small clinic, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That's right. You're doing very well. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is that what you wanted? It’s not a very difficult test, is it? My brain still works, you know.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a simple math problem. What is 10 minus 7?
PATIENT: Ten minus seven…? Let me see… Seven… eight… nine… three! No, wait… Three! Yes, three. Ten minus seven is three. Is that right? I used to be good at numbers. Built houses, you know. Lots of calculating.
DOCTOR: That's correct. Now, can you tell me the names of three things that are red?
PATIENT: Three things that are red… Let me think… Red… Apples, of course! And… roses! Yes, red roses. And… …fire trucks! Fire trucks are red. Do those count?
DOCTOR: Those count perfectly, Mr. Lason. You’re doing very well. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock showing 10 minutes past 11. I have a piece of paper and a pen here for you. It doesn’t need to be perfect, just your best effort.
PATIENT: Draw a clock…? I haven’t drawn anything in years. Built things with my hands, you know, not pictures. But… alright. It’s not going to be pretty, Doctor. Don’t expect a masterpiece.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s very helpful. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But be careful, Doctor. My knees aren’t what they used to be. See? A little wobbly. But I can still walk, you know. Still got some life in these old legs.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That was very helpful. Now, I’d like to review your medications and allergies, just to be sure we have everything correct. You mentioned taking pills for high blood pressure. What is the name of the medication?
PATIENT: The name… the name… My wife handles all that, you know. She keeps the pills organized. I just take them. But… I think it's… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. That sounds right. A little white pill. And… sometimes I take Ibuprofen for my knees. Over the counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. My wife makes a mean Khmer curry, you know. Spicy stuff. I can handle it. She always makes sure it's not too spicy, though. She worries about my stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Based on our conversation and the brief examination, you're experiencing some memory difficulties, irritability, and some instability with your balance. The clock drawing and recalling the three words were also a bit challenging. These symptoms, combined with your family history, raise some concerns. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. I recommend we order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other potential causes. I also think it would be beneficial to get a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work? A brain scan…? Sounds… serious. My wife… she’ll want all this done, of course. She’s always been the sensible one. I just… don't want to be told anything bad, you know? But… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle. And don't poke too much. My knees, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. We will be as gentle as possible. We'll take things one step at a time. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood work today. We can schedule the MRI for next week. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist. They specialize in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system and can provide a more in-depth evaluation. I also want to discuss some strategies to help manage your symptoms at home, such as keeping a daily calendar, writing down important information, and staying physically active. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? More doctors… Alright. If you think it’s necessary. And… what about the pills? Should I stop taking them? The Lisinopril? My wife said I shouldn’t change anything without asking. And… what if it’s… bad? What if it’s like my father?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Lason. No, please do not stop taking your Lisinopril without talking to me first. It’s important to continue taking your medication as prescribed. We need to rule out other potential causes before making any changes to your treatment plan. Regarding your concerns about your father, I understand your anxiety. It’s natural to be worried. However, it's important to remember that everyone is different. We don't know what's going on yet, and it’s possible it’s something completely different than what your father experienced. That's why it's crucial to get a proper diagnosis. The neurologist will perform a thorough evaluation and will be able to provide you with a clearer picture of your condition and discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I want to assure you that we will be here to support you every step of the way. We will answer your questions, address your concerns, and provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: I… I think that’s all for now. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And… tell my wife I’ll be alright. She worries too much. Thank you, Doctor Alanes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. We will do our best to make the process as comfortable as possible. And I will certainly let your wife know that you’re doing alright. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood work and schedule your MRI appointment. She will also provide you with some information about the neurologist’s office. Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Lason. Take care.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you.
