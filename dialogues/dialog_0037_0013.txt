DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… hard to explain, really. I just… can’t seem to get everything out when I go to the bathroom. It just… stops. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, I understand. It sounds frustrating and uncomfortable. When you say it "stops," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I feel like I gotta go, you know? Like there’s still something in there. I push, and… not much comes out. Then I gotta wait and try again. It takes a long time sometimes, and it feels… strained. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s definitely not normal. I just… don’t empty all the way, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does make sense. It sounds like you're experiencing incomplete bladder emptying, and that straining is concerning. To get a clearer picture, let's go through some details. About how often are you urinating throughout the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually… maybe every two or three hours? It’s hard to say exactly. I drink a fair bit of water, you see. Always have. Lived near the river my whole life, good water. But… now I find myself going more often, even if I haven’t had much to drink. It’s like… the feeling is there, even when it shouldn't be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency even with consistent water intake. And you mentioned it’s been happening for about a month. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself – is it weaker, hesitant, or does it spray in different directions?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. It’s not as strong as it used to be. More of a… trickle, really. And it doesn’t go straight like it did before. Sort of… wobbly, I guess. I didn't really pay much attention at first, just thought I was getting old. But now… well, now it’s bothering me enough to come see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, that's helpful information. Weak stream and hesitancy are important to note. Have you experienced any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said before, it’s not painful. It's more… a discomfort, a feeling of… fullness, even after I’ve tried to go. No burning or anything like that. It just… doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Alright. No burning or pain, just incomplete emptying and a sense of fullness. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, sir. Haven't seen any blood. Everything looks… normal, color-wise. It's just the feeling afterwards that's the problem. Like there's still a lot left in there, even when I push and push. I don't want to be a bother, Doctor, but it's… worrying me.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Hilber, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. It's important to investigate these things. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, prostate problems, or any neurological issues?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, worked hard all my life. No prostate problems that I know of, and nothing wrong with my nerves, as far as I can tell. My wife… she passed away a few years back, and she always took care of the medical stuff. I don’t remember much of what she told me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your wife must have been very difficult, and it's understandable you might not recall all the details of your medical history. We can work through it. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… I broke my leg when I was a young man, fell off a boat. Had to have surgery to fix it, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, no. I've been lucky, I guess. Mostly just little things, colds and flu, nothing serious enough to need a hospital stay.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken leg surgery in the past. And you mentioned taking medication for your blood pressure. What medication are you currently taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think it’s called… Lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. I take… ten milligrams, once a day, in the morning. I’ve been taking it for… oh, maybe five years now? It seems to be working alright, my blood pressure hasn't been a problem since I started.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. I've always been able to take most things without any trouble. My wife always said I was a tough old Yupik man! But I do get a little… sleepy sometimes after taking the blood pressure pills. Nothing too bad, just a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And some mild drowsiness with the Lisinopril. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. My grandfather always warned me about it. Said it would steal your breath and your strength. I listened to him. Always liked being able to breathe good, especially when I’m out on the river.
DOCTOR: Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe on a Saturday night. Nothing heavy, and not every week. Mostly just a social thing, you know? I don’t drink to excess. My wife didn’t like it much, so I didn’t do it often when she was around.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol consumption. And finally, do you have any family history of kidney problems, bladder cancer, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My mother… she had some trouble with her kidneys when she was older, but I don't know much about it. She didn't talk about it much. And my father… he was a strong man, never seemed to have any health problems. As for prostate issues… I don't know. Nobody ever talked about those things in my family. We were a quiet people, mostly kept to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Hilber. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. We’ll also check a urine sample. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Well… that sounds like a lot. The… the digital exam… that doesn't sound very comfortable, Doctor. Is it… necessary? I’m not a fan of doctors poking around down there, if you know what I mean. But if it’s important, I guess I can do it. I just… don't like the idea of it. And the urine sample, that’s alright, I can manage that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s not the most comfortable exam, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel apprehensive. However, a digital rectal exam is an important part of evaluating the prostate, especially given your symptoms of weak stream and incomplete emptying. It allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate and check for any abnormalities. It’s a quick exam, and I will explain everything as I go and stop if you’re uncomfortable at any point. We can discuss alternatives, but they won't provide the same level of information. For example, a PSA blood test can indicate prostate issues, but it's not always accurate and can sometimes lead to unnecessary biopsies. If you're willing, we can proceed with the exam, and I’ll do my best to make you as comfortable as possible. If you’d prefer to skip it, we can proceed with the urine sample and a PSA blood test, but I would recommend a referral to a urologist for further evaluation. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I… I guess I can do it. If you say it’s important, and you’ll explain everything… and you promise to be gentle. I just… don't like the idea of it. But I want to know what’s going on, so… go ahead. But please, be careful. And tell me what you're doing as you go, okay?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. I appreciate your willingness to proceed. I promise to be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to have you lie on your side, with your knees bent. This will help you relax. Then, I’ll apply a small amount of lubricant to my gloved finger and gently insert it into your rectum. I’ll be feeling the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. I’ll also be checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. It might feel like you have the urge to urinate, but that’s normal. It shouldn’t be painful, but if you feel any discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. Just… go slow. And like you said, tell me what you’re doing. I’m… I’m a little nervous, to be honest. But I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle. And don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. I’m just applying a little lubricant now. This will make it more comfortable. Alright, I’m gently inserting my finger now. Just relax as much as you can. I’m feeling your prostate gland now. It feels… slightly enlarged, but not significantly so. The texture is… a little firm, but not hard. There’s no obvious tenderness. I’m just gently rotating my finger to get a feel for the entire gland. Alright, that's all done. It was very quick. I didn't feel anything particularly concerning, but the slight enlargement and firmness are worth investigating further. Now, let’s collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions, and I’ll have you go to the restroom. The sample will help us rule out any infection or other abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. Thank you, Doctor. It wasn’t as bad as I thought, but I’m still glad it’s over. A urine sample sounds good. I can do that. Just tell me what I need to do. And… what did you mean by “investigating further”? What happens now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad it wasn't too uncomfortable. For the urine sample, just try to collect a mid-stream sample. That means you start urinating, then collect the sample about halfway through. This helps us get a cleaner sample. I’ll leave you alone to do that, and I'll be right outside when you’re finished. By "investigating further," I mean we'll need to do some additional tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. The urine sample will help rule out infection. We should also check your PSA level, which is a blood test that can indicate prostate issues. Based on those results, we may need to consider a referral to a urologist for further evaluation, such as an ultrasound or even a biopsy, but let’s not jump to conclusions yet. We'll take things one step at a time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that makes sense. A blood test… and maybe a… a specialist? It sounds like a lot. But… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I just… want to know what’s going on. I don’t want it to be anything serious. I’ll go do the… the sample now. Just let me know if there’s anything else I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. Take your time. I’ll be right outside. And please don't hesitate to call out if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
