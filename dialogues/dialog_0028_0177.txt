DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Genard, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Jimmi. You gotta speak up, dear. My ears ain't what they used to be. What's this about anyway? I don't remember makin' an appointment.
DOCTOR: Well, the scheduling department says you have an appointment today. It's… sometimes difficult to keep everything straight. Now, let’s just get to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Get to what? What are you talkin' about? I been comin' to doctors my whole life, and they always tell you what's goin' on. Not just... "get to it." You new here? This ain't very polite.
DOCTOR: Look, I have patients waiting. Let's just start with why you are here today. What brought you in?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… it's kinda embarrassing. It’s… down there. Something’s… leakin'. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. And it smells funny. I ain't been with nobody in… well, a long time. So I don’t know what it is. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, this whole thing is just silly.
DOCTOR: Right. Incontinence. It’s… common at your age. Though, frankly, hygiene is the first step. Now, is this… constant leakage, or does it happen with exertion?
PATIENT: Exer… what now? You talkin' fast again. Constant? Like all the time? No, not all the time! It happens when I… when I go to the bathroom. And sometimes after, a little bit. Not a flood, mind you. Just… a dribble. It's very bothersome, especially when I'm wearin' my good clothes. You understand? This is why I don't like doctors. Always usin' big words.
DOCTOR: So, it's urinary leakage associated with urination. And post-void dribbling. We need to rule out a few things. Have you had any urinary tract infections recently?
PATIENT: Urinary… what now? Infections? I don’t even know what that is. I get a little sick sometimes, like a cold. But I haven’t been to the hospital in… oh, goodness, years. Maybe twenty years. I just take some tea and rest. Usually gets rid of it. Honestly, I don't know what you're askin' me. You want to know if I've been sick? Everyone gets sick sometimes! Is this about a cold? Because it ain't a cold. It's… down there. Like I told you.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's try this differently. Any burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burnin'? No, not burnin'. It just… feels weird. Like somethin's not emptyin' all the way. And like I said, it smells funny. Not like tea, if that makes sense. More… fishy, maybe? I don't know. This is a very personal question, you know. I don't appreciate bein' asked these things. It’s just… uncomfortable. Are you sure you're a real doctor?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I assure you I am. Now, let's do a quick examination. It’s necessary to assess the situation. It won't take long. Just lie down on the examination table. We need to rule out a simple prolapse. It’s… common.
PATIENT: Prolapse? What in the world is a prolapse? Sounds awful! Lie down? On that thing? No, thank you. I ain't lyin' down for nobody. Especially not someone who keeps askin' me these rude questions and usin' big words. And common or not, I don't want you lookin' at… down there. I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much. Maybe it'll just go away on its own. I’ve had things go away on their own before. This is ridiculous. I’m leavin’.
DOCTOR: Fine. Leave then. But don't come back complaining when it gets worse. I've documented my recommendations. And frankly, you’re wasting my time. Next! .
PATIENT: .
