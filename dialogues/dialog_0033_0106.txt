DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s this foot. This awful, dreadful foot. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it just gets worse and worse, you know? It’s a sore, and it…well, it won’t heal. I’ve tried everything my daughter told me to, but nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Right. A sore that’s not healing. And how long exactly have you been dealing with this, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my daughter, Leilani, she's a nurse, you see, she keeps track of these things. But I'd say… at least six weeks. Maybe closer to eight. It started small, a little scratch I didn’t even pay attention to, and now… well, look at it! It’s quite alarming, really. I always did have trouble with my feet.
DOCTOR: And what, precisely, has Leilani had you do for it?
PATIENT: Oh, Leilani. She means well, you know. She had me soaking it in warm water with Epsom salts. And she bought one of those special creams… some kind of antibiotic ointment, I think. And bandages, of course. Lots of bandages. She's very particular about keeping it clean. But honestly, Doctor, it feels like it's getting worse with all this fuss. A simple scratch shouldn't turn into… this. Back in my day, we didn't need all these fancy creams and bandages. A little iodine and a clean cloth was all you needed.
DOCTOR: Right. And besides the topical treatments, any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, yes. Quite a bit, actually. It throbs, you know? Especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep. And when I try to walk… well, it's not a pleasant sensation, I assure you. I try not to put too much weight on it, but it’s difficult. I used to be so active, always walking around the village. Now… not so much. It’s very frustrating. And sometimes, the sheets stick to it, and it’s… well, it’s just dreadful.
DOCTOR: And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm... Let me think. Well, my legs feel a bit tingly sometimes. Not constantly, but now and then. And I've been rather thirsty lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And I get tired easily, you know? But honestly, Doctor, at my age, what doesn't ache or feel tired? It’s probably just… old age. But this foot… this foot is different. It’s worrying. It looks… angry. And I don’t like it one bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at this foot. If you could just sit on the examination table and remove your shoe and sock, please. I'll need to do a quick examination to assess the situation.
PATIENT: Very well. It’s a bit embarrassing, you know, showing a young doctor my… well, my old feet. But I suppose it’s necessary. There. Be careful, it's quite tender. Honestly, I haven't seen a foot look this bad since… well, since I was a young nurse in the hospital, and that was a long time ago. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There’s some… discoloration, and an open area. I’ll need to check your circulation. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your toes?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, a little bit, actually. Especially in the little toe and the next one. Not constantly, you understand. It comes and goes. It feels like… pins and needles, sometimes. And it’s colder than the other foot, I think. Though it’s hard to tell, really. You’re being very quick, Doctor. Are you sure you’re seeing everything you need to see? It’s a delicate matter, you know. And I don’t want to be kept waiting all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. I think I have enough for now. It appears you have a… wound on your foot. Given your age and… other symptoms, we'll need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order some blood work to check your sugar levels and assess your overall health. And possibly an X-ray, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Blood work? An X-ray? All this fuss for a simple sore? Back in my day, we didn't need all these fancy tests. A good look and a bit of common sense was usually enough. But very well, if you insist. Though I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have things to do, you know. And I certainly don't want to be stuck in a waiting room all afternoon. What exactly are you looking for in this blood work? It's alright to explain it to me in plain language, Doctor, I'm not a complete fool.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Cannington. We need to rule out diabetes and check for infection. Diabetes can cause poor circulation and slow healing, which would explain the wound. And the blood work will help us determine if there’s an infection present. It's just… a precaution. The lab will draw some blood, it shouldn't take long. And the X-ray is to rule out any bone involvement. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Well, goodness. I’ve never been told I have diabetes. My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat less sweets, but a little coconut cake never hurt anyone. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. No, I don't have any allergies, as far as I know. Although, my skin gets a bit sensitive sometimes, so perhaps latex? I wouldn't want to break out in a rash. And honestly, Doctor, I'm not thrilled about all this poking and prodding. I hope it's not going to be too painful. A simple sore, turning into this… it's all very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known latex allergy. We'll make a note of that. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, keep the wound clean and dry. And try to stay off your feet as much as possible. We’ll get the results back as soon as we can. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: “Keep the wound clean and dry.” As if I haven't been trying to do that all along! It's common sense, Doctor, honestly. And “stay off my feet…” well, that's easier said than done. I have a village to look after, you know. Alright, a follow-up appointment next week. But I expect a full explanation of these results, Doctor. None of this vague medical jargon. And if it is diabetes, I want to know exactly what I need to do about it. And quickly, if you please. I don't have all day to sit around waiting for a diagnosis. This whole thing is just… a bother, honestly. A simple sore shouldn't require all this fuss.
