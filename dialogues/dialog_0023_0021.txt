DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up. Not all of a sudden, it’s been getting worse for… oh, maybe a week, week and a half now. It hurts when I walk on it, especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Alright. A week and a half of increasing swelling and pain in your foot, worse in the mornings… Can you tell me where exactly on your foot the pain is located?
PATIENT: It’s mostly… right here, on the inside. <points to the arch of his left foot> Like, the part that touches the ground when I stand. And a little bit around my ankle bone, too. Not sharp pain, more of a… ache, you know? Like it’s bruised, even though I don’t remember hitting it or anything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Ache in the arch and around the ankle, no specific injury you recall. Is the swelling constant, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: It gets worse when I’ve been on my feet a lot. Like, if I’m doing errands or walking around the market. Then, when I sit down and put my feet up for a bit, it goes down some. Not all the way, though. Even when I’m resting, it’s still bigger than it used to be. I haven’t really tried anything for it yet, just trying to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, swelling increases with activity, improves with rest, but doesn't fully resolve. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just the ache and the swelling. It doesn't feel… cold or anything, if that makes sense. Just… puffy and sore. I did notice it feels a little warm to the touch sometimes, but I figured that was just 'cause it's hot outside. <gestures vaguely towards the window> It's been a scorcher this week.
DOCTOR: Warm to the touch… that's good to know. Now, let’s get a little more background. Have you had any injuries to this foot in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… I think when I was a younger man, maybe… thirty years ago, I twisted it playing soccer. Nothing serious, just a sprain, I think. I wrapped it up and it healed fine. Haven’t really had any trouble with it since then. No broken bones or anything like that, to my knowledge. I've definitely bumped it a few times over the years, but nothing that felt like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, a soccer injury decades ago, but no recent trauma. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never been told I have anything like that. I try to eat fairly healthy, mostly fish and rice. I don’t go to the doctor much, honestly. <shrugs> I just try to tough things out. My mother always said a little pain builds character. Not sure I agree with her anymore, though. This is starting to really bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take pills if I can avoid it. Just a little turmeric in my rice sometimes, that’s it. My sister swears it’s good for everything, but I don’t really count that as medicine. It just tastes good. <smiles faintly> I'm not a big fan of going to the pharmacy, to be honest. Too many people coughing and sneezing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam of your foot. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. <starts to carefully swing legs onto the examination table> Hopefully, this won’t be too bad. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but I guess it has to be done. Just tell me if it’s going to hurt, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm palpating your foot now. Tell me if anything is particularly painful. <pauses, continuing examination> Okay, I see some tenderness along the inside of your ankle and arch, and a bit of swelling. Your range of motion is slightly limited when you point your foot down. I'm also assessing your pulses. <checks dorsal pedis and posterior tibial pulses, finding them present but slightly diminished compared to the right foot>. Your pulses are present, but a little weaker than they should be. It doesn’t feel warm to me, maybe a little different than the other foot.
PATIENT: Oh, that part… yeah, that’s where it hurts. <winces slightly as Dr. Versace touches a specific spot on the inside of his ankle> Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And you’re right, it does feel different than the other one. I hadn’t really noticed that before, to be honest. What does that mean? Is it something serious? I need to be able to walk, you know? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the physical exam, it appears you may be experiencing tenosynovitis of the posterior tibial tendon, potentially with some early signs of dysfunction. The diminished pulses are also something we need to keep an eye on. It’s not necessarily serious in the sense of needing immediate surgery, but it is something we need to address to prevent it from getting worse. It could be impacting your ability to walk normally if it progresses. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone issues and assess the severity of the inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. I don’t like radiation, Doctor. Is it really necessary? Can't you tell just by looking at it? I mean, it’s swollen and it hurts, what more do you need to know? But… if you think it’s important… alright, I guess. But please, make it quick. And tell me what you’re looking for, alright? I like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about radiation. The amount of radiation from a single foot X-ray is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. We want to rule out any fractures or arthritis that could be contributing to your pain. I'm looking for any signs of bone spurs, joint damage, or stress fractures. It will help us determine the best course of treatment. I'll have the technician take the X-ray now. It should only take a few minutes. After that, we can discuss the results and a plan to get you back on your feet. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. If you say it’s not much radiation… and it will help… okay. Let's get it over with. The sooner I know what’s going on, the better. And please, tell me how to position my foot. I don’t want to have to do it over again. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you know. <sighs> Just get it done quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. The technician will guide you and explain the positioning. It will likely involve lying on your side with your foot flexed. They'll minimize the need for you to adjust. Just let them know if you're experiencing any discomfort. I'll be in the office reviewing your chart while you get the X-ray done. Once it’s complete, they’ll let me know, and we'll go over the results together. Please, take your time.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. <starts to carefully get off the examination table, wincing slightly> I will. And I will let them know if anything hurts. <pauses, looking towards the door> Hopefully, it won't be too long. <shuffles towards the door, looking a little apprehensive>
