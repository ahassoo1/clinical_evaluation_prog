DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I'm here, beyond being told I should be here. My husband, bless his heart, insisted. Something about…social healthcare? New to the area, you understand. It’s all rather…bothersome, really. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be a lot to navigate, especially moving to a new area. Don't worry, we'll take it at your pace. It sounds like your husband was proactive about scheduling this visit, which is wonderful. Even if you're not sure why you're here specifically, perhaps we can just do a general check-up and see if anything comes to light?
PATIENT: A “general check-up”? Really. I assure you, Doctor, I know my own body quite well enough. I haven’t been ill in…well, I can’t precisely recall when, but it's been a considerable time. My husband simply fusses over everything. Is there a form I need to fill out? Perhaps that would jog my memory as to why I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Of course. And you’re right to know your body well; that's excellent. A check-up isn’t necessarily about assuming something is wrong, but more about establishing a baseline and making sure everything stays right. Yes, we do have a form. It covers some basic medical history, allergies, medications…things like that. It might help us pinpoint what prompted the visit, or at least give us a good starting point. Let me grab one for you. It shouldn't take too long to fill out.
PATIENT: "Establishing a baseline." Honestly, the things they come up with these days. Very well, give me the form. But I assure you, it will likely be a complete waste of both our times. I rarely see a doctor, and when I do, it’s usually for…well, never mind. Just get it over with, please. And do hurry. I have luncheon plans.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No need to rush, but I understand your time is valuable. Feel free to take as long as you need. I'll be right outside if you have any questions. Just so you know, it asks about any current medications you're taking, allergies, and a bit about your past medical history – anything you recall, of course. We can always skip sections if it’s difficult to remember.
PATIENT: "Past medical history." As if I’m some frail invalid! Honestly. Very well. I suppose I can manage some of this. Though I doubt anything of significance will come to mind. It was…a long time ago, you see. And I’ve always been remarkably healthy. Though my husband does insist I take a vitamin supplement…something about Vitamin D. Honestly, the man worries over nothing. Now, where does it ask about…luncheon arrangements? Oh, never mind. It’s a medical form, not a social calendar.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Candice. No need to rush. And if anything is difficult to recall, just leave it blank or write down what you do remember. We can always discuss it further. I’ll be just outside if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: This is…utterly ridiculous. “Family history of…” Really! I barely remember my own grandmother, let alone her ailments. And this question about…“emotional wellbeing”? What sort of question is that? It’s simply…invasive. . Honestly, I’ve never understood this obsession with…feelings. A good, strong constitution and a sensible diet – that’s all one needs. There. Finished. Though I doubt any of this will be of the slightest use. Now, can we please get this over with?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Candice. I appreciate you taking the time to fill this out. It gives me a little bit of a starting point. I see you left a few sections blank, which is perfectly alright. We can certainly talk through those, or just move forward. Before we do, could you just confirm your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: “A little bit of a starting point”? It's hardly a comprehensive biography, is it? And frankly, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance of dredging up ancient history. As for my date of birth… …August 12th, 1946. Though why you need to know that is beyond me. Honestly, the paperwork these days is simply…excessive. Now, can we finally proceed? I have a luncheon date, you know. And I do try to be punctual.
DOCTOR: Thank you. August 12th, 1946. Just confirming. Alright. Well, I see you haven’t been to a doctor recently, and you mentioned feeling generally healthy. Perhaps we can start with a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline as we discussed?
PATIENT: A “quick physical exam”? Honestly, the indignity of it all. I assure you, Doctor, there’s absolutely nothing to find. But… …very well. If it will appease your…protocols. But do make it quick, please. And no prodding or poking, if you don’t mind. I have a rather sensitive constitution. Now, what precisely does this “exam” entail? And can we at least sit down during this ordeal? I do dislike standing for extended periods.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can absolutely do this while you’re seated. It’s quite routine. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Just so you know, I’ll explain everything as I go. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we’ll stop immediately. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: "Check my reflexes"? Honestly, am I being assessed for…senility? This is getting increasingly insulting. But… …very well. If you insist. But do be gentle, as I said. And please, no surprises. I dislike being startled. . And do explain everything, as you promised. I expect a full account of your…findings. Now, get on with it. But quickly, please. My luncheon date awaits.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. This helps me assess the rhythm and strength of your heartbeat, and listen for any unusual sounds in your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. And again… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds detected. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Honestly, the coldness of that…instrument. And the constriction of that…band. It’s simply…unpleasant. Are you quite finished with this…auscultation? And what precisely did you discover? Was my heart “irregular” as you probed about? I do have a perfectly healthy constitution, you know. My husband insists on it. Though he does worry excessively. Now, can we please move on? I have a luncheon date, you know, and I do try to be punctual. This…prodding and poking is simply…unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. We can keep an eye on it. It's often elevated in a clinical setting, so it’s not necessarily indicative of a problem. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your ears and throat. I’ll just use a light and a tongue depressor. It’s very quick. If you could just open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: “Slightly elevated”? What precisely does that mean? Is my circulation compromised? Am I on the verge of a…stroke? Honestly, the things they come up with these days. Do hurry, please. I do not relish having foreign objects inserted into my…oral cavity. And please, be gentle. I have sensitive gums. Now, get on with it. But quickly, please. My luncheon date awaits. And I do try to be punctual.
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear and healthy on both sides. Your throat is a little red, but there’s no sign of infection. It could just be a mild irritation. Now, I’d like to just quickly feel your abdomen. I’ll just gently press in a few different areas to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It’s very quick. Just lie back comfortably, please. I'll start on your right side. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: "Mild irritation"? What precisely is irritating my throat? Am I coming down with some dreadful…illness? Honestly, the things they come up with these days. "Gently" is the operative word, Doctor. And do not press too hard. I have a rather delicate constitution, you know. And please, be quick about it. My luncheon date awaits. Now, get on with it. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen feels soft and there's no tenderness or any masses I can feel. That's good. Okay, just a little bit higher now… and on your left side… Everything feels normal. Now, just one final thing. I'd like to check your reflexes. This is just to assess your nervous system function. It’s very quick.
PATIENT: “Nervous system function”? Am I having a…breakdown? Is my cognitive ability compromised? Honestly, the things they come up with these days. "Very quick" is the operative word, Doctor. And please, be gentle. I have sensitive nerves, you know. And do not startle me. Now, get on with it. But quickly, please. My luncheon date awaits. And I do try to be punctual. This…prodding and poking is simply…unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be very gentle. I’m just going to tap lightly on your knee with this hammer. You don’t need to do anything, just relax. It’s a perfectly normal reflex. Good. That’s a normal response. And on this side… also normal. Okay, that’s all the physical exam for now. Everything appears normal. Would you like me to summarize my findings?
PATIENT: “Normal”? What precisely does “normal” mean? Am I not supposed to be experiencing any…age-related decline? Honestly, the things they come up with these days. “Summarize”? Is there something…wrong? Are you about to tell me I’m…incurably ill? Very well. But do be concise. I have a luncheon date, you know. And I do try to be punctual. This…prodding and poking has simply…unacceptable. Get on with it. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. To summarize: Your heart and lungs sound clear, your blood pressure is slightly elevated but not significantly concerning, your ears and throat appear normal, your abdomen is soft and non-tender, and your reflexes are intact. Overall, everything appears normal. The slight elevation in your blood pressure is something we can monitor. It's often higher in a clinical setting, and can be influenced by stress and anxiety. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: "Stress and anxiety"? Honestly, the implication! I am a perfectly calm and collected individual. Though I must admit, this entire…ordeal has been rather…stressful. “Monitor”? What precisely does that mean? Will I need to return for further…prodding and poking? Very well. I have one question. And it is this: Will this…monitoring interfere with my luncheon plans? And do you have any recommendations for a good hat shop? I simply must have a new hat for the occasion. Now, answer quickly, please. My luncheon date awaits.
DOCTOR: “Monitoring” simply means checking your blood pressure periodically – perhaps at your next check-up, or you could check it at home if you’d like. It doesn’t require any further “prodding and poking,” as you put it. It’s just a precaution. As for a hat shop… let me see. There’s a lovely boutique called “Millinery Moments” just off Main Street. They have a beautiful selection and a very helpful staff. I believe they're open until 5 pm today. Is there anything else I can help you with?
PATIENT: “Millinery Moments,” you say? Very well. That is…useful information. Though I do hope they have something…suitable. I simply must have a hat that complements my ensemble. No, I believe that is all. You have answered my questions…adequately. Though I must say, this entire experience has been rather…disconcerting. Very well. I suppose I shall be leaving now. I have a luncheon date, you know. And I do try to be punctual. Thank you for your…assistance. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Certainly. It was a pleasure meeting you, Candice. I’m glad I could help, even if it was just with a hat shop recommendation. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And enjoy your luncheon! Have a wonderful day.
