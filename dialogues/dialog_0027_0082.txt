DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. I... need to go somewhere. For work. Lots of flying. My wife... she always took care of the... the shots. Before. Now I gotta come here. I don't even know what I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you need vaccinations for travel, and you're usually assisted by your wife. That's perfectly alright. We can definitely figure this out. Just to be clear, do you know where you’ll be traveling, and for how long?
PATIENT: Uh... Nepal. I'm going back to Nepal. It's... work. A few months, maybe? I don't really know exactly. My boss just said "go". He didn't say how long. It's... complicated.
DOCTOR: Nepal… right. Okay. And have you been to Nepal before?
PATIENT: Yes. Many times. Before... you know. But… it's been a while. Things change, right? I don't remember what I got before. Honestly, I don't really pay attention to those things. My wife… she always knew. She took care of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It has been a while, and recommendations can change. And it's completely understandable that you're not sure. Let's start with your past medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Uh... no. Not really. I'm… I'm pretty healthy. Always been strong. Worked hard all my life. No… nothing like that. Maybe a little back pain sometimes, but that's just from the work. Lifting things. Heavy things. Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No major medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. Not even a tooth pulled, if you can believe it. I just... don't get sick. Or, I didn't, before. It's been... hard. Everything's hard now.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. I understand things have been difficult. We don't need to go into detail if you're not comfortable. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of serious illness in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh... my mother, she... she had some problems. With her heart. When she was old. Very old. And my father... he worked in the mountains. Lots of dust. He had cough. Bad cough. But... that's it, I think. Not much else. My wife’s family... I didn't know them very well.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart problems in your mother, cough in your father. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. Never have. Just... strong tea sometimes. For… for everything. But that's not a medicine, right? Just tea. My wife... she used to make it. Special tea.
DOCTOR: No, tea doesn't count as medication. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh... no. I don't think so. Maybe... maybe a little itchy sometimes with dust. But that's not an allergy, right? Everyone gets itchy with dust. Especially in the mountains. I don't… I don't remember being allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Okay. Just to confirm, you said you're traveling to Nepal for work, for a few months. Can you tell me a little bit about the type of work you’ll be doing, and where in Nepal you'll be going?
PATIENT: Uh... building things. Roads, mostly. In the… the hills. Near Pokhara. It’s... remote. My boss says it's important. Very important. I don't ask questions. I just… build. It's what I do. It's dangerous work. Lots of… accidents. But… I'm strong. I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Okay, building roads near Pokhara. That is remote, and can be dangerous work. Alright. Before we discuss vaccinations, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Uh... fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step over here and we'll get started. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Then I’ll check a few reflexes. It won’t take long. Take a deep breath for me, Odell. And another… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90, but not drastically so. Ears look clear. Throat is clear as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Overall, you seem to be in good physical condition. But the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor. Now, let's discuss the vaccinations you'll need for Nepal.
PATIENT: Uh... okay. Vaccinations. My wife... she took care of all that. What do I need? Tell me. Just tell me what I gotta get.
DOCTOR: Alright. For Nepal, considering you'll be working in a more remote area, I recommend a few vaccinations. Routine vaccinations are important, so we'll want to make sure you're up to date on tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – that's Tdap. You'll also need a Hepatitis A vaccination, and a Typhoid vaccination. Because of the risk of malaria in some areas, I recommend discussing preventative medication with a specialist as well. And considering the possibility of exposure, I'd recommend a rabies pre-exposure vaccine. It's a series of three shots. We can start with Tdap and Hepatitis A today. Rabies is a series, so we can schedule those. Do you have any questions about any of those?
PATIENT: Uh... three shots? For a dog bite? That seems… a lot. And what's this… Ty-phoid? Is that… serious? My wife never said anything about three shots. Just one or two. Maybe. I don't know. I don’t even know what these things do. What are they for? Just… explain it. In simple terms.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. Let me explain. Tdap protects against tetanus, which you can get from dirty wounds, diphtheria, which is a serious throat infection, and pertussis, which is whooping cough. It’s a standard booster to keep you protected. Hepatitis A is a liver infection you can get from contaminated food or water. We want to protect you from that, especially if you’ll be eating outside of established restaurants. As for Rabies, it is a series of three shots. It's a precaution because rabies is present in Nepal, and it's a very serious, almost always fatal, infection if you're exposed through a bite from an infected animal. The series gives your body time to build up immunity before you're exposed. While the risk of a bite is relatively low, the consequences are severe. Typhoid is a bacterial infection you get from contaminated food and water. It causes a high fever and abdominal pain. It's also important to protect against while travelling. These vaccinations are about minimizing risk and protecting you from potentially serious illnesses. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Uh... three shots for a dog bite... that still seems crazy. And my wife... she never said anything about all this. She just… took care of it. I don't like needles. Never have. Can't I just… be careful? Wash my hands? I don't want to get sick. And I definitely don’t want a bunch of shots.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Odell. No one likes needles. And being careful with hygiene is definitely important. However, relying solely on that isn't enough, especially considering the risks in Nepal. Rabies isn’t just from dog bites – any mammal can carry it. And even with thorough washing, there’s a risk of exposure. These vaccinations aren’t about assuming you will get sick, it’s about preparing your body in case you do encounter something. Look, we can start with Tdap and Hepatitis A today, and then discuss the Rabies series further. We can even talk about splitting up the doses to make it less uncomfortable. And I can provide you with information on resources for travelling safely in Nepal, including how to avoid exposure to potential infections. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Uh... alright. Just... Tdap and... Hep-A. Today. No rabies. Not today. And... tell me about being safe. What should I watch out for? What kind of food… what kind of water? Just… tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tdap and Hepatitis A today. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the Rabies vaccine later, if you decide you want it. Here are the details for the vaccinations we’re giving you today, and this handout provides detailed information on how to stay safe in Nepal. It covers things like drinking bottled or boiled water, avoiding street food, protecting yourself from mosquito bites, and what to do if you get injured. It's really important to stick to bottled or boiled water, and avoid ice. Be cautious about eating raw or undercooked food. And always wear insect repellent, especially during dawn and dusk. I also recommend bringing a basic first-aid kit with antiseptic wipes, bandages, and pain relievers. If you get injured, clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water, and seek medical attention if it’s deep or shows signs of infection. And finally, I recommend you consult with a travel specialist about malaria prevention. I can give you a referral to Dr. Sharma. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Uh... Dr. Sharma? For... malaria? Is it bad? And... what if I get hurt? Far away? No doctor? This is... a lot. I just want to build roads.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a lot. Malaria is a serious, but preventable, infection transmitted by mosquitoes. Dr. Sharma is a specialist in travel medicine, and can prescribe you medication to help prevent it. It’s best to be prepared, even if you don't end up needing it. As for getting hurt… it's a valid concern. If you get injured, even a minor cut, clean it thoroughly with soap and water, and cover it with a bandage. If it’s deep, or shows signs of infection – redness, swelling, pus, fever – seek medical attention as soon as possible. You should also have travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and evacuation. I can write a note for your insurance company explaining your vaccinations and any potential medical concerns. And remember, if you're working in a remote area, it's always best to have a communication plan in place – let someone know where you are and how to reach you. We’ve covered a lot today. Do you feel comfortable with the plan, or would you like me to go over anything again?
PATIENT: Uh... insurance. Okay. And... the doctor. Malaria. I'll... I'll call them. I think. This is... too much. I just want the shots. Get it over with. Let's... just do the shots.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can definitely get the shots done. Just relax, and take a deep breath. This will just be a little pinch. There you go. All done. You may experience some mild soreness and fatigue, but it should subside within a day or two. Just keep the bandages clean and dry. Here’s the instruction sheet with details about potential side effects and how to manage them. I’ve also scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss any concerns you may have. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any severe side effects. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Odell?
PATIENT: Uh... no. I think that's... everything. Thank you. I gotta go. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a safe trip, Odell. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care.
