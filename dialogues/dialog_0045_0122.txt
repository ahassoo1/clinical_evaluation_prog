DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing…small gaps. In my memory. It worries me, because I manage many properties, and I must remember details. I am 53, and…well, my blood pressure is not good.
DOCTOR: Memory gaps, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Not big things, you understand. More like…forgetting why I entered a room. Or the name of a flower. Small things, but they are…more frequent now. It’s unsettling. I do not like feeling…unreliable. Especially with the estates I oversee.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said your blood pressure isn’t good?
PATIENT: Yes. The doctor…my previous doctor…told me it was high. Very high. I take pills, of course, but sometimes…I forget if I have taken them already. It is this forgetting that is the problem, not necessarily the pressure itself, but the… uncertainty. It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, high blood pressure, medication…and some memory issues. Are these memory issues…new?
PATIENT: Relatively new, yes. Perhaps… six months, maybe? Before that, I had a very good memory. I could recall dates, names, everything. Now… it feels like a fog sometimes. It is not constant, but enough to cause me concern. I do not want to become…a burden.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Sometimes, a slight…dizziness. Not falling-down dizziness, but a lightheadedness. And occasionally, I have headaches. Not severe, but…a dull ache at the back of my head. It is difficult to say if these are related to the memory, or simply…life.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother…she had heart problems, yes. Very bad. She passed when she was 68. My father…he was healthy, very strong, until the very end. No memory problems that I recall. It was mostly his heart. And my brother… he is still living, but we do not speak often. I do not know his medical situation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? I am widowed, Doctor. My husband passed five years ago. I live alone. I manage the properties, which keeps me very busy. I do not have many hobbies, truthfully. It is mostly work, and…remembering things. Before…before my husband, we travelled a lot. But that was long ago. I do not drink, I do not smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a vitamin D supplement. The sun is not strong enough here, my neighbor told me. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. But that is only when I need it, not every day. I believe that is all. No other prescriptions. I try to avoid medication if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and cognitive function. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I want to understand what is happening. The forgetting…it frightens me. Please, do whatever is necessary. I want to be…capable.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is… elevated, as expected. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions now, just to assess your memory and cognitive function. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today is… August 2nd. The year… …2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I think. I am quite certain. It is difficult to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you tell me the names of three previous presidents of the United States?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. George Washington, of course. And… Abraham Lincoln. Oh… and… …Franklin Roosevelt. Yes, Franklin Roosevelt. I believe those are three. It is… hard to think. It feels like the information is… just out of reach.
DOCTOR: Can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please, tell me the words. I will do my best. I am trying very hard.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Now, repeat those three words back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… Oh dear. Penny… No, wait… table… apple… I am so sorry, Doctor. I… I cannot recall the third word. It is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot say it. This is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of high blood pressure, memory issues, and the results of this brief assessment, I suspect you may be experiencing some degree of vascular cognitive impairment, potentially related to hypertension. It's not a definitive diagnosis, but it's something we need to investigate further. We'll start with some blood work to rule out other causes. I'm also going to order an MRI of your brain to look for any evidence of structural changes. However, based on your insurance status and location, access to an MRI may be limited. I’m not saying this is Alzheimer’s or anything like that, but we need to rule things out. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a detailed daily schedule, writing down important information, and avoiding stress as much as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Vascular…cognitive impairment? Related to the blood pressure? So, my forgetting…it is not simply age? An MRI… that sounds… expensive. And difficult to arrange. I… I do not have insurance, as you know. I understand about the blood work. And I will try to keep a schedule… and avoid stress. But… what if the MRI is not possible? What then? Will we not know what is happening? I… I need to understand. I simply must know. It is very frightening to feel… uncertain.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Alvara, I understand your concerns. But without an MRI, it’s difficult to get a clear picture of what’s going on. I can write a referral to the nearest hospital, but whether they'll accept you without insurance is another matter. Rural clinics have limited resources, and frankly, I can only do so much. In the meantime, we'll monitor your blood pressure closely. If it gets significantly worse, we may need to consider medication adjustments. And… honestly?
PATIENT: And? What then? What if the medication doesn’t work? What if… it gets worse? I am alone, Doctor. Truly alone. I need to be… capable. I need to manage things. If I cannot remember… if I become… a burden…
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Alvara, I’m a family doctor. I can manage your blood pressure, order some basic tests. But I’m not a neurologist, and I can’t perform miracles. If your memory continues to decline, you may need to consider assisted living or other long-term care options. It’s not what anyone wants to hear, but it’s a reality. For now, let's focus on the blood work and seeing if we can get a handle on your blood pressure. I'll write a referral for the MRI, but don’t get your hopes up. And honestly?
PATIENT: And? What about… now? What can I do now? Besides wait… and hope… and worry? Is there anything… anything at all… I can do to help myself? Any exercises… any foods… any changes to my life… to slow things down? Please, Doctor. Tell me something. I do not want to simply… give up.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Alvara, there's no magic cure. But you can try to maintain a healthy lifestyle: regular exercise, a balanced diet, and mentally stimulating activities. Puzzles, reading, social interaction—anything to keep your brain active. But frankly, it may not make a significant difference. I'm going to write a prescription for a mild blood pressure medication. We'll start with a low dose and see how you respond. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in one month to monitor your progress. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Just… the blood work, the prescription… and the follow-up appointment. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I understand. I will… try my best. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will draw your blood before you leave. Have a good day, Ms. Alvara. .
