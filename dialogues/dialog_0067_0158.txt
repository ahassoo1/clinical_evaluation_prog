DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Pfennig, was it? Yes, well, it’s about a letter. A pet ownership letter, they called it. For my… well, for my dog. Honestly, the whole thing seems a bit silly, but the landlord is being difficult. I just need something official, I suppose. Don't really know what all this entails.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Landlords sometimes require documentation for emotional support animals or service dogs. It’s not uncommon. So, to clarify, you’re looking for a letter verifying the need for your dog, is that correct?
PATIENT: Emotional support... yes, I think that's what they said. Look, I just… I got him a while back, and he’s good company, alright? I live alone, you see. A big house, it can be… echoey. He’s a good boy, doesn’t cause trouble. I don't know about needing him, exactly, but I’d rather not have to get rid of him over some paperwork. Is that… is that enough for a letter? I don’t really do well with explaining things, honestly. It’s all a bit much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye. You don't need to feel pressured to over-explain. It sounds like your dog provides you with valuable companionship, which is a very valid reason. To properly document this, I'll need to ask a few questions, just to get a better understanding of your situation. It's similar to how I would assess any other health concern. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Questions, huh? Well, alright. I suppose. As long as it’s not too… complicated. I'm not very good at remembering dates or specifics, if that matters. I get things mixed up easily, you see. It's just how my brain works. But I can tell you he's a big Labrador, very friendly, loves belly rubs… is that helpful? Honestly, I'm not sure what sort of things you need to know.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Wrye, and thank you for telling me about that. We can definitely work around that. No need to worry about precise dates. Just tell me what you can remember, and that's perfectly fine. Let's start with how long you’ve had your Labrador. Roughly, is that alright?
PATIENT: Roughly… hmm. Let me think. It was after… after my divorce, definitely. That was… oh goodness, must be… five, maybe six years ago? It was a very stressful time, you see. I needed… something. He was just a puppy then, a little ball of fluff. I got him from a rescue, I think. Or maybe a breeder… honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. But it’s been several years, for sure. He’s a grown dog now, a big one. Does that help? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Wrye. This is very helpful. So, approximately five to six years, and you acquired him around the time of your divorce. That gives me a good starting point. Now, can you tell me a little bit about how having your dog impacts your daily life?
PATIENT: Oh. Impacts… well, he makes me get up in the morning, that's for sure. I used to sleep right through, but he needs feeding and… walks. It's good, actually. Gets me out of the house. I talk to him, too. Sounds silly, I know, but he listens. Doesn’t interrupt, you see. And… honestly, the house feels less empty now. It’s just… quieter when he’s not around. I don’t have much family nearby, and friends… well, they have their own lives. He’s good company. Does that… is that the sort of thing you’re asking about? It feels a bit personal, talking about this, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye, and thank you for sharing that with me. It’s not silly at all. It sounds like he provides you with a great deal of emotional support and helps with your overall well-being. This is exactly the sort of thing I need to know. It’s important to understand the full picture. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your general health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: Oh. Health… hmm. Well, the doctor after the divorce… he prescribed something for my nerves, I think. Something to help me sleep. I didn't take it for very long, honestly. Made me feel… foggy. I just… stopped taking it. And… I went to see someone a few years back about… just feeling down, I suppose. But it was just a few sessions, nothing serious. They said I was just… adjusting. I don’t really like talking about these things, if I’m honest. It feels… exposing. I don’t want to be labeled or anything. Does that make sense? I just... prefer to keep things to myself.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Wrye. I understand your reluctance to discuss personal matters, and I want to assure you that anything you share with me will be kept confidential. You are in a safe space here. It sounds like you’ve experienced some challenges with anxiety and mood, and it’s good that you sought help in the past. Just to be clear, have you been diagnosed with a specific condition like generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… diagnosed? No, not officially. They never said anything official. Just… talked about stress and adjusting and… coping mechanisms. It was all very vague, honestly. The doctor after the divorce… he just wanted to get me on medication, I think. And the other one… she just listened and gave me some pamphlets. No formal diagnosis, no. I don’t like labels, you see. I just… get on with things. I try to be strong. Does that make sense? I don’t want to be seen as… unwell. I just… need this letter for the dog, that’s all. I don't want to dredge up the past.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Wrye. You've been very clear about that, and I respect your wishes. It sounds like you've managed things on your own for quite some time, and that's admirable. Now, just to complete a basic assessment, have you noticed any significant changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Oh goodness... changes? Well, my sleep is… okay. I sleep alright when the dog lets me. He likes to cuddle, you see. But sometimes he gets restless and… wakes me up. Appetite… well, I eat. Not as much as I used to, maybe. But I don’t really enjoy food, if that makes sense. And energy… well, I get tired easily. But that’s just… getting older, isn’t it? I don’t have the energy I used to, that’s for sure. I mostly just… potter around the house. It's quiet, you see. Does that... is that helpful? I'm not sure why you need to know all this. I just want the letter, so the landlord will leave me alone. Honestly, it's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Wrye, and thank you for sharing that with me. I understand your frustration, and I'm trying to gather all the necessary information to support your request. Given what you’ve told me about your emotional support from your dog, your past experiences with anxiety and mood, and the changes you’ve described in your sleep, appetite, and energy levels, I believe I have enough information to write a letter verifying the need for your dog as an emotional support animal. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… really? You think so? That would be… wonderful. Yes, please. Please write the letter. The sooner this is over, the better. Honestly, I just want my landlord to leave me alone. He’s been making me very anxious, constantly asking for paperwork. This whole thing has been… a lot. Yes, please write the letter. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I'm happy to help. It sounds like this has been a stressful situation, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a resolution. I will write a letter outlining your need for your dog as an emotional support animal, based on the information you’ve provided regarding your companionship and support, as well as your past experiences and current symptoms. I will also include a statement regarding the benefits of having your dog for your overall well-being. Just to be clear, this letter verifies the need for your dog as an emotional support animal, which may allow you to keep him despite your landlord’s requirements. However, it does not grant you any special rights or privileges beyond what is allowed by local and federal laws. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Local and federal laws… yes, I suppose. I don’t really understand all that. As long as it stops the landlord from making trouble, that’s all that matters. He keeps talking about restrictions and fees… it’s just exhausting. Yes, I understand. As long as the letter helps, that’s good enough for me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. When will it be ready? I don’t want to keep him waiting. He gets anxious when I’m gone for too long, you see.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Ms. Wrye. This letter should be sufficient for your landlord. It outlines your need for your dog as an emotional support animal and the benefits he provides for your well-being. I’ve also included a brief explanation of your rights under the Fair Housing Act, which may be helpful. It shouldn't take long for him to be happy to see you back. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Thank you. Thank you very much. It looks… official. Yes, that’s good. No, I don't think so. I think you've explained everything very clearly. I just… wanted this over with. Honestly, I'm just relieved. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. You’ve been very kind and understanding. I appreciate it very much. I think that’s all. I should go home and see my dog now. He’s probably wondering where I am. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I'm glad I could help. I’m sure your dog is very happy to have you home. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Have a wonderful day, and give your dog a belly rub for me.
