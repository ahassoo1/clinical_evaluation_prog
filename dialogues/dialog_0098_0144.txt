DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Bombara, is it? Yes, well… honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. She said I should get “checked out.” Something about… preventative things? I feel perfectly fine, you know. Perfectly fine. Though, my knees do ache a bit… but that’s just age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good of your daughter to be so thoughtful. Preventative care is very important, even when we feel perfectly fine. And yes, knee aches can certainly be a part of getting older, but we should still take a look just to be sure. So, Ms. Calvery, when you say your knees ache, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, it’s not a constant ache, you understand. More… when I’ve been on my feet for a bit. Or after I’ve been sitting for too long and then try to get up. It’s a dull sort of pain, not sharp. I used to be quite nimble, you know. Worked in the operating room for… oh, goodness, decades. Lots of standing then. Though, that was a long time ago. It’s probably nothing. Really. I just… don’t like making a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you were so active for so long. That’s often helpful. So, the pain is more related to activity, or changes in position… and it’s a dull ache, not sharp. And you mentioned working in the operating room for many years… was there any specific injury to your knees that you recall from that time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, injury… Hmm. Not that I remember, exactly. It was so long ago. Lots of twisting and turning, helping the doctors… and sometimes you’d bump into things, I suppose. Or someone would bump into you. It was a busy place, you know. Lots of hustle and bustle. I don’t recall any major falls or anything. Just…the usual bumps and bruises, I expect. It wasn’t a glamorous job, but it kept me on my feet. Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, I struggle to recall specifics from even last week sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Calvery. Memories can fade with time, and it sounds like you were very active in a demanding job. We’ll take a thorough look at your knees today. Besides the knee pain, are you experiencing any other aches or pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… my hands have been a bit stiff lately. Not all the time, but in the mornings, especially. It makes it difficult to button my blouses sometimes. I just figured it was arthritis. My mother had it, you know. Terrible pain she had. I’ve been trying to ignore it, really. I don’t want to start dwelling on things. Makes everything seem worse, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me about this, Ms. Calvery. Stiffness in the mornings, especially in your hands… and a family history of arthritis. We should definitely take a closer look at that as well. Do you notice any swelling or redness in your hands along with the stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm…redness, no. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes they feel a little…warm, perhaps? But not hot, you understand. And the swelling… well, maybe a little puffy around the knuckles. But it’s hard to say. I have rather… substantial hands, you know. Always have. It’s probably nothing, really. Just old age creeping in. I really don't want to bother you with all this. Are you sure I'm not just wasting your time?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Calvery. It’s my job to listen and assess, and you are not wasting my time. It’s much better to discuss these things now. So, some warmth and a little puffiness around the knuckles… that’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk about other things. Are you experiencing any fatigue, fever, weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Fatigue…well, who doesn't feel tired these days? I do get a bit…dragged out by the afternoon. But that's just getting older, isn't it? Fever? No, I don't think so. I haven't taken my temperature in ages. Weight loss… perhaps a pound or two, but nothing significant. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more. She worries too much, that girl. Appetite? No change there. I still enjoy my food, thank goodness. Though I do find myself getting full quicker than I used to. Now that I think about it, maybe that’s why I’ve lost a bit of weight… I just don’t eat as much at each meal. But it's probably nothing to worry about, right?
DOCTOR: It's good to know. So, some afternoon fatigue, feeling full quicker, but no fever or significant weight loss. That’s all helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder control?
PATIENT: Oh…goodness. Well… that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? Let me see… I suppose things aren’t quite as regular as they used to be. A little… unpredictable, perhaps. And… yes, I have to get up more often at night. But that’s just age, isn’t it? All the things… loosening up. I really don't like talking about these things. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. It’s just… what happens when you get old. Do we really need to discuss this further?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s all part of my job to ask these questions, and you’re doing the right thing by being honest with me. It’s important to have a complete picture of your health. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. High blood pressure… yes, the doctor told me years ago. Said I needed to watch my salt intake. I try, I really do. But everything tastes so bland without it! Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never been told that. Heart disease… well, my husband had a bit of a weak heart. But I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with anything myself. I had my gallbladder out years ago… that was a messy affair. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy when I was younger. That’s about it, I think. My memory is just terrible. Do you want me to ask my daughter? She keeps all the medical records, bless her heart. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Calvery. High blood pressure, gallbladder removal, and a hysterectomy. It’s good your daughter keeps those records; we can certainly take a look at them. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to get hives as a child, but I grew out of those. I take a little something for my blood pressure, as we discussed. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains. But no, no serious allergies. I’m very lucky that way. Though, I do get a bit… stuffy sometimes during the spring. But that's just the pollen, isn't it? Everyone gets that. It's really nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, just occasional spring stuffiness. And you're taking medication for your blood pressure. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult one. My mother, as I mentioned, had terrible arthritis. And my father… he had a weak heart. I think. He passed away when I was quite young. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she had something with her stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very involved with those things. My husband’s side… his father had diabetes, I believe. And his brother had something with his lungs. But honestly, I don't remember much about it. We weren't a very… medical family, you understand. We just… dealt with things as they came. It’s hard to say what runs in the family when no one really talked about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history, so it’s alright you don’t have a lot of details. Finally, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Smoke? Never! My husband tried it once, years ago, and I nearly threw him out! Alcohol… well, I might have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Very little. Just a small sip. And recreational drugs? Heavens no! I’m a respectable woman! I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees don’t allow for much of that anymore. I mostly watch television these days. And read… when my eyes aren’t bothering me. It’s a quiet life, you understand. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds… fine. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Though, I doubt you’ll find anything wrong. As I said, I feel perfectly fine. But… do what you need to do, dear. Just… be gentle with my knees, alright? They’re rather sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I'll be very gentle. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and again… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. That's something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s not a sharp pain, you understand. It’s more of a dull ache, like I said. But if I had to point… Right here, on the inside of my knee. And a little bit here, on the front. It’s worse when I’ve been standing for a while. Or after I’ve been sitting for too long. It doesn't swell up or anything. Just… aches. Is it bad? Do I need an injection? My daughter would be thrilled if I didn't have to have an injection. She hates needles.
DOCTOR: I feel some mild tenderness on the inside of both knees, and a little bit on the front, as you pointed out. There’s no significant swelling. Let’s check your range of motion. Could you please bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit… uncomfortable. Not painful, but… stiff. I can’t bend them as far as I used to. They just… don’t go as far. There… that’s about as far as they go. It feels… tight. Like they’re rusty or something. I used to be so nimble, you know. I could dance for hours. But now… it’s just a struggle to get out of a chair. Is it arthritis, dear? Is that what it is? My mother had terrible arthritis.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable you’re concerned about arthritis, given your mother's history. Your range of motion is slightly limited in both knees, and there is some crepitus – a grating sensation – when you bend them. That, combined with the tenderness and stiffness, does suggest some degree of osteoarthritis. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some X-rays of both knees. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh…X-rays? Heavens. Are they…safe? I’ve heard things about radiation. And will they…hurt? I really don't like being poked and prodded. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. If it will tell you what’s going on with my knees… yes, I suppose so. But please, be gentle. And make sure they don’t expose me to too much radiation. My daughter will be furious if I come home glowing in the dark.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Ms. Calvery. The amount of radiation from X-rays is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. We use the lowest possible dose, and the technician will be very careful to minimize your exposure. It won’t hurt at all – you'll just need to stand or lie still for a few moments while the pictures are taken. I’ll write the order for the X-rays now. The radiology department is just down the hall. They'll schedule you for an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and come up with a plan to manage your knee pain. In the meantime, I recommend you try to avoid activities that aggravate your pain, and you can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as long as you don't have any other medical conditions that would prevent you from taking them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… over-the-counter pain relievers… ibuprofen… yes, I’ve taken those before. They help a little, but not much. Avoiding activities… well, that’s difficult. I like to stay busy, you know. But… I’ll try. I’ll try to take it easy. And I’ll go get the X-rays… down the hall, you say? My daughter will be relieved that I’m finally getting something done about my knees. She's been nagging me about this for months. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to sit down for a moment. All this talk about knees has made mine ache even more.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. Please do. You’ve been very brave throughout this examination, and it’s perfectly alright to rest. The nurse will be in shortly to help you with the X-ray order and to make sure you’re comfortable. I’ll write up a summary of our discussion and the X-ray order, and I’ll see you again once the results are in. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe pain, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care, Ms. Calvery. And please, don’t push yourself too hard.
