DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I'm Dr. Pirl. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, to be honest, I just… wanted to check things out. See what’s what. Been feeling okay, mostly, but figured it couldn’t hurt, right? Just curiosity, I guess. I ain’t got nothing specific bothering me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Preventative care is always a good idea, Mr. Heindel. It's wise to establish a baseline when you're feeling well. Though, sometimes, "just checking things out" leads us to identify concerns we weren't initially aware of. To help me get a better understanding, could you elaborate a little on what "feeling okay" means to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Baseline… right. Well, I work on the boats, so I’m usually pretty active. No big pains or anything. Sleep alright, eat alright… I get tired, of course, it's hard work, but… normal tired. Everything kinda works, you know? Like, I can lift stuff, walk around, do my job. No shortness of breath or anything weird like that. I guess just… no complaints, really.
DOCTOR: Very good. That’s helpful to know. No significant changes in your energy levels, no recent weight loss or fever, no new aches or pains... You mentioned working on the boats. What kind of work do you do specifically?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I’m a sailor and a marine oiler. Mostly keeping the engines running smooth, fixing stuff when it breaks. Lots of lifting, climbing, greasy work… been doing it a few years now. Before that… well, it doesn't matter. It's pretty physical, though, that's for sure. Gets me moving, that’s what I like about it.
DOCTOR: I see. A physically demanding job. That’s useful information, Mr. Heindel. Now, to get a complete picture, I'd like to ask a few routine questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But nothing… serious. The doctors patched it up, it healed fine. And I had the usual shots when I was younger, you know, for school and stuff. But I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, honestly. No high blood pressure or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And have you ever had any surgeries, besides the arm when you were younger?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the arm, like I said. No surgeries. Never needed ‘em. I mean, I’ve got a few scars from bumps and scrapes on the boats, but nothing a doctor ever had to… cut open, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My mom… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. She passed away a few years ago. And my dad, he had… diabetes, maybe? He was always getting tired, had to watch what he ate. But other than that… not really. A lot of folks just get old, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful to know. It's not always easy to recall these things. Now, just a couple more questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to any medicine. I've taken some pain killers after a long day at work, but no problems. Strong as an ox, usually. No allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's excellent. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Just water and coffee to get me through the day. I ain’t one for pills, Doctor. Healthy as a horse, usually. I try to eat good when I can, but work gets busy, you know? Just the basics.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Heindel. That's all very helpful information. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and looking at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Overall, he appears to be in good general condition. Everything sounds good, Mr. Heindel. I’ll document these findings.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Sounds… good. So, everything’s okay? I was worried about… I don't know. Just getting old, I guess. Working hard.
DOCTOR: Your physical exam was unremarkable, Mr. Heindel. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your abdomen is normal to palpation. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which can be common with physical activity, but it’s not a significant concern at this time. However, given your family history of heart trouble and diabetes, and your physically demanding job, I do recommend a few follow-up tests just to establish a baseline and monitor your health proactively. Would you be open to having some blood work done to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood work sounds… smart. Proactive, like you said. If it helps make sure everything’s alright, then yeah. Let’s do the blood work. When can I get that done? And… how much does it cost?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order the blood work now. It will be a standard lipid panel and a complete metabolic panel. The cost is $125, but your Medicare should cover a significant portion of that, bringing your out-of-pocket expense to approximately $30. You can have it done at the lab just down the hall. They're open until 5:00 PM today. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: $30 sounds okay. Yeah, I can handle that. Down the hall, you said? Great. Is there anything else I need to do? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a 12-hour fast before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks for 12 hours prior to your appointment. Water is fine. Here is the lab order form. Please take this to the lab down the hall, and they will take care of everything. We’ll receive the results in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay, 12-hour fast. Got it. Water only. No, I think that’s it. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve been a big help. I was just getting a bit worried about nothing, probably.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Heindel. It’s always best to address any concerns proactively. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any changes in your health. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thanks, you too.
