DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're 87 years young. Please, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a waste of my time, if you want to know the truth. But my…ex-wife insisted. Something about…stress. Burnout, she called it. I’ve been a library science teacher for decades. Decades! It’s…exhausting dealing with these students these days. No respect for knowledge, none at all. I suppose that's what she means. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I see. Well, Mr. Schlatterer, while I appreciate your…frankness, it’s important we explore this “stress” in a bit more detail. Simply dismissing it isn’t particularly helpful. Perhaps you could elaborate on what specifically is causing you the most difficulty at work?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Everything is difficulty! The students, as I said. They spend more time on their…devices than with actual books. And the administration…always wanting “new programs” and “innovative approaches.” Honestly, it’s a circus. I just want to be left alone to teach. Is that too much to ask? They don't understand the value of proper cataloging anymore. It’s…it’s all very upsetting. I used to have order. Now…chaos.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the changes, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds as though your work environment is…challenging. Have you experienced any physical symptoms along with this stress?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Doctor, I'm 87 years old! What physical symptoms haven't I had? Aches, pains…the usual. I don't have time to catalogue every little twinge. It's the mental strain, you see? The sheer…incompetence of everyone around me. It keeps me up at night, worrying about the future of…well, everything. Is this going somewhere, Doctor? I have a luncheon scheduled.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Schlatterer. It is important to differentiate between the normal aches and pains of aging and those potentially exacerbated by stress. Let’s try a more focused approach. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep pattern beyond simply being kept awake?
PATIENT: Changes? Well…I wake up. Often. Several times a night. It’s hardly a revelation, Doctor. I’m not a young man. But it used to be…more restful. I’d wake up feeling…prepared. Now I wake up feeling…drained. And then I think about the new digital cataloging system they want to implement and…well, you can imagine. It's a catastrophe waiting to happen. Honestly, the whole thing is just…utterly ridiculous. Are we getting anywhere, or are we simply cataloging my grievances?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a clearer picture, Mr. Schlatterer. Frequent awakenings and feeling unrested can certainly be indicative of stress. Now, are you experiencing any difficulties with your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Look, I eat. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends on the day, doesn’t it? And frankly, it depends on the quality of the meal. My ex-wife always made dreadful food. That was another source of stress, come to think of it. It's all connected, you see. The incompetence, the chaos, the dreadful cooking…it’s a vicious cycle. Are we done yet? I really must be going. This is a complete waste of my time. I had a perfectly good afternoon planned. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, while I understand your…discomfort, I do feel it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to your symptoms. Perhaps we should proceed with a basic physical examination?
