DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I… well, it's about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for letting me know. That sounds very concerning. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: Um… my husband, he took me to the hospital a few months back because I was always feeling so tired. They did some tests, and… and they said it was cancer. I don’t remember what kind. He… he handled most of the talking with the doctors. He passed away last month, so… I’m a bit lost now.
DOCTOR: Oh, Chellsea, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. That is a tremendous amount to deal with, especially on top of everything else. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling lost right now. Please, take your time. Let's try to piece things together. Do you remember where at the hospital they told you about the cancer?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… in the big room. With the machines. I think it was the oncology department? He kept saying that word. It was a lot of people talking at once, and I… I mostly just remember being scared.
DOCTOR: Oncology… okay. That helps. And do you remember anything about where on your body the cancer was, or what tests they did?
PATIENT: They did… a lot of scans. Like, big machines that took pictures. And they… poked me a lot to get blood. He said it was in my… chest? Maybe lungs? I really don’t know. I mostly just laid there. It hurt sometimes when they poked me.
DOCTOR: Okay, scans and bloodwork, and they mentioned something about your chest and potentially your lungs. That gives us a starting point. Do you happen to have any paperwork from the hospital visit with you today?
PATIENT: I… I think so. He kept everything. It's in my bag, I believe. Just a moment. Here. I think this is it. It’s a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you. We'll take our time going through this. I want to get as much information as possible to understand what happened and what the next steps should be. Before we dive into the paperwork, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Well… I’m tired. A lot. Even after sleeping. And I’ve been… coughing. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. And sometimes it hurts to breathe. Just… a little ache in my chest. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, coughing, and some chest discomfort. Those symptoms definitely warrant further investigation. To help me get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I haven't been eating much. Just not hungry. And… sometimes I lose my balance. It doesn't happen often, but it's scary when it does. And… I've lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel… looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, occasional dizziness, and unintentional weight loss. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. That’s important information. Now, let’s take a look at this paperwork. Do you mind if I ask some questions as I review it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s alright. Ask whatever you need to know. I just want to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. It looks like here, from the hospital discharge summary, it says you were diagnosed with… Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. The report indicates it has metastasized – spread – to your bones. The initial scans show masses in both lungs and… some areas of concern in your spine and ribs. They started you on a chemotherapy regimen called… Cisplatin and Pemetrexed. Do you recall starting chemotherapy?
PATIENT: Chemotherapy… Yes… He helped me go. A lot of poking. And… I felt very sick afterwards. Tired and… and my stomach hurt. It was… awful. I only went a few times, I think. He stopped taking me because… because he got sick himself.
DOCTOR: I am so sorry to hear that, Chellsea. That sounds incredibly difficult, both dealing with the chemotherapy and everything else you were going through with your husband. It's understandable that it was overwhelming. So, it appears you completed a few cycles of Cisplatin and Pemetrexed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything. At least, not that I remember. He always asked me, and I always said no. He was very careful about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just… just some pills for the pain. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? I take them when my back hurts. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep. That’s all. He used to get them for me. I don't really know how much to take, so I just take a few.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for pain. It’s good you’re letting me know about that, even though it’s over-the-counter. It’s important to know everything you’re taking. Now, to get a better understanding of your current condition, I’d like to do a physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your lymph nodes, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s alright. Whatever you need to do. I just want to… know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could sit up on the table for me, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths for me when I ask. Okay, let's start with your lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Deep breath in… and out… I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds in both lower lobes, and some crackles. This is consistent with fluid accumulation or inflammation in the lungs. It’s not unexpected given the lung cancer, but we’ll need further imaging to assess the extent. I’m also feeling some slightly enlarged lymph nodes in your neck. Again, this is something we need to investigate further. Your reflexes are intact, and your strength is good, but I did notice some mild unsteadiness when you walked earlier, which is something we’ll want to monitor.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… bad. Is it bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Chellsea, it’s not good, you’re right. Stage IV lung cancer is a serious diagnosis. And the findings on the exam—the diminished breath sounds, enlarged lymph nodes, and some unsteadiness—are concerning. But it’s important to remember that everybody responds differently to treatment. We’re going to do everything we can to manage your symptoms, slow the progression of the cancer, and improve your quality of life. Right now, the first step is to get a clearer picture of where things stand. I want to order a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to see the extent of the cancer and if it has spread anywhere else. We’ll also need some blood work to assess your overall health and kidney function. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. That sounds… necessary. I just… I don't know what to do. My husband always handled everything. What… what if it’s too much? What if there’s nothing you can do?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared right now, Chellsea. It’s a huge loss to lose your husband, and then to be facing this on top of everything else… I want you to know that you’re not alone. We’ll work through this together. And I want to be honest with you: Stage IV lung cancer is often not curable. However, there are many treatments available that can help control the cancer, relieve your symptoms, and improve your quality of life—sometimes for months, even years. We have options like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. We’ll also focus on palliative care—managing your pain and other symptoms to make you as comfortable as possible. Before we start any treatment, we need to get the results of the CT scan and blood work. Once we have those results, we can discuss your options in more detail and come up with a plan that’s right for you. Would you like me to explain any of that in more detail?
PATIENT: Immunotherapy? And… targeted therapy? I don’t understand any of this. It just sounds… scary. I mostly just want to feel better. I want to be able to… breathe without hurting. Could we… could we just focus on the breathing for now? Is there anything you can do to help me breathe easier?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. Focusing on relieving your symptoms, especially your breathing, is our top priority right now. You are right to ask that. It’s important to address what’s bothering you most. There are several things we can do. First, I can prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. I'll also prescribe a short course of oral steroids to reduce inflammation in your lungs, which can also help with your breathing. Additionally, we can explore oxygen therapy if your oxygen levels are low. We’ll need to check your oxygen saturation levels to see if that’s appropriate for you. Regarding immunotherapy and targeted therapy, those are more advanced treatments that we can discuss in more detail after we get the results of the CT scan. They work by boosting your immune system or targeting specific cancer cells, but they're not right for everyone. We need to see what type of lung cancer you have and if you're a good candidate for those treatments. Does that sound like a good starting point?
PATIENT: Yes… inhalers and steroids sound okay. Not too scary. Thank you, Doctor. I just… I’m so tired of being scared. When will I get the CT scan? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Chellsea. I understand completely. It’s okay to be scared, and we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. I’m going to write an order for a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis right now. You can schedule it with the radiology department. They're usually pretty flexible with scheduling. I’ll have the receptionist give you a referral slip and the phone number for radiology. Typically, the results come back within 24-48 hours. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. Really. I guess I'll go schedule the scan then. And… I'll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And remember, you are not alone in this. We’ll face it together. The receptionist will give you the referral slip and the radiology number as you leave. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon. .
