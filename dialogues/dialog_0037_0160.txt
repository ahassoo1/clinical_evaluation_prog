DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this… tiredness. And this awful habit I’ve gotten back into. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t even want to talk about it, but my niece insisted. She worries too much. It’s just… I’ve been feeling so weak lately, and I’ve started eating dirt again. Yes, dirt. Like… from the garden. Don't look at me like that. It helps, okay? Though I know it can't be good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hardenburgh. Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to talk about things that are difficult, and I appreciate your honesty. You said you've been feeling weak and have returned to eating dirt. When did this tiredness start, and can you describe what you mean by "weak"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… let me think. It’s been… oh, a few months now, maybe three? It’s creeping up on me, you see. It's not like falling down weak, more like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting out of a chair. And I just can’t seem to shake it. I used to be able to do anything. Gardening, walking… now, I nap three times a day. It’s ridiculous. And the dirt… well, it feels… soothing, I guess? Like something's missing, and that fixes it, temporarily. Don't ask me why. I don't know. It happened when I was a little girl too, back in Ethiopia.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this has been going on for approximately three months, with the weakness being more of a significant effort to perform daily activities, and you’ve also noticed a resurgence of eating dirt, something you experienced as a child in Ethiopia. You mentioned it feels “soothing” and temporarily alleviates something. Can you tell me more about when you eat the dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s just… whenever I get really tired, really low. It doesn’t have to be physical tiredness, sometimes it’s just… a feeling. A hollow feeling. And I’ll find myself in the garden, digging around. I usually go for the red clay, if that makes any difference. Not the sandy stuff. Red clay. And… I try to wash it off afterwards, of course. Don't think I'm a complete savage. But it doesn’t always work. And I don't tell anyone, except my niece, and she just fusses. It’s a silly habit, really. A grown woman eating dirt. Honestly, I should just force myself to stop. It’s probably just a lack of… vitamins, or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the dirt-eating is associated with feelings of tiredness and a hollow feeling, and you specifically prefer red clay. You're also understandably concerned it might be related to a vitamin deficiency. Before we jump to conclusions about vitamin deficiencies, I’d like to get a more complete picture of your overall health. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not really. I had a bad case of the flu a few years back, but that's it. Nothing chronic, nothing serious. I used to go to a doctor regularly, but… honestly, what's the point? They just tell you to eat your vegetables and get more sleep. I’m seventy-nine years old. Things ache, I get tired, that's just… life. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, I don't even remember. Five years, maybe? More? I don’t take any medications, either. Never have. I prefer natural remedies, if I can. Though, this dirt-eating clearly isn’t a very good one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, haven't seen a doctor in approximately five years, and you prefer natural remedies. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been very lucky, I suppose. Never broken a bone, never needed stitches. Just… the normal aches and pains of getting older. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was back in Ethiopia, a very long time ago. They didn't have fancy hospitals like these back then, let me tell you. Mostly just a man with a knife and a lot of courage. Honestly, I prefer to avoid doctors and hospitals whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the tonsillectomy as a child. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had some sort of heart trouble later in life. But everyone in my family lived a long time, so… I don’t know. My father was very strong, very healthy until the very end. There wasn’t much talk of illness back then, if you understand. People just… dealt with things. We didn’t go to doctors, so we didn’t have diagnoses. Honestly, I doubt it matters much. Everyone's different.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of high blood pressure and heart trouble, but limited information due to limited access to medical care. Now, I'd like to ask about your current lifestyle. Can you tell me a little about your diet – what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables from my garden, when I have the energy to pick them. I like fish, if I can get it. I make a nice stew sometimes, with lentils and potatoes. But honestly, it's mostly simple things. Toast for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch… I don’t really have much of an appetite these days, to be honest. And I do enjoy a little sweet treat now and then, a biscuit with my tea. It's not very exciting, I assure you. And I suppose that's why I'm tired all the time! Not enough… something.
DOCTOR: Okay, a diet consisting of vegetables, fish, lentils, potatoes, and simple foods like toast and sandwiches, with a fondness for sweets. And a generally reduced appetite. Do you drink alcohol, or smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My mother always said it was the devil's brew, and I never questioned it. And smoking? Absolutely not. It's dreadful for you. I wouldn’t dream of it. I've always been very careful about my health, despite this… unfortunate habit. I suppose everyone has their vices.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol or smoking. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose so. I don't really like being poked and prodded, but… if it will help. Just please be quick about it. And don't expect miracles. I'm an old woman, after all. My body isn’t what it used to be. But alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We'll keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds… a bit faint. I hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower left quadrant. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. Okay, that’s all for the basic exam. I also want to check your hands and feet for any signs of… changes. I notice a little swelling in your ankles and your fingertips seem a bit pale. Now, I think it would be beneficial to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? This is dreadful. But alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I have no choice. What kind of tests? And will it hurt? And how long will it take? I don’t have all day, you know. Honestly, I just want to know why I’m so tired. And maybe find a way to stop this… dirt-eating. It’s really quite embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Ms. Hardenburgh. The tests are relatively quick and straightforward. We'll just need a small sample of your blood. It will sting for a moment when the needle goes in, but it's usually over very quickly. We'll check your complete blood count – that tells us about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. We'll also check your iron levels, vitamin D levels, and kidney function. This will help us rule out some common causes of fatigue and weakness. It should take about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood and send it to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. While we're waiting for the results, can you tell me a little bit more about when you eat the dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's just... when I feel really, really low. Not just physically tired, but… empty. Like something's missing inside me. It's hard to explain. It happens most often in the evenings, after I’ve been alone for a while. I'll be sitting in my chair, and this feeling will creep up on me. Then I’ll find myself wandering into the garden, almost without thinking. And there it is, the red clay. It's… soothing. It fills that empty feeling, just for a little while. It’s awful, I know. It's worse when I'm stressed, too. My niece is always fussing over me, trying to get me to eat better and exercise more. It just makes me feel worse, and then I end up in the garden. It’s a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's associated with feelings of emptiness, it tends to happen in the evenings when you're alone, and it's exacerbated by stress and your niece’s concern. It sounds like it provides a temporary sense of relief. This is unusual, Ms. Hardenburgh, and while I want to rule out any physical causes of your fatigue and weakness with the blood tests, I'm also concerned about the psychological aspect of this behavior. Sometimes, craving non-food items like dirt can be a sign of a nutrient deficiency, but it can also be related to stress, anxiety, or depression. I would like to get a referral for you to see a therapist, if you'd be open to that. They could help you explore these feelings and develop coping mechanisms. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A therapist? Oh, goodness no! What would I even tell a therapist? “I eat dirt when I feel sad?” They’d think I’m crazy! I’m an old woman, I just need a bit of rest and maybe a good biscuit. I don’t need someone poking around in my head. I've always been perfectly capable of dealing with my own feelings. It's just… this tiredness is new. And the dirt-eating is just a silly habit. A bad one, I admit, but… I don’t need a therapist. I just need to know why I’m so tired, and then maybe I can stop eating dirt. Just… run the tests. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. We'll start with the blood tests, as you requested. I'll write the order now and have the lab technician come in and draw the samples. It’s important to remember that I’m here to support you in any way I can, and if you change your mind about the therapy referral, please don’t hesitate to let me know. Just relax, and we'll get this done as quickly as possible. The lab technician will be right in. In the meantime, I want to briefly discuss your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, none. Never have. I prefer natural remedies, you know? Honey for a sore throat, chamomile tea for a good night’s sleep. And a good cup of tea always helps. I've always been very careful about what I put into my body. Except for… well, you know. But that's different. It’s not a medicine. It’s just… dirt. And I have no allergies. None. Just a dislike of fussing and unnecessary poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications and no allergies. That's good to know. It sounds like you're very mindful of your health, despite this unusual behavior. Alright, it looks like the lab technician is ready for you. They’ll come in and explain the process. Once the tests are done, we'll wait for the results, and then we'll discuss them and create a plan to address your fatigue and weakness. Is there anything I can do for you right now before the technician arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And try not to make a fuss, alright? I don't like being the center of attention. Honestly, this whole thing is rather embarrassing. I feel like a silly old woman. But I suppose I need to know why I'm so tired. That's all. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand. I'll make sure everything is as quick and discreet as possible. I'll step out of the room now and let the technician take care of you. Just relax, and they’ll explain everything. I’ll be right outside if you need anything.
