DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Sasha! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my leg. It's been swelling up, you see. After the... the treatments. For the cancer. It's just… puffy. And a little uncomfortable. I hope it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. Swelling in the leg after cancer treatments is something we definitely want to look into. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about the treatments you had?
PATIENT: Treatments… Oh dear. Let me think. It was… chemotherapy, I think. And radiation. Yes, radiation too. It was a long time ago now, maybe… five years? Six? It was at the big hospital in the city. They did lots of tests. And then… pills and the machine. That’s all I really remember, to be honest. It was… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, chemotherapy and radiation, about five or six years ago. That gives me a good starting point. And you said the swelling started after those treatments finished?
PATIENT: Yes, yes exactly! It wasn't right during the treatments, no. It started… slowly. Maybe a year or two after everything stopped. At first it was just a little bit bigger at the end of the day. But now… it’s more noticeable, all the time. Especially this warm weather doesn’t help, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling developed gradually, a year or two after your treatments ended, and it seems to be worse with the warmer weather. Is it just one leg that’s swollen, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. The right leg is perfectly fine. It’s… it’s mostly my calf, I think. And my ankle gets a bit puffy too. It doesn't hurt badly, it's just… heavy. And it's making it hard to find shoes that fit comfortably.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left leg, mostly in the calf and ankle. Heavy feeling, making it hard to find shoes. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your left leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes? Let me see… It feels… a bit thicker, maybe? And… sometimes it looks a little red. Not like a rash, but… not its normal color, you know? It’s hard to explain. I haven't really paid that much attention, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, thicker skin and sometimes a bit of redness. That’s helpful. Have you had any history of blood clots, Sasha?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I don’t remember the doctor ever saying anything about that. I had lots of tests, like I said, but… I don’t recall anyone mentioning blood clots. Sorry, I'm not very good at remembering things!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sasha. Don't worry about it at all. It's my job to figure things out. Okay, let's do a quick exam of your leg. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that’s fine. Please. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Sasha. I’m feeling some mild warmth in your left calf compared to your right, and there is some definite swelling. Your pulses feel good and strong, which is reassuring. It is tender to the touch in a few spots. And I can see some changes in the skin color, as you mentioned. It looks like there might be some mild pitting edema – that’s when pressing on the skin leaves a slight indentation for a little while. Based on what you’ve told me and this exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some lymphedema, which is swelling caused by a buildup of fluid due to damage to the lymphatic system. The chemotherapy and radiation can sometimes affect the lymph nodes and cause this. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot. Would you mind if we did a quick ultrasound of your leg just to be safe?
PATIENT: An ultrasound? Oh dear. Is that… unpleasant? I don’t like needles. And… I don’t want anything painful. What does it show? And what is… lymph-edema? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Sasha. Let's take things one step at a time. An ultrasound is completely painless – it doesn’t involve any needles at all! It uses sound waves to create a picture of the blood vessels in your leg, so we can see if there's a blood clot. It’s a very common and safe test. Lymphedema, as I mentioned, is swelling caused by a buildup of fluid when the lymphatic system isn’t working properly. The lymph nodes are part of your immune system and help drain fluid from your tissues. Sometimes, cancer treatment can damage them. It’s not usually an emergency, but it can cause discomfort and make it harder to move around. We can often manage it with compression stockings, elevation, and sometimes physical therapy. The important thing right now is to figure out exactly what's going on. The ultrasound will help us do that. Would you be comfortable with me ordering one for you?
PATIENT: Oh… no needles, that's good. And it sounds… manageable. Not terrible. Alright, yes. Yes, please order the ultrasound. I just want to get this sorted out. Will I have to lie down? And… how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Great, Sasha. I'm glad you’re comfortable with that. Yes, you will need to lie down for the ultrasound. It usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes. The technician will apply some gel to your leg and then move a small handheld device over your skin. It’s completely non-invasive. I’ll write the order now and then we can get you scheduled. The radiology department will call you to set up an appointment. In the meantime, try to elevate your left leg whenever you can and avoid standing for long periods. Do you have any questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: Elevate it… yes, I can do that. I sit a lot anyway. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing what might be going on. And that there isn't a… a terrible emergency.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. We’ll get the results of the ultrasound as soon as they’re available and then we can discuss the best course of action. Here’s a copy of the order for the ultrasound. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and try to rest your leg.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Goodbye.
