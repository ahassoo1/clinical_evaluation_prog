DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ellan. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My niece, she’s been telling me about it for a spell now, and frankly, I’m willing to give anything a try. It’s for… discomfort, you understand. One simply doesn’t enjoy aches and pains at my age, and the usual remedies aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Discomfort, you say. And the “usual remedies” aren’t sufficient. Hmm. Could you be a little more specific about this discomfort, Ellan?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… everywhere, really. My hips, mostly. And my back. And sometimes my knees. It’s just… old age, I suppose. But it keeps me from doing things. Gardening, mostly. I used to have a lovely garden. And it interferes with… social engagements. One simply can’t be expected to stand for long periods, you know. It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: “Everywhere” is… broad. And “inconvenient” doesn’t really give me much to work with. When did this discomfort begin?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it didn’t happen overnight, you understand. It was… gradual. Perhaps five, maybe ten years ago? It started with just a little stiffness after gardening, but now… well, it's more persistent. It’s hard to say precisely. One doesn’t keep a calendar of aches and pains, Doctor. Really. It’s just… been there. A constant companion, if you will.
DOCTOR: Five to ten years… a gradual onset. Alright. And you said it interferes with gardening and social engagements. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no discomfort and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate this discomfort typically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale? Really, Doctor? I’m not good with numbers. Let me see… the worst it gets, when I’ve been on my feet for too long… perhaps a seven? No, maybe an eight. It’s… debilitating then, truly. But most days? It’s… a four, perhaps? A constant, nagging four. Enough to make one think twice about things, you understand. Enough to discourage one from… enthusiasm.
DOCTOR: A seven to eight with activity, a constant four. And you’re requesting medical marijuana to alleviate this discomfort, is that correct?
PATIENT: Precisely. My niece, she says it helps her sleep, and… well, the pain. She’s quite specific about the strains, of course. I haven’t gotten to that part yet. But yes. Relief. That’s what I’m hoping for. One simply deserves a bit of comfort in one’s golden years, don’t you think? It's not as though I'm asking for the moon, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, Ellan, while I understand your desire for relief, I do have some concerns. Have you tried other methods for pain management before considering medical marijuana?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Plenty. The usual things. Over-the-counter remedies, of course. Ibuprofen, things like that. They used to work, but they seem to have… lost their potency. I tried a physiotherapist for a spell, but it was rather… undignified, frankly. And my general practitioner prescribed some stronger pills, but they made me… drowsy. Unacceptably so. One can’t simply fall asleep in the middle of a social engagement, Doctor. It’s quite improper. Frankly, I’m at my wit’s end.
DOCTOR: I see. Ibuprofen ineffective, physical therapy undesirable, stronger medications with unacceptable side effects. Alright. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had a touch of the bronchitis a few years back. Nothing serious. And my blood pressure, it runs a little high, but it’s well-managed. Mostly with diet, you understand. No salt, very little sugar. And, oh yes, I had my gallbladder removed, decades ago. But that’s hardly relevant now, is it? Otherwise, I’m quite… robust, for my age. Really. A little ache here and there, but nothing to write home about. Until this, of course.
DOCTOR: Bronchitis, hypertension managed with diet, cholecystectomy decades ago. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. A little bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? A few sniffles, a little sneezing… everyone gets that. Nothing to speak of. Really. My niece is very careful about what I eat, you understand. She’s quite health-conscious. So, no allergies to report. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Just a little something for my blood pressure, prescribed by my general practitioner, of course. A small pill, every morning. And… well, my niece gives me a multivitamin. She’s very insistent. And sometimes, a little fish oil for my… joints. But that's hardly a medication, is it? Just a little something to keep things… lubricated, if you will. Nothing else. Really. A very simple regimen.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at your hips and knees, if that's alright with you. It will just be a basic assessment.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Very well. As long as it’s not… too undignified, Doctor. I do try to maintain a certain… composure, you understand. But yes. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would. My hips aren't what they used to be. And please, no sudden movements. One doesn’t want to… pull anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is normal. Now, if you could just gently lower yourself onto the examination table, we’ll take a look at your hips and knees. I’ll need to observe your range of motion and palpate the joints.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Very well. It’s not as easy as it used to be, you understand. There we go. Do be gentle, Doctor. It’s a bit… precarious, getting up and down these days. And please, don’t expect too much range of motion. They’re… well, they’re old hips. That's what my niece says, anyway. "Old hips, Ellan," she says. "It's just age."
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm palpating both hips and knees now. I’m noting some crepitus – that’s a grinding sensation – with movement and mild tenderness when I press on certain areas. Range of motion is somewhat limited in both joints. This is consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint condition common with age. Is there any swelling or warmth in either joint?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Swelling? No, not that I’m aware of. Though sometimes… they feel a little… puffed up, after I’ve been on my feet too long. But I just assumed that was… fluid, you understand? Old age, again. But no actual swelling, Doctor. Not that I’ve noticed. And warmth? No. They don’t feel particularly warm. Just… achy. And stiff. Especially in the mornings. It’s quite… inconvenient, really. Makes it difficult to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. No overt swelling or warmth. Stiffness in the mornings, consistent with osteoarthritis. Now, Ellan, while I understand your frustration, and your desire to find relief, I have to be honest with you. Medical marijuana is not a first-line treatment for osteoarthritis. And, frankly, there are potential risks and side effects to consider. It can interact with other medications, and there are concerns about cognitive impairment, especially in older adults. I'm also concerned about your blood pressure being slightly elevated. It’s important to address that before considering any new medications.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Cognitive impairment? Really, Doctor? I assure you, my mind is perfectly sharp. I read the newspaper every day, you know. And I can still beat my niece at Scrabble. Most days, anyway. But… interactions with other medications? I’m only on a little pill for my blood pressure! And the blood pressure… well, my niece says it’s probably just stress. Stress from… everything, you understand? But if you think it’s serious, perhaps we should address that first. I wouldn’t want to… add to the complications. Still, I was hoping… it was a little disheartening, frankly, to hear that it wasn’t a… simple solution. My niece made it sound so… promising.
DOCTOR: Well, Ellan, it’s understandable that you're disappointed. And I appreciate your honesty. Your niece means well, I'm sure. But it's important to have realistic expectations. Let's focus on getting your blood pressure under control first. We can explore other options for managing your osteoarthritis, such as physical therapy, weight management – even if it's just a few pounds – and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, if you can tolerate them. We can also discuss a referral to a rheumatologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A rheumatologist? Really, Doctor? That sounds… complicated. Physical therapy, I suppose, I could try again. But it was rather… undignificant. And weight management… well, I'm not terribly overweight. A few extra pounds, perhaps. But nothing significant. The ibuprofen… I’ve already tried that, remember? Didn’t do much good. Still… perhaps if we addressed the blood pressure first, it might make a difference. My niece says stress is the root of all evil, you know. And if we could just… relax a little more… maybe things wouldn’t be so achy. All right. Let’s try the blood pressure first. And perhaps… a little less Scrabble with my niece. She’s a very competitive woman, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. That sounds like a reasonable plan. I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's important to take it as directed and monitor your blood pressure regularly. I'll also give you a handout with some tips on managing stress and lifestyle modifications that can help. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you're doing. If your symptoms don't improve, or if they worsen, we can discuss a referral to a rheumatologist. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chest pain? Really, Doctor? That sounds… alarming. No, I don’t think so. Just… the medication. Is it… complicated to take? And the stress… I suppose I should try to relax more. But it’s difficult when one has a competitive niece! No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. And perhaps… perhaps you could write down the medication instructions? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. The medication is relatively straightforward. It’s one pill, once a day, with breakfast. I'll write down the instructions, along with potential side effects, and give you a handout with tips on stress management. And don't worry about the stress – it's something many people struggle with. Here you are. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. We’ll schedule that follow-up appointment for a month from today. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t think so. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient. And… perhaps I’ll just take it easy with my niece for a while. Less Scrabble, more… gardening. If my hips allow, of course. Yes. I think that’s all. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. Take care of yourself, and please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Goodbye.
