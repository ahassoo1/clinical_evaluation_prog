DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, good to see you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been going on for… goodness, I don’t know exactly how long now. A couple of days, I think? They're just… persistent. And a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A couple of days of persistent hiccups, alright. That can be frustrating. And embarrassing, I completely understand! Let's see if we can figure out what's going on. First, can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Oh, they're… regular, I suppose. Not like, huge, booming ones. Just little ones, coming every few minutes or so. Sometimes they come in little groups of two or three, then stop for a bit. And they don’t hurt, exactly, but they are… annoying, you know? Like a little flutter in my chest. Is that helpful? I don't know what details are important.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mirriam, thank you. "Little flutters" is a good way to describe them. And knowing they come in groups is useful too. So, not painful, just irritating and happening sporadically, sometimes in clusters. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really been paying attention, to be honest. I mostly just notice them when they happen. I was drinking a cup of tea earlier, and I think one started right after, but… I drink tea all the time, so I doubt that’s it. I was a bit flustered this morning, trying to find my glasses, maybe that had something to do with it? I don't know. I’m not very good at remembering what was happening before they start.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially related to being a bit flustered, but not consistently linked to anything specific. No connection to eating or drinking, as far as you can tell. That's alright, it can be hard to pinpoint these things. Let’s talk a little bit more generally. Have you been feeling unwell in any other way?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel… pretty good, actually, for my age. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? My joints ache a bit in the mornings, but that’s just getting old, I suppose. Nothing new or different, certainly. I’ve been eating okay, sleeping alright… honestly, these hiccups are the biggest thing bothering me. It’s just… unsettling, having your body do something like this for no reason.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mirriam. It’s good to hear you’re generally feeling well, despite the hiccups. And you’re right, it is unsettling when something just starts happening without a clear reason. A little joint stiffness is common at your age, so that doesn’t sound related. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… well, years ago, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, but it was sorted out with some medication. I don’t take anything for it now. And I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was no big deal. Other than that… nothing major, I don’t think. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, all things considered. I had a bad fall a few years back and broke my wrist, but that's healed completely. Does that help? I'm trying to remember everything...
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mirriam. Thank you. So, history of high blood pressure managed in the past, gallbladder removal, and a broken wrist that’s healed. No current medications?
PATIENT: No, no current medications. Not a one. Just a little cream for my hands sometimes when they get dry, but that’s all. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I believe in letting my body do its own healing, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I've tried a few different medications when I've been sick, but nothing ever bothered me. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mirriam. No known allergies. Now, just to finish up with your history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother had diabetes, I think, later in life. And my father… he had something with his heart, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t remember the details very well. My brother is still alive, and he’s perfectly healthy as far as I know. But that’s about all I remember, to be honest. We weren’t a very close family, so we didn’t really talk about these things. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes in your mother and some heart condition in your father. Thank you for sharing that. Alright, Mirriam, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I don't mind at all. It's good to be thorough, you know. I'm always a bit nervous about doctors, but you seem very nice and reassuring. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mirriam. That’s very kind of you to say. It’s my job to make you feel comfortable. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or areas of discomfort that I can detect. Everything feels normal in there. Okay, Mirriam. Physically, everything appears normal. Given your history and the examination findings, these hiccups are likely benign, meaning they're not caused by a serious underlying condition.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear! “Benign” is a good word. So, you don’t think it’s anything to worry about? It’s just… annoying? I’ve been so worried it was something serious. I hate going to the doctor, you know, always imagining the worst. What do you think is causing them, then? Is there anything I can do to make them stop?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry completely, Mirriam. It's always best to rule out anything serious, and in your case, that seems unlikely. Hiccups are often idiopathic, meaning we don't know the exact cause. They can be triggered by various things – eating too quickly, drinking carbonated beverages, stress, or even a sudden change in temperature. Sometimes, they just happen. There are a few things you can try at home to help relieve them. Have you tried holding your breath?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I’ve tried holding my breath! Several times. It sometimes works for a little while, then they come right back. I also tried drinking a glass of water upside down, like my grandmother used to do. That didn’t do a thing. And I tried getting someone to scare me, but that just made me jump! Honestly, I feel like I’ve tried everything. Is there a medication for hiccups? Or something else a doctor can do? I’m willing to try anything at this point, really. These little flutters are driving me mad!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mirriam. You’ve certainly tried a lot of the common remedies! Holding your breath and drinking water upside down are good first steps. There are medications that can sometimes help with persistent hiccups, but we usually reserve those for cases that are truly debilitating and haven't responded to other measures. Since your hiccups are annoying but not significantly impacting your daily life, I wouldn’t recommend starting medication just yet. What I'd like to do is recommend a bit of a "wait and see" approach. Continue to try the home remedies. If they continue for more than a week or start to interfere with your sleep or eating, then we can discuss medication options. In the meantime, try to relax and avoid stressful situations as much as possible. Sometimes, simply focusing on your breathing can help calm the diaphragm and stop the hiccups. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A “wait and see” approach is fine. I suppose they haven't been completely unbearable, just… persistent. And I do get a bit flustered easily, so maybe the stress is contributing to it. I’ll try to take it easy and focus on my breathing, like you said. Thank you for listening to me, and for not thinking I was silly for worrying about hiccups! You’ve put my mind at ease, and that’s a big relief. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Or any warning signs I should look out for? I don't want to ignore something serious if it does happen.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Mirriam! It's always better to be cautious and get things checked out, and I’m happy I could put your mind at ease. As for warning signs, those are rare, but it's good to be aware. If you experience any of the following, please contact me immediately: Severe chest pain Shortness of breath Difficulty swallowing Vomiting blood Fever These symptoms could indicate a more serious underlying condition. But again, these are unlikely in your case. Otherwise, just continue to monitor your symptoms, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I’m glad I could help. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind, and I really appreciate your patience. I'll try to relax and focus on my breathing, and I'll be sure to contact you if anything changes. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a good day.
