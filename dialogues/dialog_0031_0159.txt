DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Good to meet you too. Uh, well, it's kinda weird, honestly. I've been havin' trouble… gettin' out of chairs. Like, I sit down, and then it's just… hard to push myself up. Not always, but enough that it's worryin' me.
DOCTOR: I see. That is concerning, and it's good you're addressing it. So, you're experiencing difficulty rising from a seated position. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. It’s not pain, not really. More like… my legs just feel stuck, or heavy, I guess? It's been goin' on for maybe a month now, slowly gettin' worse. Like at first it was just after a long shift, but now it happens even after just sittin' for a bit. It doesn't matter what chair, really. Kitchen chair, my truck seat… doesn’t seem to make a difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a progressive weakness, starting after prolonged sitting and now occurring with shorter periods of rest. And it’s not accompanied by pain, but rather a feeling of heaviness or being “stuck.” Do you find you have any difficulty with other movements, such as walking, climbing stairs, or getting up from the floor?
PATIENT: No, not really. Walkin' is fine, stairs are fine. I gotta be careful sometimes, workin' in the oil fields, you know, climbin' on stuff, but that's just… bein' careful, not 'cause my legs can't do it. And gettin' up from the floor… I don't do that a whole lot, but when I do, it's no different than it used to be. Just gotta use my arms, like always. It’s only when I’m already sittin' in a chair. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things significantly. It seems to be isolated to the transition from a seated position. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this—any muscle aches, fatigue, changes in your appetite, or any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No muscle aches, no. I'm usually pretty tired after work, but that's just the work, you know? Appetite's been normal, I think. And no numbness or tingling, thankfully. I did notice… a couple of times, when I’m really tryin’ to get up, my legs kinda… shake a little? But it doesn’t happen every time. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent shaking during the effort to rise from a seated position. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but that healed up fine. And… well, my wife, she passed away a couple years ago. But besides that, I've always been pretty healthy. Never been much for doctors, honestly. Just kinda tough it out, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It takes courage to seek medical attention, and I appreciate you coming in today. So, no chronic medical conditions, and the broken arm was the only significant injury?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's about it. Just the arm as a kid. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothin'. I don't smoke, don't drink much, maybe a beer with the guys sometimes. And I eat pretty regular, mostly just… normal food. I try to get enough protein, you know, for work. It's kinda physical, the job.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the broken arm when you were a child?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital since I was a little kid. No surgeries either. I've been lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from work. Nothing serious enough for a doctor, usually. I'd patch myself up and get back to it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mom and dad both passed away a few years back. And I don't really have any siblings. They lived back in Mexico, mostly. I haven't seen them in a long time. As far as I know, they didn't have any… weird medical problems, if that makes sense? They just kinda… got old. My mom had high blood pressure, I think, but nothin' major. I don’t really know much about their medical histories, to be honest. We weren’t super close.
DOCTOR: I understand. That gives us a limited family history, but that’s alright. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I don't really like takin' pills if I can avoid it. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be safe, but that's about it. And I haven't been takin' it lately, to be honest. Been kinda busy with work and… other things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a problem with bee stings or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. It's kinda weird, huh? All this stuff I don't have. Usually when you go to the doctor, you have a whole list of problems, but I just can't seem to find any. It's just this chair thing.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it’s unusual to have such a clean medical history. It’s good that you’ve been generally healthy. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Doc. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully, it's nothin' serious. It's just… kinda worryin', you know? Especially bein' out there on the rigs. Gotta be able to get around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns, and we'll work through this together. First, could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm sittin'. It wasn't too bad gettin' up here, but I'll be honest, I'm already kinda thinkin' about how hard it's gonna be to get off of it. It's a weird feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to check your strength in your legs. Could you please cross your legs at the ankles?
PATIENT: Okay, crossed 'em. Feels… okay. Not painful, just… a little awkward, maybe? I don't usually sit still for very long, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, please try to resist as I push down on your knees. Just push back against my hand as hard as you can. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally, meaning good strength in both legs. Now, could you please straighten your legs out in front of you, keeping them straight?
PATIENT: Okay, legs are straight. Feels… a little tight, maybe? Not really painful, just… not as loose as they used to be, I guess? I don't usually sit with 'em straight like this, either. Mostly I’m crouched down workin’.
DOCTOR: Range of motion is full bilaterally, but with some subjective tightness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical, which is normal. Now, let's try standing up. Please stand up slowly, and tell me if you notice any difficulty or pain.
PATIENT: Whoa. Yeah, that was… harder than it should be. Felt kinda shaky, and I definitely had to use my arms more than I usually do. Not painful, but… definitely not easy. It’s like my legs just… didn’t wanna cooperate.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that. That was very helpful. And I appreciate you being honest with me. No tenderness noted upon palpation. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing proximal weakness, meaning weakness in the muscles closer to the center of your body. There are several possibilities, ranging from a simple vitamin deficiency to something more complex. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. Specifically, I want to check your vitamin D levels, potassium, magnesium, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. Blood work sounds… sensible. I don't really know much about vitamins and stuff, but if it can figure out what's goin' on, then I’m all for it. Just… tell me where to go and what I need to do. Hopefully, it's nothin' too serious. I gotta get back to work, you know? Can't be down for too long.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I’m going to print out a lab requisition for you. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. You don’t need an appointment. Just take this form with you, and they’ll take care of the rest. It’s a standard blood draw, so it shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as significant pain, numbness, or difficulty walking—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, got it. Down the hall, to the left. No appointment needed. Sounds easy enough. No, I don't think so. Just… try not to overdo it, I guess? Is that right? Take it easy until we know what's goin' on? And if things get worse, call the office. I think that covers it. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you listenin' to me. It's kinda good to finally have somebody lookin' into this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. You're right – try to avoid strenuous activity until we get the results back. And please don't hesitate to call if anything changes. It was my pleasure meeting you. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
