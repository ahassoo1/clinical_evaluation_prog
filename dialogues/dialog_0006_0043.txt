DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel, good to see you. Or... good to meet you. Time gets away from me these days, you know?
PATIENT: Heh, that it does, Doctor. That it does. Good to meet you too. I don’t think I’ve been to a new doctor in… well, a long time. This headache’s been botherin’ me, that’s why I finally made the appointment. It's right in the back of my head, mostly.
DOCTOR: Headache, alright. And how long has this headache been bothering you, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… oh, about three weeks ago, I reckon. Not every day at first. Just… now and then. But the last few days, it’s been pretty constant. Feels like a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain, you know? More like… pressure.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, constant for the last few days… dull ache, pressure. Anythin’ make it worse?
PATIENT: Well now… that’s a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it. Let me see… bright lights seem to bother it a little. And if I get really stressed, definitely. My daughter’s been havin’ some trouble, and that’s been weighin’ on my mind a lot. But other than that… not really sure. Does bending over make it worse? I haven't tried that specifically.
DOCTOR: Bright lights and stress… okay. And no, bending over isn't something you've noticed affecting it. Alright. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think again. I’ve been a little tired lately, but I’m 84, Doctor! So, that’s not necessarily new. My vision’s been a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, and they’re probably just dirty. Oh! And I've felt a little dizzy a couple of times, but just for a second. Nothing that made me fall or anything. Does that make sense? I’m ramblin’ now, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, blurry vision, occasional dizziness… alright, that's good to know. You're not ramblin’, Mr. Gibbel. We need all the information we can get. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this headache?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely not. And no nausea or vomitin’ either. Thankfully. I haven’t had a stomach bug in… well, I can’t even remember when. So, no, none of that. Just this headache and feelin’ a bit old, which, again, is pretty normal for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with medication. Stopped takin’ it a few years back, and he said I was doin’ okay. And I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t bother me too much. Oh, and I had a gallbladder removed… goodness, must be thirty years ago now. Does that cover it? I probably forget somethin’.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis, gallbladder removal… alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve taken a lot of different things over the years, and never had a reaction. Penicillin, I think, when I was a kid, but that was so long ago, I barely remember it. I don’t really take much medication these days. Just some vitamins.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, vitamins only… alright. Now, before we do a quick exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now. My mother, she had… well, she had some heart trouble. And my father, he just… got old, I guess. He didn’t have much energy towards the end. I’ve got a sister, but we haven’t seen each other in years. She lives out West somewhere. I don’t really know much about her health. I don't think there's much heart trouble in the family besides my mother, though. Is that what you're askin' about?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Now, just a couple more questions, then we'll do a quick exam. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no, I don't smoke. Never have. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn’t care for it. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, it must be fifty years now. Gave it up when I got married, and just never went back. Not much of a drinker, never was.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. That’s very good to know. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to just do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I’m a pretty easy patient. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just sit up here for me. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… okay. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not terrible. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can do that. Like this? Is that good? I used to have pretty good eyes when I was younger, but they’ve gotten a little blurry now, as I said. Just let me know if I'm not followin’ it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. A little slow, but alright. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that too strong? I used to work with my hands a lot, so they're still pretty strong, I guess.
DOCTOR: No, that's good. Very good, actually. Now, just stand up for me, if you can. Good. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Just a bit wobbly, sometimes. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know? Is that alright? Should I walk faster?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. Just walk at your own pace. Alright, Mr. Gibbel, that’s enough for now. Everything seems… fairly normal, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your gait is a bit unsteady. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like a tension headache, likely exacerbated by stress and maybe a little dehydration. But with your age and the persistent nature of the headache, I want to be cautious. I'd like to order a few blood tests, just to rule out anything serious. And maybe a CT scan of your head, just for peace of mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh my. That sounds… serious. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust you. Blood tests, sure, no problem. A scan… well, I hope it doesn’t show anything bad. What exactly are you lookin’ for with the scan? Just tryin’ to understand. And is this gonna be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gibbel. A CT scan is just a precaution. We’re looking to rule out any structural problems, like a bleed or a tumor, but it’s very unlikely that’s what this is. It’s mostly just to be thorough. As for the cost, I’m not sure of the exact amount, but our billing department can work with you on a payment plan, and we can see if you qualify for any financial assistance programs. Don’t worry about that right now. Let's focus on getting the tests done. I'll write you a requisition for the blood tests, and a referral for the CT scan. The lab is just down the hall, and the scan can be scheduled at the imaging center across the street. I'll also prescribe you a mild pain reliever for the headache, and recommend you drink plenty of water. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. A payment plan would be a big help, thank you. And the pain reliever, that would be good. I’ll try to drink more water, too. So, blood tests and a scan, then a follow-up appointment. I guess that’s all I can do, then. Thank you, Doctor. You seem like a very thorough doctor, and I appreciate that. I hope the results are nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could help. And don’t worry, we’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll have the nurse print out the requisitions and referral for you, and she can answer any questions you have about scheduling the tests. I'll see you next week. And please, if your headache gets significantly worse, or you experience any new symptoms like fever, weakness, or vision changes, come to the emergency room immediately. Have a good day, Mr. Gibbel.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will.
