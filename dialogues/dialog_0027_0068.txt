DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it’s my leg. It's been swelling up. It started after… after the treatments, you see. For the… for the bad stuff. It's just… puffy. And a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Puffy, you say. And uncomfortable. Okay. And these "treatments"... were those for a specific condition?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. It was… cancer. Breast cancer. I had… chemotherapy, and then… radiation. A long time ago now, though. Maybe… five years? I don't remember exactly. It’s the swelling that’s new. It’s mostly in my right leg.
DOCTOR: Five years ago... alright. And just to be clear, the swelling started after the cancer treatments ended?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. It wasn't like this during… during everything. It was good for a while, and then… a few months back, it started. Just a little at first, and now it's… more noticeable, you know? It’s hard to get my shoe on sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling developed a few months ago, and is now causing some difficulty with your shoe. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I think. Some days it's better, when I… when I put my leg up. But if I walk too much, or stand for a long time, it gets worse. Definitely worse. It doesn’t… hurt, really. Just feels… heavy. And puffy. Like a balloon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any redness, warmth, or pain in your leg along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no redness. And it’s not warm, not really. Just… swollen. And like I said, no pain. It’s just… uncomfortable. It's not a sharp pain, it’s more like… a heavy feeling. I just want it to go away, you know? It’s… annoying. Do you think it’s the cancer coming back?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Queener. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. It's unlikely to be the cancer itself returning at this point, but we need to investigate. Let's do a quick physical exam of your leg, and I'll take a look at your medical records. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. A quick exam is fine. I just… I worry. It's probably nothing, right? But better to be safe. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Queener. We'll check things out thoroughly. First, I’m going to measure the circumference of both your legs, just to see if there’s a difference in size. Then I’ll feel for any tenderness, and check your pulses. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… no, not really. Just… old age! No diabetes, no heart problems. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, but that’s it. And… sometimes for my arthritis in my hands, but that doesn’t bother me much today. Is measuring my legs going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt at all, Ms. Queener. It's just like taking a measurement with a tape measure. Okay, your left leg measures 38 centimeters. And your right leg… 42 centimeters. There’s a noticeable difference in size. Now, let me check your pulses… Your pulses are present and feel normal. No tenderness to the touch either.
PATIENT: Okay… 42 centimeters. That is bigger, isn't it? I knew it was swollen, but… 4 centimeters? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: It does indicate some fluid buildup, Ms. Queener. A 4-centimeter difference is significant enough for us to investigate further. It's likely lymphedema, which is swelling caused by a blockage in the lymphatic system. It can sometimes happen after cancer treatment, especially after removing lymph nodes. It’s not necessarily bad, but it’s something we need to manage. To confirm, I'd like to order a lower extremity ultrasound. That will help us visualize the blood flow and rule out any other causes of the swelling, like a blood clot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An… ultrasound? Oh dear. Is that… expensive? I only have Medicare, you know. And what's… lymph-e-de-ma? Is that serious? I just want it to go away. I don't want any more… tests if I don't need them. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Queener. Medicare should cover the ultrasound, but we can definitely check with billing to confirm beforehand. And lymph-e-de-ma, as I mentioned, is swelling due to a buildup of fluid. It's often manageable with things like compression stockings and physical therapy. It’s not immediately life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to skin problems. The ultrasound will help us determine the best course of action. We do want to rule out a blood clot, just to be safe. Is that okay?
