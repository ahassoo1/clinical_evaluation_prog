DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been having some…well, pressure on my bladder. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Pressure on your bladder, alright. And when you say “a little while,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started, I believe, around the middle of June. So, about six weeks, maybe a little more. It’s not constant, but it happens several times a day. It just feels…full, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, several times a day…and you say it feels full even after voiding. I see. Are you experiencing any pain with urination, or any burning sensation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No pain at all, and no burning. It’s purely the feeling of pressure and…incomplete emptying, I suppose. Like I haven’t quite gotten everything out, even though I think I have.
DOCTOR: No pain, no burning, just the sensation of incomplete emptying. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything unusual like blood?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. The color seems normal, and the smell is…well, the usual. I always try to drink plenty of water, so it’s usually pretty clear. I haven’t seen any blood, thankfully. I do notice I’m going to the bathroom a bit more often than I used to, but I wasn’t sure if that was related to the pressure.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency along with the pressure and incomplete emptying… We’ll need to explore this further. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills, and thankfully no lower back pain. I have been a little more tired lately, but I thought that was just with the summer heat. It’s been quite warm, hasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And to get a more complete picture, let's go over some general medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, if that’s helpful?
DOCTOR: Hypertension, well-controlled… good. And what medication are you currently taking for that, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: I’m taking Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. I’ve been on it for about four years now, and my blood pressure readings are consistently good. My primary care physician monitors it regularly. I also take a daily multivitamin, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg, multivitamin…Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. No reactions to any medications, no food sensitivities… nothing like that. My husband always jokes I’ll eat anything!
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve been very fortunate, thankfully. Nothing major, nothing minor. I’ve always avoided surgery if possible.
DOCTOR: No surgeries… Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of bladder issues, kidney problems, or urinary tract infections in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My mother had frequent UTIs when she was younger, but that was many years ago, and she doesn’t have them anymore. My father had some kidney stones, but again, that was a long time ago and he recovered fully. No one else that I’m aware of has had any bladder problems. My grandmother on my mother’s side did have some…incontinence when she was very old, but that was due to general weakness, I think.
DOCTOR: History of UTIs in mother, kidney stones in father, incontinence in grandmother…Now, regarding your social history, Ms. Creagh, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week, but I don’t drink heavily. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I try to live a healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to complete the picture, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. That will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief pelvic exam. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table, we’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. Just tell me if there’s anything specific you’re listening for.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Creagh. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t detect any masses or tenderness. Normal bowel sounds present in all quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your lower abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain. No pain with palpation, but I do note a slight fullness in your bladder. I’m now going to perform a quick pelvic exam. I’ll explain each step as I go, and please feel free to let me know if you’re uncomfortable at any point.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Please do. And thank you for explaining everything. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: External genitalia appear normal. Now, I’m going to insert a speculum. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Visual inspection of the cervix is normal. No signs of inflammation or lesions. I’m now going to collect a urine sample to check for infection. Okay, that’s all done. Now, I will palpate your pelvic organs bimanually. Uterus is normal size and position. Ovaries are normal. No adnexal masses or tenderness detected. Alright, Ms. Creagh. Everything appears normal on physical exam. However, given your symptoms and the fullness I detected in your bladder, I'd like to send the urine sample for a comprehensive urinalysis and culture to rule out any underlying infection. I will also order a post-void residual volume test to determine how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Which is good. I appreciate you being so careful. The post-void residual volume test… is that uncomfortable? And when will I know the results?
DOCTOR: The post-void residual volume test involves a simple ultrasound scan after you urinate to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It’s completely non-invasive and shouldn’t cause any discomfort. The technician will simply place a probe on your abdomen. As for the results, I expect them back within 24 to 48 hours. We can discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and continuing to monitor your symptoms. I'm also going to write you a referral for a urogynecologist. While the initial workup seems normal, a specialist may be able to offer further evaluation and treatment options if your symptoms persist. Here are the orders for the tests and the referral. The lab is just down the hall, and the referral information includes contact details for the urogynecologist’s office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. A urogynecologist… that makes sense. I’m glad you’re being so proactive. I think I understand everything, but… what exactly would they do if the tests don’t show anything? What other possibilities are there?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Ms. Creagh. If the tests are negative – meaning no infection and a normal post-void residual volume – it suggests a functional problem rather than a structural one. Possibilities include overactive bladder, pelvic floor dysfunction, or even functional voiding disorder. These conditions often require specialized therapies like pelvic floor exercises, bladder retraining, or, in some cases, neuromodulation. The urogynecologist will be able to perform more detailed assessments – urodynamic testing, for example – to determine the underlying cause and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. It's also important to rule out any psychological factors that might be contributing to your symptoms, although we don't have any indication of that at this time. I want to assure you that there are many effective treatments available, even for these more complex conditions. The urogynecologist is the best person to guide you through the process. Do you have any further concerns or questions at this point?
PATIENT: That… makes me feel a little better, honestly. Knowing there are other possibilities, and things that can be done. It wasn’t so much the tests showing something wrong, as it was… feeling like I was going crazy, maybe. No, I think that answers everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so thoroughly, and for taking the time to listen. I really appreciate it. I'll go get the tests done now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you’re experiencing unexplained symptoms. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns after you receive the test results. We're here to support you. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will. Have a good day.
