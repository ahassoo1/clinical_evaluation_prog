DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I need it for an upcoming trip. Is that something you can help with?
DOCTOR: Hmm, a letter for fitness to fly… yes, I can certainly look into that for you. It depends on why you need the confirmation, though. Is this related to a pre-existing medical condition, or is it just a general check-up for travel insurance purposes?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… well, it’s not a condition, exactly. My husband passed away a few months ago, and we had a trip planned. I’m still going, to honor him, but the airline is being… strict about needing a doctor’s note, just to be sure I’m okay to travel given the recent… circumstances. It's more emotional, I suppose, than physical.
DOCTOR: I understand, Kiante. That sounds incredibly difficult, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s perfectly reasonable for the airline to request documentation in these circumstances. We want to ensure your travel is as safe and comfortable as possible, both physically and emotionally. So, let's just go through a quick assessment to make sure everything is alright. I'll want to ask you a few questions about your general health, and maybe do a brief physical exam, just to be thorough. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I want to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if that’s alright. The sooner I can get the letter, the sooner I can… well, the sooner I can go.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll move as efficiently as we can. Let’s start with a little bit about your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly over the past few years?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I usually go for an annual check-up. And… I had a pretty bad bout of the flu last winter, but otherwise I’ve been quite healthy. No major illnesses or surgeries. I have Medicare, so the records should all be there.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Medicare records are usually quite comprehensive. Let me pull those up now… Okay, I see your annual check-ups are consistent, and I see the influenza diagnosis from last winter. Anything else come to mind?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I mean, nothing significant. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but it healed completely. Oh, and I take a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Is that something you need to know? I really just need this letter.
DOCTOR: The multivitamin is good to know, thank you. It’s helpful for me to have a complete picture. And don’t worry, we will get to the letter. I just like to cover all the bases. Now, a few quick questions, if you don't mind. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all. Food, medication… nothing. I’ve always been lucky that way. I could eat anything, which is probably why I’m a bit… rounder than I used to be, but that’s another story.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s certainly a benefit! Alright, good. No allergies to worry about. Now, sometimes significant life events, like the one you’ve experienced, can affect sleep or appetite. Have you noticed any changes in either of those areas since your husband passed away?
PATIENT: It’s… been hard. I sleep, but it’s not restful. Lots of dreams. And my appetite… comes and goes. Some days I can barely eat, other days I just… eat whatever’s there. I’ve lost a few pounds, but nothing drastic. I'm trying to eat regularly, for the sake of… well, for the sake of something.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Kiante. Grief manifests in many ways, and changes in sleep and appetite are very common. It’s good that you’re trying to maintain some regularity with your eating, though. Just a few more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any feelings of excessive sadness, hopelessness, or difficulty concentrating lately?
PATIENT: Yes. All of it, really. Sadness, definitely. Hopelessness… some days it feels like that’s all there is. And concentrating… forget about it. I try to read, to distract myself, but I just… can’t focus. My mind wanders. It's like… a fog.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Kiante. That's very helpful. It sounds like you're experiencing some symptoms consistent with grief, which is a perfectly normal reaction to a significant loss. Now, I'd like to do a very brief physical exam just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The sooner this is all done, the better. I just… I need to get this letter and go.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get through this quickly. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That’s within a normal range. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Ears look clear as well, and your throat is… slightly red, but nothing concerning. Overall, physically, you seem to be doing alright. The slight redness in your throat could be from a mild cold, but it doesn’t seem to be anything serious. Now, just a quick neurological check... Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes. I can see it.
DOCTOR: Good, good. And can you squeeze my hands, nice and firm?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength in both hands. Alright, and lastly, just stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I’m a little wobbly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. A little unsteady, but nothing too concerning. It could just be from the stress and emotional fatigue. Alright, Kiante. Based on our conversation and the brief physical exam, it seems you’re physically stable enough to travel. However, your emotional state is understandably fragile, and traveling alone, soon after such a loss, could be difficult.
PATIENT: I know it's fragile. But I need to go. It was his dream trip. And… I promised him. I just need the letter. I’ll be careful. I promise.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's important to honor his memory, and fulfill promises. And I respect your determination. Alright, I will write you a letter stating that you are medically cleared to travel. However, I am going to include a few recommendations. I'm going to recommend you travel with a companion if at all possible. And I will also recommend that you have a plan in place for managing your grief while you're away – perhaps connecting with a support group or having a friend or family member you can call regularly. Would you like me to also include a list of resources for grief support in the area you're traveling to?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. Thank you. I… I think I can manage. I just need to get there. And I really appreciate you understanding.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. This letter confirms you are medically cleared for air travel, and includes those recommendations and resources. Please read it over carefully. I also want to encourage you to be kind to yourself, Kiante. Grief has no timeline. And if you find things become overwhelming while you're traveling, don't hesitate to seek help. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. This is… perfect. Thank you, Dr. Smetak. You’ve been very kind. And I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Please, take care of yourself, and safe travels. If you happen to be in the area again, and need anything, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good day, and try to find a little peace. .
PATIENT: .
