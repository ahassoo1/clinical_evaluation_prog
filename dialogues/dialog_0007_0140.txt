DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. It’s a problem in my mouth. A white coating. It’s rather… unsightly. I suppose you’ve seen it before. I haven’t much time, Doctor, so if we could be quick, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed at all, Antoine – it's my job to help, and these things happen. And I'll certainly try to be as efficient as possible. So, a white coating in your mouth. Has this been happening long?
PATIENT: Perhaps a week, maybe a little longer. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… there. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a very keen eye for these things. I assumed it was just… something I ate. But it hasn’t gone away. And frankly, I don’t have time for… mouth problems. I’m a faller, Doctor. I need to be at work.
DOCTOR: A week or so, not painful… okay. And you’re a “faller”?
PATIENT: Yes. A faller. As in, I fell trees. For a living. It’s… physical work. Requires a certain… robustness. Do you need a detailed explanation of my profession, Doctor? It seems rather irrelevant to a coating in my mouth.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. I just wanted to get a sense of your overall health, given the demands of your job. It can sometimes give clues. Okay, so the coating… is it all over your mouth, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly on the tongue, I believe. And perhaps the inside of the cheeks. It’s… difficult to say precisely. I don’t spend much time examining my mouth, frankly. I have more pressing matters to attend to. It's not causing any trouble, and I'd like to get this sorted quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the tongue and inner cheeks. And no other symptoms – no pain, no difficulty eating, no fever or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Just the unsightly coating. My wife made me come. She insists I get everything checked. Honestly, I think it's perfectly fine and she's overreacting, but here I am. Is it… contagious? That would be a problem. I work with others, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms, and you’re concerned about contagiousness given your work. That’s good to know. Let's just take a quick look, okay?
PATIENT: Must you? I assure you, it's nothing dramatic. It's just a… film. But if you insist. Be quick, please. I have trees to fell.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. It does look like a coating. It doesn’t appear to be anything acutely concerning, but it's good you came in to get it checked. It could be a few things, Antoine. One possibility is something called oral thrush – a yeast infection in the mouth. It's not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Another possibility is something a bit simpler, like a reaction to something you’ve been eating or drinking. Do you use any sort of mouthwash, or have you changed anything in your oral hygiene routine recently?
PATIENT: Mouthwash? No. I rinse my mouth with water, naturally. As for routine… no, nothing has changed. I’ve always done things the same way. And I assure you, my hygiene is perfectly adequate. I am a practical man, Doctor, not one for… fads. It's probably just… something I ate. Perhaps a bad apple. Or something. Honestly, I think your time would be better spent with patients who have real problems.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. And you're right, it could very well be something simple. However, given you haven't noticed any changes in your routine and it hasn’t resolved on its own, it's worth exploring a little further just to be sure. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to do a quick swab of the coating. It's a very simple test, doesn't hurt a bit, and we can send it to the lab for analysis. It will take a few days to get the results back. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A swab? More waiting? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming ridiculous. I have work to do. Trees don’t fell themselves, you know. Is this absolutely necessary? I haven’t got days to spare waiting for… analysis. Can’t you just… prescribe something? An antiseptic, perhaps? Something to get rid of it quickly? My wife will be furious if I return empty-handed, but this is becoming a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Antoine. And I wish we could just wave a magic wand and make it go away. But I want to make sure we're treating the right thing. Prescribing something without knowing the cause could actually make things worse, or mask a more serious problem. Given your work and your concerns about time, here's what I propose. We can do the swab, and while we’re waiting for the results, I'll recommend a simple over-the-counter antifungal mouthwash. It’s gentle, and if it is thrush, it might start to clear things up. If it doesn’t improve within a few days, then we'll get the lab results back and proceed from there. How does that sound?
PATIENT: An over-the-counter mouthwash. Fine. As long as it doesn’t require a lengthy visit to a pharmacy and doesn’t interfere with my work. And if it doesn't work, I expect prompt attention. I’m a busy man, Doctor. Don’t waste my time. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have trees to fell. Just tell me what to do, and let's be finished with this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. I understand. Here’s a printout with the name of the mouthwash and instructions for use. Use it twice a day after brushing your teeth for about a week. If you don’t see any improvement after 5-7 days, please call the clinic and we’ll get the lab results back and discuss the next steps. I’m also going to write you a note for your wife, just to reassure her that we’re taking this seriously and have a plan in place. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… a note for my wife, you say? Very well. As long as it keeps her quiet. This has been… an experience. Thank you, Doctor. Though I remain unconvinced of its necessity. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright. You're very welcome, Antoine. Get well soon, and be careful out there. If anything changes, or if you have any concerns at all, don't hesitate to call. .
