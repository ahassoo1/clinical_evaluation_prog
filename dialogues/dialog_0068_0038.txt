DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure I can explain it perfectly. It has to do with… planning, I suppose. A friend suggested I look into something… an Advance Directive, or a POLST form, she called it. Something to do with… what happens if I can’t speak for myself. It’s a bit hazy, to be frank. I’m divorced, and… well, I don’t have family close by, so I thought it best to get something in order.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite sensible. Advance care planning… important work. It sounds like your friend gave you some good advice. So, you're interested in discussing a POLST form, or perhaps a living will?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A living will… a POLST form… they sound so similar. She just said something about making sure my wishes are known. I… I don’t really know the difference, Doctor. Perhaps you could explain it simply? Which one would be more… appropriate for someone in my situation? I’m… not very good with these sorts of things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Of course, no need to apologize. It is confusing. A living will, generally, outlines your wishes for care in more general terms… if you were to become incapacitated, things like life support, that sort of thing. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific… it’s a medical order based on your current health, and it tells healthcare providers what treatments you want or don’t want now. Given your situation – no immediate life-threatening illness, but wanting to ensure your wishes are known – we can discuss both, but I think starting with a living will might be best. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… yes, that sounds sensible. A living will first. It's just... my memory isn't what it used to be. Would it be alright if… if I took notes? Or perhaps if you could summarise the key points at the end? I don't want to forget anything important, and I certainly don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. Take all the notes you need. I'm happy to summarize at the end as well. It's my job to make sure you understand everything, and no question is too small. Let’s start with what a living will actually covers. Broadly, it addresses what happens if you are unable to make decisions for yourself – things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and hydration… and pain management. We’ll go through each of these, and you can tell me your preferences. First, let's talk about CPR. If your heart were to stop, would you want us to attempt resuscitation?
PATIENT: Resuscitation… that sounds… quite frightening. I suppose… if it was a sudden thing, and there was a reasonable chance… yes. I wouldn’t want to… just stop. But… what does it involve, exactly? I've seen things in films, but… I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery, you understand. It sounds terribly… undignified. Would it be… painful?
DOCTOR: Those are all very reasonable concerns, Ms. Buoniconti. CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation – involves chest compressions and, potentially, a breathing tube to assist with ventilation. It's often depicted dramatically in films, and it can be physically demanding. There is a risk of broken ribs, unfortunately, and it doesn't always work, especially in cases of advanced illness. It’s important to understand that it’s an attempt to restore heart function, and it’s not without risks. As for your concern about artificial life support… that’s something we can certainly address. We would only consider that if there was a reasonable chance of recovery. We would discuss it with you, if possible, and your wishes would be paramount. Do you want to specifically state in your living will that you do want CPR attempted in the event of cardiac arrest?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I suppose… if it was a sudden accident, and there was a real chance of recovery… yes, please attempt it. But… if I was already very ill, or if the doctors felt there was no hope… then no. I don't want to be prolonged needlessly. And… could we put something in there about pain management? I wouldn't want to suffer, if it came to that. Perhaps ensuring I am comfortable, regardless?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very clear, Ms. Buoniconti. So, we’ll document that you do want CPR attempted in the event of a sudden cardiac arrest with a reasonable chance of recovery, but do not want it attempted if you’re already terminally ill or have a poor prognosis. And we’ll definitely include a provision about ensuring you are comfortable and receive appropriate pain management, regardless of the situation. That's a very important point. Now, let’s move on to mechanical ventilation… that’s breathing support using a machine. Have you given any thought to whether you would want that in certain circumstances?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t, Doctor. That sounds… rather unpleasant. I recall seeing my grandmother… she was on a ventilator for a time. It didn’t seem… comfortable. Honestly… I don’t think I would want it. Unless… unless it was just for a short time, to give me a chance to recover. But… long-term? No. I think… I think I’d prefer to let nature take its course, if it came to that. Is that… is that alright? It feels… a bit morbid discussing this, I must admit.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s not morbid at all. These are important discussions to have, and you’re doing the right thing by thinking about them. You’re absolutely entitled to make these decisions, and I’m here to help you articulate your wishes. So, we'll document that you do not want mechanical ventilation long-term. We can also add a clause stating that it’s acceptable for short-term use if it’s deemed necessary and potentially life-saving. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… right. Short-term, if there’s a chance of recovery… but not long-term. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive by machines unnecessarily. What about… artificial nutrition and hydration? I don’t suppose that’s quite as… dramatic as ventilation, but… it's something I hadn't really thought about. I suppose if I couldn’t eat or drink… what would happen?
DOCTOR: Artificial nutrition and hydration, yes. That’s often provided through an IV or a feeding tube. It’s a way to provide sustenance if you’re unable to do so orally. It’s a bit more complex. It can prolong life, but it also has risks, such as infection. Some people prefer to allow nature to take its course in that situation, while others want to be kept alive as long as possible. Have you given any thought to your preferences regarding that?
PATIENT: No… no, I hadn't. It’s all rather overwhelming, isn't it? I suppose… I suppose if I was already very ill, and there was no hope of recovery… then no. I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially. But… if there was a chance I could recover, even a small one… perhaps for a short time? To give me a chance to regain my strength? I don't know… it's difficult to say, honestly. Would it be alright if I thought about that a little longer? It’s all a bit much to process at once.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s perfectly reasonable. It is a lot to process, and you shouldn’t feel pressured to make decisions you’re not comfortable with. We can leave that section open for now, and you can think about it. We’ve covered CPR, mechanical ventilation, and we’ll revisit artificial nutrition and hydration later. We've also touched on pain management, which is something we'll certainly ensure is addressed. Before we move on, do you have any questions about anything we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No… not at the moment, Doctor. I think… I think it’s all sinking in, slowly. It’s just… it’s strange to think about these things, you know? It feels… morbid, but… necessary. I’m grateful you’re explaining it so clearly. Perhaps… perhaps if I could have a copy of everything we’ve discussed? Just so I can… read it over and make sure I understand everything correctly?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. That's a very good idea. I'll have my assistant print out a summary of everything we've discussed today. It will include your preferences regarding CPR, mechanical ventilation, and pain management. You can take your time reviewing it, and we can revisit it at your next appointment. We’ll also add a section for artificial nutrition and hydration once you’ve had a chance to think about it. Do you have any questions about the process itself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. It’s… a weight off my mind, honestly, just knowing I’m doing something to prepare. Perhaps… perhaps I should schedule a follow-up appointment? To discuss the remaining section and finalize everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s an excellent idea, Ms. Buoniconti. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now. That will give you plenty of time to review the summary and think about your preferences regarding artificial nutrition and hydration. My assistant will take care of scheduling that for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you again, for your patience and understanding. It’s… a strange conversation to have, but… a necessary one. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I think I’ll leave it in your capable hands, for now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It was my pleasure. And you've made a very sensible decision. Don't hesitate to reach out if any questions arise before your next appointment. My assistant will see you out. Have a good day. .
