DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been… going to the bathroom rather a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s… disruptive, you understand. I wouldn't say it’s painful, just… frequent. I suppose that’s the best way to put it.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination… alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a good question. Time… it does seem to slip away, doesn’t it? Let me think… several weeks, I believe. Perhaps a month? It’s all a bit… hazy, to be honest. It wasn't a sudden change, more of a gradual increase. I don’t recall a specific date, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: A gradual increase over roughly a month… I see. And are you noticing any other symptoms along with this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Now you have me thinking. I… I suppose I have been feeling a bit more thirsty than usual. I drink a lot of water normally, but perhaps even more recently. No… no fever, no pain in my back, and I don't believe there's been any change in… well, anything else that springs to mind. It’s mainly just the frequent trips to the bathroom and the thirst.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no back pain, just increased frequency and thirst. Do you notice any difference between day and night?
PATIENT: That's a pertinent question, Doctor. Yes, actually… I do. It seems to be… worse at night. I find myself getting up… quite a few times during the night to go. It’s rather unsettling, really. Disrupts my sleep, naturally. During the day it’s… noticeable, certainly, but not quite as disruptive as when I'm trying to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency and nocturia – waking up at night to urinate. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Now that's a name I've heard in connection with… well, with needing to go to the bathroom a lot. I think I was checked for that some years ago, but… I honestly don’t recall the result. Everything is rather… a blur. As for high blood pressure… I believe my general practitioner mentioned it once, but I don’t think I’ve ever been prescribed medication for it. I’ve generally been quite healthy, to be frank. Or, I believe I have been. It’s difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright. Vague recall of a diabetes check, possible mention of high blood pressure. Do you have a list of medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not a list, no. I don’t take anything regularly, Doctor. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a stiff back, but nothing prescribed, just… over-the-counter things. I pride myself on avoiding medication whenever possible. I try to… live a natural life, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. I don’t believe so. Nothing that springs to mind, anyway. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. A bit of a sniffle with certain pollens in the spring, perhaps, but nothing serious. Certainly no food allergies that I’m aware of. I eat rather… everything, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult one. My… my parents are both gone now, and I wasn't particularly close to my siblings, if I'm being honest. I recall my father having… some heart trouble towards the end, I believe. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis, I think. But beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t have much detailed information. We weren't a family that discussed such things openly, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Certainly not recreational drugs. I consider myself a very… temperate man. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but rarely. And I haven’t smoked in… decades. Perhaps a cigarette or two when I was very young, but I quickly gave that up. I believe in looking after one’s health, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, very temperate. One glass of wine occasionally. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Also, I’m going to need a urine sample.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A thorough examination is always a good idea. Blood pressure and pulse, you say? And a urine sample, of course. Yes, quite right. Do let me know if there’s anything specific I should be aware of during the sample collection. I haven’t… provided one in quite some time, you see.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Just a standard sample. Try to collect mid-stream - that means start urinating for a few seconds, then collect the sample in the cup, then finish. I’ll wait here.
PATIENT: Very good. Mid-stream, you say? Yes, I believe I can manage that. A slight… refresher on the procedure was helpful. I shall return presently with the specimen.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. Assembled with… some effort, I must confess. I do hope it’s sufficient.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. I'm going to send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. We'll check for glucose, protein, infection, and other indicators. While we wait for the results, I’d like to ask you one more question. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or increased appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss or increased appetite… hmm. Now that you mention it… I believe I have been losing a little weight recently, but I hadn't consciously noticed it. My clothes feel… a bit looser than they used to. And my appetite… perhaps slightly diminished, but not significantly. I haven’t been eating much less, if that makes sense. It's subtle, I assure you. I suppose it's easy to miss these things when one is… occupied with other matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, slight unintentional weight loss and diminished appetite. Given your increased frequency, nocturia, thirst, unintentional weight loss, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I suspect we need to investigate the possibility of diabetes. The urinalysis will be a good starting point, but we’ll also need a blood glucose test. I’m going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a hemoglobin A1c test. The A1c gives us an average blood sugar level over the past two to three months. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Diabetes… you suspect diabetes? That… doesn’t entirely surprise me, given everything. I’d heard of the frequent urination being a symptom, of course. A comprehensive metabolic panel and an A1c test… Yes, that sounds… thorough. Will these tests require me to fast beforehand? And… what exactly does a hemoglobin A1c test do? I confess my understanding of these medical procedures is rather limited.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw for the comprehensive metabolic panel. You can drink water, but no food. The A1c test doesn’t require fasting. The A1c test measures the percentage of your red blood cells that have sugar attached to them. Sugar attaches to red blood cells over time, so it gives us a picture of your average blood sugar level over the past two to three months. It's a much more accurate indicator than a single blood glucose reading. We'll schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan of action. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your sugar intake and drinking plenty of water. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… fasting until then. Reducing sugar intake… that seems… sensible. Plenty of water, naturally. No, I believe that covers everything for the moment, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. It’s… reassuring to have a plan, even if the prospect of diabetes is… unsettling. Thank you for your time and attention. I shall see you tomorrow then.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Verbos. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the lab results sent to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they arrive. In the unlikely event you develop any fever, significant pain, or difficulty urinating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Have a good evening, and please try not to worry too much until we have the results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Your reassurance is… appreciated. I shall endeavor not to worry unduly. And I will certainly heed your advice regarding fever or pain. Good evening to you as well.
