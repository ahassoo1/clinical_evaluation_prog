DOCTOR: Good morning, Derick. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's this... puffiness, I suppose. Face and legs, mostly. Feels a bit silly, to be honest. It just... happened. Don't rightly know why it happened. Been worse the last few days, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffiness… face and legs. And it’s come on relatively recently, worsening over the last few days. That is good information to start with, and it’s not silly at all to come in and get it checked out. To help me understand a little better, can you describe the puffiness?
PATIENT: Describe it? Hmm. It's… soft, I guess. Not hard. Like… if you poked it, it wouldn’t spring back quick. More like a dent stays for a bit. And it's all over, not just one spot. Both legs, all around my face… cheeks, mostly. It's not painful, just… uncomfortable. Makes my glasses feel tight, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, soft, doesn’t spring back quickly, all over the face and legs… and it’s making your glasses feel tight. That’s helpful. No pain, just discomfort. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – how often you’re going, the color, anything like that?
PATIENT: Urine? Now you're askin' me things... I dunno. I pee like normal, I suppose. Color seems the same as always. Look, I ain't one for lookin' at what goes in the toilet, if you catch my drift. Never been a habit of mine. Is this… is this somethin' serious, Doctor? It just feels like water buildin' up, but… I don't drink that much water.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, you don’t need to routinely check the color. I just ask because changes in urination can sometimes give us clues. It's good you mentioned you haven't been drinking a lot of extra water. And it is good you’re asking if it’s serious. It’s hard to say at this point without a little more information. To get a better picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than feelin' like a balloon… not really. I've been a bit tired, I suppose. Old age, mostly. And my appetite ain’t what it used to be. But that's been goin' on for years. Oh! My shoes have been feelin' a bit snug lately, too. Thought it was just my feet swellin' up in the heat, but maybe it’s the same thing as my legs? I used to be able to slip 'em right on. Now I gotta… well, you know. Struggle a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, decreased appetite, and shoes feeling snug – which you suspect might be related to the leg swelling. That's all useful information. Now, thinking a little bit broader… have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any changes in your heart rate or rhythm?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a bit winded climbin' stairs, but that's been happenin' since my wife… well, a long time ago. Heart… I dunno about my heart. It beats, I suppose. Never felt it doin' anything funny. Look, I ain’t a medical man, Doctor. I just know somethin' feels off. This puffiness… and the tiredness. It's all a bit much.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you're right to come in when things feel "off." You don’t need to be a medical man to tell me what’s going on. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with… hmm. Not that I recall, really. Had a bit of a bad back when I was younger, from all the bendin' and weldin'. But that healed up years ago. My wife… she was the one who went to the doctors all the time. I just… kept workin'. She passed away five years ago, you see. Cancer.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been very difficult. So, no other diagnosed medical conditions, and the back pain was years ago and has resolved. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, I reckon. That's about it. Small thing. And… oh! I had a bit of skin cancer removed off my nose a few years back. Just a little patch. They burned it off, quick as you please. Didn't even need stitches.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix as a child and a small patch of skin cancer removed from your nose. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… not really. I take a couple of aspirin every now and then for a bit of a headache, but that’s it. And a multivitamin, somethin’ my daughter keeps tellin’ me to take. She worries about me. I mostly just drink my coffee, to be honest. Strong coffee. Keeps me goin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin as needed for headaches and a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I'm aware of. I can eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to anything. Used to work around all sorts of fumes and whatnot when I was weldin', but never bothered me none. I think I'm pretty tough, to be honest. Old Swedish stock, you know. We're a hardy bunch.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I’m just going to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any medical conditions, like heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She didn't take care of herself much. Smoked like a chimney. And my father… he just… got old, I reckon. Never really talked about illnesses. My sister… she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, arthritis, I think. But that’s about all I can recall. We weren’t much for talkin' about such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and arthritis in your sister. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Quit that years ago. Tried it when I was younger, but didn't take to it. Smelled awful, and made me cough something fierce. My wife hated it, too. Never touched the stuff since.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? I have a beer with my supper now and then. Just one. Sometimes two if it's a Friday. Never been a big drinker. Never needed to be, I suppose. Keeps me relaxed, that's all. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, one or two beers with supper. And do you do any regular exercise or physical activity?
PATIENT: Exercise? Well, I do a bit of gardenin'. Mostly just weedin' and putterin' around. And I walk to the store now and then, if the weather's nice. But that's about it. I ain't one for runnin' around, Doctor. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. Even gentle activity is good. Okay, Derick, thank you for all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll explain everything as I go along. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Okay, heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/90, and pulse is 78. Now, I'm going to take a look at your legs and feet. I do see some significant swelling in both legs, particularly around the ankles and lower calves. And there is some pitting edema when I press on the skin. That means fluid is being retained. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No signs of enlargement. Alright, Derick, thank you for letting me examine you. I'm going to order some blood and urine tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. This will help us rule out some potential causes of the swelling and fatigue. Would you be able to provide a urine sample for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: Urine sample… right. Yes, I suppose I can manage that. It'll be a bit of a walk to the little room, but I can do it. Blood tests too, eh? Sounds… serious. What are you lookin' for, Doctor? Is it somethin' bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you asked. It could be something serious, but it's just as likely to be something quite manageable. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. We're looking at things like your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and checking for any signs of infection. We'll also check your blood sugar and cholesterol levels, just to get a general picture of your health. And we’ll do a complete blood count to see if there are any issues with your red or white blood cells. The swelling could be caused by a number of things, including kidney problems, heart problems, or even just issues with your veins. The fatigue could be related to the swelling, or it could be something else entirely. We won't know for sure until we get the results back. We'll discuss them thoroughly when we do. Would you like me to explain the process for taking the blood sample as well?
PATIENT: Blood sample… yes, please. I always get nervous with needles. Never been good with 'em. Just… tell me what to expect. And how long will it take to get the results back? I got a bit of gardenin' to do, you see. And I promised my daughter I'd fix her porch swing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles, Derick. We'll take things slow. A phlebotomist – someone trained to draw blood – will tie a small tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. They'll then clean the area with an antiseptic wipe and insert a needle into a vein, usually in the inside of your elbow. You might feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. They'll collect a few tubes of blood and then remove the needle and apply a bandage. It's usually very quick, just a few minutes. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to process everything and get them back to us. I'll give you a call as soon as they're available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible and avoid strenuous activity. And drink plenty of fluids, but don't overdo it. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Rest and fluids… alright. Sounds manageable enough. I think… I think that's all for now, Doctor. Just hope it's not somethin' too bad. My daughter would worry somethin' fierce. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. It helps put my mind at ease a bit.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Derick. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to get to the bottom of this. Remember, we're just gathering information at this point. We’ll have a clearer picture once we get the results back. The nurse will be in shortly to give you instructions for the urine sample and schedule a follow-up appointment. If you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or a significant increase in swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll be in touch within 3-5 business days. Take care, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
