DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? It said my cholesterol is high. Hyper… something. I don’t really understand all the words, but it seemed like I should come talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. It's a rather common finding, unfortunately. It simply means you have high cholesterol. And you’re right to come in and discuss it. Now, Ms. Geho, have you ever been told you have high cholesterol before, or is this the first time?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time anyone has said anything about it. I usually feel pretty good, you know? I eat… reasonably well, I think. Not a lot of fried things. Mostly just regular food. Do you need to know what I eat exactly?
DOCTOR: Well, “reasonably well” is subjective, isn't it?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right! Sorry. It’s just… I don’t keep a food diary or anything. I try not to have too much red meat, lots of vegetables… things like that. And I walk every day, about three miles. Is that helpful information?
DOCTOR: It is, yes. Activity level is certainly relevant. Alright. Let’s try to get a bit more specific, if you don't mind. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Let me think. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with some berries. And coffee, of course! For lunch, maybe a sandwich – turkey or chicken, usually – and a side salad. And then dinner… it varies. Sometimes pasta, sometimes chicken and vegetables, sometimes fish. I do like a little cheese with my dinner, if that matters. And I have a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner, almost every night. It’s a little treat.
DOCTOR: Dark chocolate, interesting. And what kind of milk do you use with your oatmeal?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! I use… 2% milk. Sometimes I use almond milk, but usually 2% milk. Why does that matter? Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Ms. Geho, it’s just… information. Full-fat dairy can contribute to cholesterol levels. Now, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine over the years, thankfully. Just… over-the-counter things for a headache, maybe. Nothing regular. Does that include vitamins, too? Because I take a daily multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Yes, vitamins included. And any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father had… well, he had a heart attack when he was fairly young, maybe in his sixties. And my mother… she had high blood pressure. She took pills for it for years and years. She’s passed away now, but she was always pretty healthy otherwise. Does that help? Is that important information?
DOCTOR: It is. It certainly is. Alright. We're getting a good picture here. Now, Ms. Geho, before we discuss potential next steps, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then, I'll feel your abdomen and check your pulses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever I need to do. Do I need to take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: No, shoes aren’t necessary for this. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm… good. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning on its own. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little brisk. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are… normal. Overall, you appear healthy, Ms. Geho, but these numbers do warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… serious. What does “further investigation” mean? More blood tests? And what about my cholesterol… what exactly is high? Is it the good kind or the bad kind? I feel a little overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It is a bit to take in, I understand. “Further investigation” means we need to get a more detailed lipid panel. That will tell us specifically which types of cholesterol are elevated: LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. LDL is the “bad” cholesterol, the one that contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries. HDL is the “good” cholesterol, which helps remove cholesterol from the arteries. And triglycerides are a type of fat in your blood. Your initial results show an elevated total cholesterol of 240, which is above the optimal range. Without a full panel, it’s difficult to say precisely which numbers are off, but we need that information before we can determine a course of action. I’m going to order a complete lipid panel and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying causes for the elevated cholesterol. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay… that makes a little more sense. So, LDL is the one I need to worry about? And a complete panel will tell me how high it is? What happens if it's really high? Do I have to go on medication right away? I’m not really keen on taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, “need to worry about” is rather dramatic, Ms. Geho. Elevated LDL can increase your risk of heart disease, certainly. And a complete panel will provide that information. As for medication, that depends entirely on your overall risk factors and the results of the panel. We’ll discuss lifestyle modifications first, of course: diet, exercise, stress management. If those aren’t enough to lower your cholesterol, then we may consider medication. But we’re not at that stage yet. I'm sending the orders to the lab now. You should be able to schedule an appointment within the next few days. Once you have the results, the lab will notify my office, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to focus on a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. So, no need to panic right away. Diet and exercise first. Okay. That’s good. About the diet… are there any specific foods I should definitely avoid? Like, is cheese completely off-limits? And what kind of exercise is best? Is walking enough, or should I be doing something more strenuous? I’m just trying to get a head start, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s not about completely avoiding foods, Ms. Geho, it's about moderation. Limit saturated and trans fats—those are found in red meat, processed foods, and some dairy products. Cheese is… permissible, but in small quantities. Opt for lower-fat varieties. And as for exercise, walking is a good start, but aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Something that gets your heart rate up. I’ll print out a handout on heart-healthy eating and exercise. It’s rather basic, but it's a good starting point. Do you have any other questions, or shall we conclude the appointment for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. The handout sounds great. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll schedule the lab appointment as soon as I can. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. See to that. And remember, moderation is key. Have a good day.
