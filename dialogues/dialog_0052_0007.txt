DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. That’s why I am here. I work with fences, you see. It hurts to do my job. I want to get it fixed so I can keep working.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain interfering with your work is certainly concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… in my back. Lower back, mostly. Feels like a dull ache, always there when I wake up. But when I’m lifting… or bending… it gets sharp. Real sharp. It makes me stop. I have to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache in your lower back that worsens with lifting and bending, becoming sharp enough to stop you. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: About… three months, I think. Maybe a little longer. It started slow. Just a little stiff after work. But it’s gotten worse each week. I tried to ignore it. You know, tough it out. But now… now it’s hard to even get out of bed some mornings.
DOCTOR: Three months, gradually worsening. And it's now affecting your ability to get out of bed. That sounds quite disruptive. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain – any positions, activities, or medications that offer relief?
PATIENT: Not really. Resting helps a little, I suppose. But I can’t just rest. I have bills to pay. Hot showers feel good for a few minutes, but it comes back. I haven't taken anything for it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. My husband… he used to have some things for aches, but… well, he’s gone now. I haven’t gotten around to getting any myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s admirable that you’ve been trying to manage this on your own for so long. And I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Before we move forward, could you describe your typical workday?
PATIENT: Thank you. It's… hard sometimes. My workday… We build fences. Mostly wood, some wire. Lots of lifting posts, digging holes, hammering. It's physical work. I usually start around seven, work 'til five, sometimes later if we have a big job. Lots of bending and reaching, twisting. It's… it's a lot on my back. We work outside, rain or shine. It's hard work.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly strenuous, Ms. Reihner. It’s no surprise your back is experiencing difficulties. Now, I’d like to ask about your overall health. Have you had any previous medical conditions, surgeries, or serious injuries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. Nothing serious. Had the measles as a kid, like everyone else. Other than that… no. No surgeries. No big injuries. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess. My husband… he had problems with his heart. But that was him, not me. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Just for check-ups, when I was younger. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, measles, and otherwise generally healthy. No significant medical history of your own. And your husband had heart issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I told you, I don’t like taking pills. Nothing at all. Just water. And coffee, to get me through the day. That’s it. I try to eat healthy, when I can. But it’s hard when you’re working all day. It’s mostly sandwiches and apples. Simple things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And a relatively simple diet. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any back problems, arthritis, or other musculoskeletal conditions?
PATIENT: My mother had bad arthritis in her hands. Real bad. She couldn’t knit anymore towards the end. And my grandfather… he had a bad back, I think. He worked on a farm all his life. Lots of bending and lifting. That’s all I really know. We didn’t talk much about health things. It wasn’t something we did. I don't know much about my father's side of the family. He left when I was little.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, Ms. Reihner, before we proceed to a physical examination, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I don’t have any allergies. Never have. I can eat anything. I don’t get hives or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Just… this back. It's the only thing that’s ever bothered me. Really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Ms. Reihner, I'd like to perform a physical examination of your back to assess the source of your pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that’s fine. Let’s get it over with. I need to get back to work, if I can. The sooner we figure it out, the better. I just want to be able to do my job.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll do our best. Please lie face down on the examination table for me. I’m going to start by palpating your spine to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. I’m noting some muscle guarding in your lower back, Ms. Reihner, and mild tenderness to palpation around L4-L5. This is common with lower back pain. Now, I’m going to assess your range of motion. Can you gently try to bend forward, reaching towards your knees?
PATIENT: Okay. It hurts when I do that. Real sharp pain right there… Not much further I can go. It just… stops. Feels like something is blocking me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Limited range of motion with sharp pain at L4-L5. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Please keep your legs relaxed as I tap on your knees and ankles. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally, which is normal. Sensation is intact in both legs and feet. Now, I’m going to perform a straight leg raise test. Please keep your leg straight as I lift it up. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg.
PATIENT: Okay… Ouch! Yes! Right down my leg! It’s like… an electric shock. It goes all the way to my foot. I can feel it. Stop! Please stop. It’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner, I’m stopping immediately. That positive straight leg raise test, with pain radiating down your leg, is significant. Based on the physical examination and your history, I strongly suspect you may have a lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy – meaning a pinched nerve in your lower back causing pain to radiate down your leg. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to visualize the discs and nerves in your back and determine the extent of any injury. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… Yes. Yes, that’s fine. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong. And I want it fixed. I can’t keep missing work. Is it… is it serious? Do I need surgery? I don’t want surgery. I’ve heard bad things about surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Reihner. It’s natural to be worried. Most lumbar disc herniations do not require surgery. Many people improve with conservative treatment – things like physical therapy, pain medication, and injections. The MRI will help us determine the severity of the herniation and guide our treatment plan. We’ll discuss all your options in detail once we have the results. I will also order some bloodwork to rule out any other underlying conditions that could be contributing to your pain. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of muscle relaxants and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – ibuprofen – to help manage your pain and inflammation. I’ll also give you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in lower back pain. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your core and improve your posture. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes… I guess so. Medicine and therapy… That sounds better than surgery. I can try that. When will I get the results of the MRI? And when can I see the therapist? I need to get back to work, Doctor. I have bills to pay. This is… stressful. .
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Reihner. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The MRI will be scheduled at the imaging center down the street. You should receive a call within 24-48 hours to schedule the appointment. Once the results are in, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, typically within 3-5 business days. The physical therapist can likely get you in within the next week. They’ll assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. In the meantime, avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. Use proper body mechanics when moving, and apply heat or ice to your lower back as needed. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Reihner?
