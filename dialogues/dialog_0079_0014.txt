DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, uh… well, it’s about some paperwork, I think. My wife, she handles most of these things, but she said something about needing forms filled out. Something to do with… time off? I’m not quite sure, to be honest. It's for work, definitely. Something about… needing a little help, you see. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Right. Forms for time off… I see. And is this related to a specific medical issue, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking something… tricky. See, things haven't been… clear, lately. I’ve been feeling a bit… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… tired, mostly. And a little… confused sometimes. It's hard to explain. It’s been going on for a little while now, but I just figured it was… getting older, you know? My wife thought it might be worth getting checked out. She's a smart woman, my wife. She thinks this paperwork is for… FMLA, maybe? Or something like that? I really don't follow these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness and some confusion… and your wife is concerned about FMLA. Just to clarify, Mr. Limtiaco, by "confusion," are we talking about difficulty remembering things, trouble focusing, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, remembering things is… a challenge, definitely. Little things, mostly. Names, dates… where I put my glasses! It's not all the time, but enough to make things… frustrating. And sometimes, I feel like I’m not quite… with it, you know? Like my thoughts are a little slow, or… foggy. Not always, but often enough that my wife noticed. She says I repeat myself sometimes, too. I don’t remember doing that, though! It’s all a bit muddled, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Memory issues, some difficulty with focus, and your wife has noticed repetition. And when did you first start noticing these symptoms, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a hard one. It didn't happen all at once, you see. It's been… gradual. Maybe six months ago? Perhaps longer? Everything blends together these days. I'd say… around the holidays, maybe? Last Christmas? Yes, I think it was around then when my wife started to… mention it. Before that, I just thought I was… getting old. It's hard to pinpoint, honestly. It wasn't a sudden thing, more like… a slow fading, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. My wife says I've been a bit… quieter than usual. I used to enjoy chatting with the neighbors, you see, but lately, I haven’t felt much like it. And… well, this might sound silly, but I sometimes get a little… lost. Not driving, thankfully, but even in familiar places, like the grocery store. I know where I am, generally, but… it takes me a moment to orient myself. It's not a big deal, usually, but it’s been happening more often. And I’ve been sleeping… a lot. More than I used to, that’s for sure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. Quietness, some disorientation, and increased sleepiness. Do you have any history of medical conditions, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmmm. Let me see… I had a bout of shingles a few years back, very painful that was. And high blood pressure, the doctor has been watching that for… oh, a long time now. I take medicine for it, regularly. Apart from that… nothing major, that I recall. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you see. I've always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. My wife keeps me in check, you see. She's very good at reminding me to take my pills!
DOCTOR: Alright. Shingles, hypertension… and you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure. Do you recall what medication you are on, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… now you're asking about names again. My wife handles all that, you see. I just take the pills she gives me. It's a little white one… and a little blue one. And sometimes a yellow one. She puts them in these little containers, labeled with the days of the week. I think one of them is… Lisinopril? Is that right? I'm not sure about the others. I really don’t pay attention to the names, just the schedule. She's very organized, my wife. Very organized! I wish I had her memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll confirm the medication list. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmmm. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago now. And… oh, yes! I had a knee replacement a few years back. The left one. It's been good as new ever since, thankfully. Apart from that… I don’t think so. Nothing major, that I recall. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Or maybe it's just that my memory is… fading. It's hard to tell these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy, knee replacement. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. My wife knows all that, you see. She did all the research. My mother… she had some trouble with her memory towards the end. I think it was… Alzheimer’s? Or something like that. It was a long time ago now. My father… he was healthy as a horse, well into his nineties. He never had a sick day in his life, as far as I know. Apart from that… I don’t really know. We didn't talk about these things much, growing up. It wasn’t something we… focused on. It's all a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of memory issues. And finally, what about your social history, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Social history… oh dear. Well, I'm retired now, used to be in… religious activities, you see. Education, mostly. I’ve been married to my wife, Helene, for… goodness, almost fifty years now. We have two grown children, both living on the mainland. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I used to be very active in the community, but… lately, I haven’t been going out much. I mostly stay home with my wife now. It’s a quiet life, but… it’s a good life. A very good life, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Let me see… Not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with food, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medications. My wife always checks when she gets my prescriptions, you see. She’s very careful. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, but… if I am, I haven't discovered it yet. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Or maybe it’s just that my memory is… Well, I don't think I have any allergies. I'm pretty sure. But ask my wife, she'll know for sure. She always knows.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've told me, you're experiencing fatigue, some memory issues, and increased sleepiness, with a family history of dementia. It's difficult to say definitively what's causing these symptoms without further evaluation. I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment to get a better understanding of your current mental state. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A cognitive assessment? Oh… well, if you think it's necessary. I’m not very good at tests, you see. My memory isn’t what it used to be, as you know. But… if it will help, then yes. Yes, alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just… take it easy on me, okay? I'll try my best. But don't be surprised if I… stumble a little. It's just… been a bit of a foggy time lately, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. We'll take it slow. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Let's start with something easy. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh… today’s date… Let me see… is it… August? Yes, I think it’s August. But the day… I’m afraid I’m not quite sure. Is it the… first? No… I get so confused. I really can't remember the exact date. My wife always keeps track of these things. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh… the city… Is this… Honolulu? No… I… I get so mixed up. We've traveled a bit, you see, over the years. It's… a small town, isn’t it? Quiet… I can’t quite recall the name. It's… rural, I think. I’m so sorry. It’s right on the tip of my tongue… but I just can't… grasp it.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We are in a rural location, but we're currently in Waimea. Now, let’s try something else. I’m going to name three objects, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Three objects… Yes, alright. I’ll try my best. It might take me a moment, you see. But… yes. Ready. Go ahead. I’ll… focus.
DOCTOR: The three objects are: apple, table, and penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table… I think… was it… key? No, penny. Apple, table, penny. Yes. Did I… get it right? It's hard to… hold them in my mind, you see. It feels like they're… slipping away already.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards.
PATIENT: Oh… backwards? Spell “world” backwards… That’s… a tricky one. Let me see… “world”… d-l-r-o-w? No… that doesn't sound right. It's… it’s been a long time since I had to spell things backwards. I’m afraid I just can’t seem to… get it. I'm so sorry. My mind is… blank. Is it alright if we… skip this one?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We can skip that one. Finally, I'm going to ask you a simple question: Why are you here today?
PATIENT: Why am I here today…? Oh… goodness. That’s… a good question. I… I think… my wife said something about paperwork? Something about… time off? Yes, that's it. I needed forms filled out. Something to do with my work… or maybe my health. It's all a bit… muddled, you see. I just want to… get this sorted out, so I can go home and relax with my wife. Is that… right? I really can’t remember the specifics. It’s just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for your patience. Based on this brief assessment, and the information you've provided, you are exhibiting signs of cognitive impairment, including memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with language and orientation. While this does not definitively diagnose anything, it warrants further investigation. I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including an MRI of the brain, and blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. I will also refer you to a neurologist specializing in dementia. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. A neurological evaluation? Dementia? I… I don’t know what to say. I just wanted some paperwork filled out. Is it… is it bad? I mean… am I… sick? My wife… she’ll be so worried. I don’t want to… worry her. What does this mean? And what about… the paperwork? Will I still be able to… get the time off? I just… I just want to understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious. We are not making a definitive diagnosis at this point. Further testing is needed to determine the cause of your symptoms. Dementia is a broad term, and there are many possible causes, some of which are treatable. It's important to remember that we will work together to understand what's happening and develop a plan. Regarding the paperwork, yes, we will still complete the necessary forms for your time off. This evaluation doesn't change that. We can address that after we've discussed the results of the testing. I want to assure you that you are not alone in this. We will involve your wife in the process, and she will be fully informed and supported. Would you like me to schedule an appointment with the neurologist immediately?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Schedule the appointment. And… and please, involve my wife. She needs to know. She… she’s the strong one. I… I don't think I can handle this on my own. What about… what about the results? How long will it take? And… and what if it is something bad? Will I… will I still be able to… recognize my wife? I just… I just want to know what’s happening. And I want to be… prepared.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it’s alright to be scared, and it’s good that you're expressing your concerns. We will take this one step at a time. I will schedule the neurology appointment for the earliest available date, which I believe is next week. The results will take some time to come back – typically a few days to a week after the appointment. Regarding your concern about recognizing your wife, it’s impossible to predict the outcome at this stage. Dementia affects everyone differently, and the progression varies greatly. We will do everything we can to provide you with the best possible care and support, regardless of the results. I'm going to have my nurse come in and explain the next steps in more detail, including the necessary paperwork for the neurology appointment and contact information for support groups. We will also make sure your wife is informed and involved in the process. For now, please try to focus on taking care of yourself and your wife. We are here to help you navigate this. Do you have any other immediate questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you. Thank you for… being honest. And for… not dismissing me. I just… I need to go home. And tell my wife. She'll know what to do. She always does. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I think I can find my way out. .
