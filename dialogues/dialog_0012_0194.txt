DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. Sort of going quiet on me, and then I get really dizzy. It’s hard to explain, really. Happens out of nowhere. And my husband… he had the same thing, years ago. That’s why I thought I should come in. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is unsettling. Ears going quiet and dizziness… and your husband had something similar, that's good information. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When you say “going quiet,” does that mean you're losing your hearing, or is it more like a muffled feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… muffled, I think. Not completely gone, just… like someone turned down the volume. It doesn't last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe. Sometimes it happens in one ear, sometimes both. It’s… difficult to remember exactly when it happens, to be honest. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be. Is that… helpful? I hope so.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. It’s perfectly normal to not remember every detail, don't worry about that. Muffled hearing, sometimes in one ear, sometimes both, lasting a few minutes… Okay. And the dizziness – can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The dizziness… It's like the room is spinning, you know? Or I’m spinning. Hard to tell which. And I get a bit… wobbly. Have to hold onto something. It's… frightening, especially when I’m cooking. I’ve nearly fallen a couple of times. It usually happens with the quiet ears, but not always. Sometimes it just comes on its own. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it perfectly fine, Terasa. It sounds concerning, and I'm glad you came in. Room spinning, wobbliness, sometimes with the muffled hearing, sometimes on its own… Okay. Let's talk a little bit more about when this started. Roughly when did you first notice the muffled hearing and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a tricky one. It’s been coming and going for a while now. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s hard to pinpoint. It started very subtly, I think. Just a little off-balance sometimes, and I put it down to getting older. Then the quiet ears started, and I thought… well, I thought it was just my ears. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. My memory… it's not what it used to be. Is it important to be exact?
DOCTOR: It's okay if it's not exact, Terasa. We'll figure it out. Six months to a year, coming and going… that gives us a starting point. And you're right to be concerned, especially with it being intermittent. Now, besides the ears and dizziness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Sometimes I feel a bit… full in my ear, like there’s pressure. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. And I've been a little more tired than usual, but that could be anything, I suppose. I’ve been… keeping busy. And maybe a little bit of ringing in my ears, but it’s very faint. Hardly noticeable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what’s connected and what isn’t. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness in the ear, more tired than usual, and faint ringing… Those could definitely be related. It’s good you’re telling me everything, even if you're not sure if it's important. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a bit of… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a pill for it, every day. And I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Nothing else, really. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk when I can. And I used to enjoy gardening, but it's harder now, with the dizziness. Oh, and I have Medicare, if that’s important. My husband had Medicare too. Is that enough? I always forget things…
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. High blood pressure, managed with medication, gallbladder removal… and Medicare. You’re doing great remembering everything. It’s perfectly normal to forget things, don’t worry about it. Okay, I see your blood pressure is generally well-controlled. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No, not that I can recall. Just the little orange pill for my blood pressure. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knees, if they’re acting up, but that’s only occasionally. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the nurse recommended it last winter. But that’s it, I think. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it. It all makes me a bit… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Just the blood pressure medication, occasional pain reliever, and a vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things. I’m not a fussy eater. My husband… he was allergic to shellfish, but I’m not. No, I don’t have any allergies, as far as I’m aware. I hope I haven’t forgotten something… it’s just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: You haven't forgotten anything, Terasa. No known allergies. That’s good to know. Okay, one last thing about your medical history. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions, like hearing loss, dizziness, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my husband, yes. Like I said, he had the dizziness, really bad. He went to specialists for it, years ago. And his mother… she lost her hearing, when she got older. Very gradually, but she ended up needing hearing aids. And my uncle… he had heart problems, I think. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember all the details. It’s… a bit of a family thing, I suppose. Not a good thing, but… it happens. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. History of dizziness in your husband, hearing loss in his mother, and heart problems in your uncle. That gives us some important context. Okay, Terasa, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, and do a little balance test. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. I'm a bit wobbly as it is, so be careful! I trust your judgment. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart and lungs sound clear, good rhythm, no unusual sounds. Your ear canals look clear. The eardrums themselves look… slightly cloudy, but no obvious signs of infection or fluid buildup. Okay, now let’s try standing with your feet together, arms at your sides. And can you close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is… tricky. Yes, feet together… eyes closed… I feel a bit… unsteady. It’s worse with my eyes closed. Do you need to… help me?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It is more difficult with your eyes closed, and you’re swaying a bit. That’s helpful information. It indicates a possible issue with your vestibular system – that’s the part of your inner ear that controls balance. Okay, please sit back down. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis. These are inflammations of the inner ear that can cause dizziness, muffled hearing, and balance problems. It’s often caused by a viral infection. But we need to rule out other possible causes. I'm going to order a simple hearing test, called an audiogram, to get a better idea of the extent of your hearing loss. And I also want to order some blood tests to rule out any other medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Inflammations…? Viruses…? It sounds… complicated. A hearing test… and blood tests… Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again, you know? I’m a bit worried, but… I trust you. As long as it helps figure out what’s wrong. And it won’t take too long, will it? I have a bit of a… schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. The tests are relatively simple and shouldn’t take long. The hearing test will take about 30-45 minutes, and the blood test will only take a few minutes. We can schedule the hearing test for later this week, and you can get the blood test done at the lab right down the hall anytime. While we're waiting for the test results, I’m going to recommend a medication called meclizine. It's an antihistamine that can help with the dizziness and nausea. It won't cure the problem, but it can help manage your symptoms in the meantime. It is available over the counter, or I can write you a prescription. Would you like me to write you a prescription, or would you prefer to get it over the counter?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Meclizine… to help with the dizziness… Yes, that sounds good. If you don’t mind, Doctor, could you write me a prescription? I… I don’t really want to have to go out and buy it. It's just… a bit much, you know? All of this. I appreciate you doing that for me. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Is there anything else I need to do? Or know? Or… anything I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Terasa. I’m happy to write you a prescription. Here you go. This should help manage the dizziness. As for things to be worried about, the most important thing is to avoid any activities that could be dangerous if you were to lose your balance, like driving or climbing ladders. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like severe headache, fever, double vision, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. These could be signs of a more serious condition. We’ll follow up in about a week after the test results are back to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I’m giving you a handout with information about vestibular disorders and meclizine as well. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Severe headache… fever…? That sounds… frightening. No, I… I think that’s all for now. I just want to get home and rest. And… hopefully the meclizine will help. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much for everything. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness. I think I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take it easy, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in about a week.
