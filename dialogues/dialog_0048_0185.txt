DOCTOR: Right. Zelina Ambris, 18 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s my breath. It smells…bad. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. I just want it fixed, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Bad breath, alright. And how long has this been…troubling you?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know. A while. Probably since…the divorce, actually. Everything just kind of went downhill then, you know? It’s not like I’ve been going on dates or anything, but still. It’s just…there.
DOCTOR: The divorce…right. Well, while emotional distress can sometimes manifest physically, we need to rule out more concrete causes for halitosis. Are you brushing and flossing regularly?
PATIENT: Of course I am! Do you think I just…don't care about hygiene? I'm not that kind of person. I brush twice a day, sometimes more if I have something important to do. And I floss…when I remember. Is that really the problem? It just…doesn’t feel like it’s something simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be defensive. “Sometimes” isn’t ideal, but we’ll move past that. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t know… I guess my mouth feels a little dry sometimes. But honestly, everyone’s mouth gets dry. Is that what you mean? Look, I work outside, okay? Highway maintenance. It's hot. It’s dusty. It’s not exactly a spa day.
DOCTOR: Highway maintenance…right. And any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? No. Not really. Same as always, I guess. Coffee, mostly. Gotta have my coffee to get through the day. And whatever fast food is quickest when I'm on break. Why is this taking so long? It's just bad breath.
DOCTOR: Coffee and fast food… Well, those can certainly contribute. Let’s have a quick look. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I have things to do. It's not like I can just sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tongue appears slightly coated, some redness along the gums. No obvious cavities or lesions. Throat looks… unremarkable. I don’t see anything immediately concerning, but your gums are inflamed. Do you have any family history of gum disease?
PATIENT: Gum disease? My grandma had really bad teeth, if that counts. She lost most of them. But honestly, she smoked like a chimney, so I doubt that's relevant. Look, are you going to give me something for it or what? I really don't have time for a whole family history investigation. It's my breath, not a medical mystery.
DOCTOR: It is relevant. And frankly, your attitude isn’t helping. Look, I'm going to recommend a thorough professional cleaning and a course of improved oral hygiene. Brush after every meal, floss daily, and consider a mouthwash. We can also rule out other possibilities, like…sinus issues. But frankly, it sounds like a lack of diligent care. I’ll write you a prescription for a chlorhexidine mouthwash. Use as directed. Here's a handout on proper brushing and flossing techniques. I suggest you read it. .
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Look, I have to get back to work. Can I just go? This was a waste of my time. .
