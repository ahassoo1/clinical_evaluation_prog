DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m…concerned about my weight. It’s been going up, and I haven’t really done anything to cause it. It’s quite unsettling, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weight fluctuations can be unsettling, and it's good you're addressing it. When you say it's been going up, about how long has this been happening, and roughly how much weight are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…it started, I’d say, around…November of last year. So, about nine months now. And… approximately 15 pounds, perhaps a little more. It’s not a dramatic change weekly, but it’s noticeable in my clothes, and…I feel it, you know? It’s just…unexpected.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Unexpected weight gain, even gradual, is worth investigating. And nine months is certainly enough time to warrant a look. Besides the weight gain itself, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me see…I suppose I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? My husband says I’ve been a bit…moodier, but he also says I’m always moody, so… No, I can’t really pinpoint anything else significant. No changes in appetite, no trouble sleeping…just the weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No significant changes in appetite or sleep are good to know. And it’s good you’re aware of your energy levels and mood. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing diagnosed. I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. A few colds, naturally, and a bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but nothing serious. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries… I've been very fortunate, I suppose. I do have a family history of… well, my grandmother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. But that’s the only thing I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know about your general health and the family history of type 2 diabetes – that's important information. And it sounds like you've been very proactive about your health so far. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I try to manage everything through diet and exercise, though lately…well, that’s been a little difficult with everything. Just the normal vitamins, a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Absolutely no prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And it’s good you prioritize diet and exercise. Before we move on, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat anything, take any medication… though, as I said, I rarely do. My husband always jokes I have a cast-iron stomach. It’s a blessing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, Reneisha, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look at your thyroid. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I understand the necessity of a thorough examination, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 83 kilograms. Your blood pressure is 132/88, pulse is 78 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Your thyroid feels normal to the touch, no palpable nodules or enlargement. Everything sounds and feels normal so far, but given your weight gain and family history, I would like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions like thyroid issues or pre-diabetes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood work seems a prudent step. Absolutely, please proceed. I want to understand what’s happening, and if that’s the best way to find out, then please do so. I'd rather be safe than sorry, as they say. What exactly will the blood work entail? And where will I need to go to have it done?
DOCTOR: Good. I agree, it's best to be thorough. The blood work will be a standard panel – we'll check your complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone , blood glucose, cholesterol, and a few other basic metabolic markers. It will give us a good baseline understanding of your overall health and help rule out some common causes of weight gain. You can have the blood work done at the clinic’s lab, right here. I’ll give you a lab requisition form. You don't need to fast beforehand, but please drink plenty of water. They usually can take the samples right away, or you can schedule an appointment if that is easier for you. Do you have any questions about the procedure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds quite straightforward. No fasting is good, as I hadn't planned on it. And I can do it right here at the clinic, which is very convenient. No, I don't think I have any further questions at this time. Just… how long will it take to get the results back? And will I need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to process the results. I'll have the nurse contact you as soon as they're available. And yes, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week would be fine, Doctor. Perhaps…Wednesday afternoon? If that works for your schedule, of course. I’m fairly flexible. I’m just eager to get to the bottom of this. It's been rather unsettling, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Wednesday afternoon works perfectly. Let's schedule you for Wednesday at 2:30 PM. The nurse will send you a reminder. In the meantime, try to maintain your regular diet and activity levels as much as possible, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any new or concerning symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I feel much more reassured knowing we're taking this seriously. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner. Wednesday at 2:30 PM is perfect. I look forward to hearing from you then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. It’s my pleasure. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and I'll see you on Wednesday.
PATIENT: .
