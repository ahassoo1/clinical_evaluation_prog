DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. The blood pressure thing… my husband made me come. Says I’m getting too stressed with work. Honestly, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Dudeney, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. Your husband’s concern is certainly thoughtful. While you may feel fine, elevated blood pressure doesn’t always present with noticeable symptoms. It’s important to investigate nonetheless. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what your work entails?
PATIENT: It's… engineering. Civil engineering. I do a lot of site surveys, check blueprints, make sure things are built right. It's a lot of responsibility, okay? People rely on what I do. It’s not like… sitting at a desk all day. I’m outside a lot, running numbers, dealing with contractors. It's… complicated. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary to gather a complete picture, Ms. Dudeney, and your work certainly sounds demanding. The physical and mental stress involved in civil engineering can absolutely contribute to blood pressure fluctuations. Knowing the specifics helps me assess the situation accurately. When you say “complicated,” could you elaborate on what aspects of the job are most stressful or challenging for you?
PATIENT: Ugh. The people, mostly. The contractors are always trying to cut corners. The city inspectors are… particular. And everyone thinks they're an expert. I have to explain things constantly. And then there’s the paperwork. Mountains of it. It’s just… frustrating. Honestly, I spend half my day putting out fires and the other half explaining basic math. Do you need to know this? It’s wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Dudeney. Knowing the sources of your stress is incredibly helpful. It’s not a waste of your time at all; it informs my understanding of your overall health picture. To get a better sense of how this might be affecting you physically, could you describe any symptoms you have noticed, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I feel fine. No symptoms. Maybe a headache sometimes, but that’s just from the sun. Everyone gets headaches. I don’t sit around cataloging every little ache and pain. I have work to do. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudeney. I assure you, I am trying to be efficient. Even seemingly minor symptoms can be indicators of a larger issue. A headache from the sun is certainly plausible, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. Let’s try this: have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? No. Not really. Everything looks… normal. I wear glasses, okay? I've worn them since I was a kid. What does vision have to do with anything? This is ridiculous. Are you even listening to me? I told you I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I am listening carefully, Ms. Dudeney. It's important to note that high blood pressure can sometimes affect vision, even if subtly. The fact that you wear glasses is relevant, as changes in your vision could be related to your blood pressure, or simply a need for a new prescription. To continue, have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: No. I haven't fallen or anything. I don’t go around tripping over things. Look, I’m a practical person, alright? I’m not going to sit here and list off a bunch of imaginary ailments. I came because my husband told me to. That’s it. Can we just… get this over with? Take my blood pressure and tell me if it’s bad or not. I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for expediency, Ms. Dudeney, and I respect your practicality. It’s helpful to know you haven’t experienced any dizziness. Very well. I will take your blood pressure now. To get the most accurate reading, could you please tell me if you've had any caffeine today, or used any over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Just coffee, this morning. One cup. And… I took some ibuprofen yesterday. My back was bothering me from bending over blueprints all day. Look, is this really going to change anything? I’m telling you, I’m fine. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. Both caffeine and ibuprofen can temporarily elevate blood pressure, so it’s good to know. I’ll take those factors into consideration. Your blood pressure is elevated, Ms. Dudeney – 148/92 mmHg. While a single reading isn’t definitive, this is high enough to warrant further investigation. It does appear your husband had a valid concern.
PATIENT: See? I knew something was off. But it's probably just the coffee. And the ibuprofen. And… all the stress. Honestly, if you want to know the truth, I barely sleep. I’m always thinking about work. Is that… bad? Can you fix it? I need to be able to function. I have people relying on me.
DOCTOR: It's good you're acknowledging these factors, Ms. Dudeney. Lack of sleep and chronic stress are both significant contributors to hypertension, as is the situation with the caffeine and ibuprofen. It’s not simply “probably” the coffee; those factors contribute, but we need to determine the underlying cause. To clarify, when you say you barely sleep, could you estimate how many hours of sleep you typically get per night?
PATIENT: Ugh. Four. Maybe five, if I’m lucky. I wake up constantly, going over things in my head. Blueprints, calculations, deadlines… I just… can’t shut it off. It’s exhausting. Honestly, I’m running on fumes. And I don’t have time for sleep. There’s too much to do. Is there a pill I can take? Something that will just… fix it? Quickly?
DOCTOR: Four to five hours of sleep is significantly below the recommended amount. Chronic sleep deprivation contributes directly to both elevated blood pressure and overall stress levels. We definitely need to address this. There are medications that can help manage high blood pressure, Ms. Dudeney, but they are most effective when combined with lifestyle modifications. A pill alone won’t resolve the underlying issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask some questions about your diet and exercise habits. Additionally, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, including listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I eat when I can. Mostly fast food. Grab something on the way to the site. It’s convenient. And exercise? What exercise? I’m too busy. Honestly, I don't have time for all this. A physical exam? Really? I'm a perfectly healthy person. This is a waste of time. But… fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But I’m telling you, it won’t show anything. I’m fine. Mostly. I just need to get back to work. Can we hurry this up?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudeney, and I assure you I'll be as efficient as possible. It's important to remember that even seemingly healthy individuals can have underlying health concerns. A brief exam will help me assess your overall condition and determine the best course of action. "Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Peripheral pulses are present and equal in all extremities. Reflexes are within normal limits. No focal neurological deficits noted. Blood pressure is still elevated at 152/95 mmHg." "Based on this initial assessment, Ms. Dudeney, and given your reported sleep deprivation and dietary habits, I suspect your elevated blood pressure is likely multifactorial, potentially related to stress, lifestyle factors, and possibly underlying sleep apnea. However, we need to rule out other potential causes." "To do that, I recommend a few additional tests: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels, and an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart rhythm. We should also consider a sleep study to rule out sleep apnea."
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Seriously? This is ridiculous. A sleep study? I barely have time to sleep, let alone go somewhere and have people monitor me while I try to sleep. Look, can’t you just give me something for the blood pressure? Something to calm me down? I have a deadline. This is all going to take too long. I’m starting to get a headache. Honestly, I should have just ignored my husband. This is a waste of my precious time. Can we just skip the tests? Please? I feel like I’m wasting a whole day on this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudeney, and I apologize for the inconvenience. However, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible, and potentially harmful. We need to understand the cause of your elevated blood pressure before we can determine the best course of treatment. Skipping the tests is not an option, I'm afraid. These are standard procedures to rule out any underlying medical conditions. While I understand you have a deadline, your health is paramount. "We can schedule these tests efficiently. The blood work can be done here at the clinic today. The ECG can also be performed quickly. Regarding the sleep study, we can discuss options for at-home sleep monitoring, which would be less disruptive to your schedule. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. At-home sleep monitoring. Only because you said at-home. But I’m telling you, it won't show anything. I just… lie awake thinking. It’s not like I’m snoring or anything. And the blood work… fine. Get it over with. But can we please hurry this up? I have a meeting this afternoon. And honestly, I’m starting to feel lightheaded. Maybe it’s just the stress. Just get the blood work done. Now. And then tell me what I need to do to get back to work. I really need to go.
DOCTOR: “Very well. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now. We will get the results as quickly as possible. While we wait, I’ll write you a referral for the at-home sleep study and provide you with detailed instructions. “In the meantime, I want to emphasize the importance of stress management. While we are waiting for test results, consider incorporating relaxation techniques into your daily routine, even for a few minutes. Simple things like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation can be helpful. Also, please avoid caffeine and limit your intake of processed foods. “You mentioned feeling lightheaded. If that sensation worsens, or if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please seek immediate medical attention. It’s always best to err on the side of caution. I will also have the nurse check your blood pressure again before you leave.”
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I barely have time for all this. Relaxation techniques? Mindfulness meditation? Seriously? I have deadlines, people relying on me. But… okay. I’ll try. But no promises. And I’ll avoid caffeine. Maybe. But honestly, I need it to function. Just… get the blood work done. And tell me when it will be ready. I really need to go. This is a complete waste of my time. I bet this will show nothing. Honestly. Nothing. Just… hurry. And then I’m leaving. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: "The lab technician is here now. The blood draw will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please let the nurse know if you begin to feel unwell. “I understand your concerns and I appreciate your willingness to undergo these tests. I am confident that we can identify the cause of your elevated blood pressure and develop a plan to help you regain control of your health. “Thank you for your patience, Ms. Dudeney. And please, do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. " .
