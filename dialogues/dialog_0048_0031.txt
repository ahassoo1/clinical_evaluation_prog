DOCTOR: Right. Nixon Kreckel. Eighteen years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It’s been gettin’ worse the last few days. And, um, the doctor told me a while back it was somethin’ with my heart… atrial… somethin’? It makes my heart beat funny sometimes. I think that’s got somethin’ to do with it.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, most likely. Yes, I see a note from a previous provider. “Possible atrial fibrillation.” And the leg swelling… is it just one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, doctor. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big. And kinda achy if I stand for too long. It feels… heavy, I suppose is the best way to put it.
DOCTOR: Heavy. Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. School’s been quiet, it’s summer break. I've been walkin' a bit more, tryin' to get some exercise, but nothin' major. Oh! I did start a new tea, a herbal one. Could that… do somethin’? I don’t know much about teas, really.
DOCTOR: Herbal tea… unlikely, but we’ll note it. When did you notice the swelling starting?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... It started maybe four days ago? It was just a little bit bigger than usual, then it just kept gettin' bigger each day. I thought it might just go away on its own, but it hasn’t, so I thought I should come get it checked. I didn't want it to be somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No shortness of breath, no chest pain, and I haven’t been feelin’ dizzy at all. Just the leg, really. And bein’ a bit worried about it, naturally. It’s just… unnervin’ to see it gettin’ bigger.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's take a look. Could you sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just let me know if there's a good way to do this, I don’t want to cause any trouble. It's a bit high up.
DOCTOR: Use the stool if you need it. I’m going to examine your leg, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you! That's very kind of you. Alright, go ahead when you're ready. I will try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is definite edema, pitting edema to be precise. And your left leg is warmer than your right. No audible bruits. Heart rate is irregularly irregular, consistent with atrial fibrillation. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure 128/76, pulse ox 98% on room air. Alright. It appears you have worsening edema in your left leg, and your atrial fibrillation is likely contributing.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… concerning. Edema? And… is that bad? I'm sorry, I don’t really understand all the… words. What does that mean for my leg, and what can we do about it? The heart thing… is that gettin’ worse too? I’m a bit frightened now.
DOCTOR: Edema is simply swelling, due to fluid buildup. It's often related to poor circulation, which, in your case, is likely due to the irregular heartbeat. The irregular heartbeat – the atrial fibrillation – isn't necessarily worse, but it’s contributing to the fluid buildup in your leg. It’s… not ideal. We need to rule out a blood clot, which is a more serious concern. I’m going to order a D-dimer and a venous ultrasound to assess for deep vein thrombosis.
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That does sound serious. A D-dimer… and a… venous ultrasound? Will those be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I… I’m sorry to bother you with so many questions, I just… I don’t like bein’ unwell.
DOCTOR: The D-dimer is a simple blood test. It's not painful. The venous ultrasound involves a technician using a gel and a probe to look at the veins in your leg. It shouldn't be painful, though it can be slightly uncomfortable. Results usually take 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low-dose diuretic to help reduce the fluid buildup, and I want you to elevate your left leg whenever possible. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright, I suppose. Elevate it… I can do that. And 24 to 48 hours… that feels like a long time. No allergies to medications, not that I know of. I’ve never had to take many, thankfully. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, specific exercises, or things I should avoid? And… should I be worried about this while I’m waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: Avoid prolonged standing. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening leg pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. As for exercises… really, just try to keep it elevated. I wouldn't recommend strenuous activity at this point. I’ve ordered the necessary tests. We’ll review the results when they come back. Do you have any other questions… for now?
PATIENT: Oh… right. No chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening pain. I will remember that. I… I think that’s all for now, doctor. Thank you for… explainin’ things. And for the tests. I’m just… a bit anxious, naturally. But I’ll try to keep my leg elevated and not worry too much. Would it be alright if I asked the nurse where to go for those tests, when I leave?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse at the front desk can assist you. Have a good day. .
