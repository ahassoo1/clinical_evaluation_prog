DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Seil, is it? Yes, well, it's this…shaking. It's mostly in my hands, I think. Been getting worse lately. Honestly, I don't remember exactly when it started, but my daughter, she noticed it first and told me to come see someone. She worries too much, that one. But… yeah, the shaking. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your daughter encouraged you to come in; it’s always helpful to have someone notice changes in our health. The shaking in your hands – can you describe it to me a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… well, it’s not constant. It comes and goes. When I try to do something, like… button my shirt, or hold a cup of coffee, it gets worse. It's like a little tremor, you know? Not a big shake, but enough to spill things sometimes. And it seems to bother me more when I'm… tired, maybe? Or stressed. I don’t rightly remember. It’s hard to keep track of these things these days. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. A tremor that's worse with activity and possibly related to fatigue or stress. That’s helpful information. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if this tremor is only in your hands, or do you notice it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I think I feel a little bit of it in my leg sometimes. Just a slight wobble, really. Not as bad as the hands, though. And it doesn’t happen often. I mostly notice it when I'm trying to stand still for a long time. But honestly, I could be imagining things. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Jezik. Any changes you notice, even if you’re unsure about them, can be helpful. So, the tremor is primarily in your hands, but you've noticed some occasional slight wobbling in your leg as well. Could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I used to be pretty healthy, worked at the water treatment plant for… oh, I don't even know how long. Lots of walking, lots of physical work. But that was years ago. Now… I get tired easily. And my knees ache, especially in the cold. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I don’t really have a doctor, to be honest. Just… take a couple of pills for my blood pressure now and then, but I mostly just try to take it easy. I don't have insurance, you see. Makes it hard to bother with doctors much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you’ve been generally healthy in the past. And I appreciate you telling me about the tiredness and knee pain, and that you take medication for blood pressure. Do you recall the name of the blood pressure medication you take, and how often you take it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question. My daughter, she handles most of that for me now. She fills my pill organizer. I think… it's a white pill? Small, round? I take it… once a day, I believe. Maybe twice? I really couldn’t say for sure. Sorry, I’m not much help on that one. My mind just doesn’t hold onto those details anymore. It’s… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. It’s common to have difficulty remembering medication details. We can certainly figure that out. Before we move on, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. And… no, I don’t think so. Nothing I’ve ever reacted to badly. My daughter always asks me that, too, but I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I’m pretty sure, anyway. It’s… everything just feels a little fuzzy these days, you see. I apologize for being so vague. I just want to get this shaking figured out, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Mr. Jezik. It’s helpful to know you haven’t experienced any known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had similar shaking or movement problems, or any neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tough one. My parents, they both passed away a long time ago. And I didn’t really keep in touch with a lot of my relatives. I know my grandfather… he walked with a bit of a limp when he got older, but I don’t know if that’s the same thing as shaking. And… honestly, I don’t recall anyone else having trouble with that sort of thing. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… been a long time, and I don’t have a very good memory for those things. Is it important? Would it change things? I’m just trying to understand what you need to know.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Jezik. Family history can be helpful, but it’s not always definitive. We'll proceed without it for now. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Oh. Well… I don’t really go out much anymore. I live alone since the divorce… a long time ago. I used to enjoy fishing, but it’s hard to get around these days. Mostly I just stay home, watch TV, read the paper. I have my daughter visit sometimes, that’s nice. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer with dinner now and then. And I certainly don’t smoke. Quiet life, mostly. Is that what you wanted to know? It’s not very exciting, I’m afraid. I just... try to keep busy, I suppose. I'm getting tired now. Can we be almost done?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like you live a quiet and peaceful life, and that’s perfectly fine. Okay, Mr. Jezik, thank you for answering all of my questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you could. I’m not very good at sitting still for long, you see. And my knees… they ache. But yes, go ahead. I just want to know what’s causing this shaking. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to check your reflexes and coordination. Finally, I'm going to assess the tremor in your hands and legs. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
