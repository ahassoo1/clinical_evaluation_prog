DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about… a thing. A little… improvement, you understand. I don’t have all day for this, so if we could just get right to it… I need a paper signed so I can get this done. It’s… cosmetic. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic, you say. And you need me to sign off on it?
PATIENT: Isn’t that what doctors do? They sign papers. Look, I’m a working man. I install things. Radio towers, cell phone stuff… complicated business. This… this is just a little touch-up. I don’t need a whole examination. Just tell me what you need from me to sign the paper, alright? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, while it's true we sign paperwork, I have a professional obligation to understand why you need it signed. Simply stating it's "cosmetic" isn't sufficient. It could be something… more complicated than you realize. What exactly are you hoping to have done, and who is performing the procedure?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… This is ridiculous. It's a… a little smoothing. Some wrinkles. That's all. A fella down at… well, it’s a place. A beauty place. I don’t remember the name. It’s… new. They said I needed a doctor to say I’m… fit enough, I suppose. I don’t know, I just want this over with. Are you going to sign it or not? I haven’t got all day to explain my personal business.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but I need more information. "A little smoothing" could involve injections, lasers… any number of things. Without knowing the specifics, I can’t ethically sign off on a procedure. Do you recall anything about the name of this “beauty place”?
PATIENT: Look, it was… shiny. Lots of gold lettering, I think. And pictures of… young ladies. That’s all I remember. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not good with names. I fix antennas, I don’t socialize. They seemed reputable. They have all the… the equipment. Just sign the paper, please. I don’t even know why I have to explain this to a doctor. It's not like I'm having heart surgery!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, even with cosmetic procedures, there are risks. Allergic reactions, infections… things can go wrong. And I have a duty to ensure your safety. Do you have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Uh… no. Not that I know of. I work. I eat. I sleep. Sometimes my back aches from climbing those towers, but that’s just… work. I don’t go to doctors. What good does it do? They just tell you to stop doing what you’re doing. I need this signed. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Let’s try this another way. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Sometimes I take something for… indigestion. That pink stuff. And… occasionally, an aspirin for my head. But that’s it. Really. Just the pink stuff and the aspirin. Why do you need to know everything? This is getting ridiculous. I just want a signature.
DOCTOR: And when was the last time you had a full physical exam, Mr. Honcoop?
PATIENT: A physical? Oh, goodness, Doctor, I haven't had one of those in… decades. Probably when I was in the army. A long, long time ago. Look, are you going to sign the paper or am I wasting my time here? I have work to do. Towers don’t fix themselves, you know. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically sign this paperwork without a basic understanding of your health status. Given your age, lack of recent medical attention, and the potential risks associated with any procedure, I strongly recommend a full physical exam before proceeding. I'm concerned about potential underlying conditions. Until I can assess your health, I will not be signing this document. I can offer to schedule an appointment with one of my colleagues for a thorough evaluation. Would you be interested in that?
