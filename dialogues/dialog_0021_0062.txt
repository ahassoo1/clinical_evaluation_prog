DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate you seeing me. It’s about…well, it’s about the masks at work. I’m a Protective Service Worker, and it’s become…difficult. I need to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps some alternative arrangements. I’m not comfortable wearing them for extended periods.
DOCTOR: Masks, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's…it feels like they’re restricting my breathing, and honestly, it brings back some…uncomfortable memories. Not a panic, exactly, but a tightness in the chest. I’ve been trying to manage, but it’s impacting my ability to do my job effectively, and I worry about the people I serve if I’m distracted. I wouldn't want to put anyone at risk. I understand the importance of safety, of course. I just…need to explore other options.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable memories…right. And how long have you been feeling this way when wearing a mask?
PATIENT: It started when the requirements began, around…March of 2020, I believe. It wasn’t immediate, but with each mandate, it got a little worse. At first, I thought it was just…adjustment. But it hasn’t gotten better, Doctor. It's been ongoing, nearly six years now. It's not a constant thing, more like…waves. Some days are easier than others, but the anxiety is always there, building up the longer I have it on. Is that…helpful information? I’m not sure how much detail you need.
DOCTOR: Six years…that is a long time to be dealing with this. And you're a Protective Service Worker, so it's not like you can just…avoid people, right?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's correct. My work requires direct contact with families, often in their homes. It's…essential work, as they say. And I take pride in it. It’s just…becoming increasingly difficult to balance the safety protocols with my own…wellbeing. I’ve tried different types of masks, different techniques for breathing…nothing seems to fully alleviate the feeling. I’m hoping you might have some suggestions, or perhaps be able to document my situation for my employer.
DOCTOR: Documenting it is one thing, but I need to understand why you're experiencing this. Six years is a long time for a simple mask intolerance. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with any anxiety disorders, or…anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. No, I haven’t been formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I’ve always considered myself a fairly…stoic person. We Lakota Sioux tend to…keep things to ourselves, I suppose. But…looking back, there have been times of significant stress in my life, particularly surrounding my family’s history. My ancestors experienced…a great deal of trauma, and I’ve often felt a…weight, a responsibility to remember those experiences. Perhaps…it’s connected? I honestly don’t know. I’ve never really spoken to anyone about it. It just…feels like a tightening in my chest, a feeling of being…suffocated. More emotional than…clinical, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Emotional, right. And this…suffocating feeling, does it happen with anything else?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It’s…not frequent, but yes, it has happened with other things. Crowded spaces, for example. Or…situations where I feel…trapped. Not physically, necessarily, but…overwhelmed. Like I have no control. It's…hard to explain. It's not a full-blown panic attack, but a rising sense of unease, a feeling of being…closed in. We had a particularly difficult situation at work last year, a family reunification case…that brought it on pretty strongly. I had to excuse myself several times. It's usually short-lived, but…unpleasant. Does that…shed any light on it? I’m trying to be as thorough as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else going on. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and just generally see if there's anything obvious. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable, Doctor. Absolutely. I understand. Please, proceed. I want to be sure we’ve explored all possibilities. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit up here for me. First, I’m going to listen to your breathing, front and back. Take deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay. Sounds clear, but a little…shallow. Heart rate is a bit elevated, 82, but that could be from talking. Blood pressure is 138 over 88, also a little high, but again, not overly concerning right now. Do you feel any pain in your chest when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Not at all. Just…a slight discomfort, a tightness. It’s more of a…a pressure, really. I appreciate you being so thorough. It’s…reassuring. The shallow breathing…I think that’s just a habit. I tend to hold my breath when I’m anxious. It’s…difficult to control sometimes. I am relieved to hear there’s nothing obvious physically wrong. What are your thoughts, Doctor? Do you have any preliminary ideas?
DOCTOR: Preliminary thoughts…it sounds like we’re dealing with a significant anxiety component, likely exacerbated by past trauma and potentially triggering sensory overload. The mask is acting as a focal point for those feelings. It's not necessarily a physical issue, more…psychological. It's also not uncommon for people to develop sensitivities after prolonged stress. Now, I'm not a psychologist. What I can do is document your situation for your employer, explaining that you're experiencing anxiety symptoms related to mask use. However, I strongly recommend you consider seeing a therapist or counselor. They can help you develop coping mechanisms and address the underlying trauma. I can provide a referral if you’re interested. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: That…makes a great deal of sense, Doctor. It’s…a relief to hear someone acknowledge it’s not simply a…weakness, or an unwillingness to comply. A therapist…I’ve always been hesitant. We Lakota Sioux…we tend to handle things ourselves. But…perhaps it’s time. Yes, a referral would be…appreciated. Documenting it for my employer is essential, of course. It’s…difficult to explain this to them without some professional backing. And…thank you, Doctor. Truly. For listening, and for your understanding. It means more than you know.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. It takes courage to acknowledge these things, and even more to seek help. I'm happy to help in any way I can. I’ll write up a note for your employer detailing your anxiety symptoms related to mask use and recommending a temporary accommodation, if possible, while you explore therapy options. I’ll also provide you with a list of local therapists specializing in trauma-informed care. Here’s the list. I'll also fax the note to your employer directly, with a copy for your records. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. That’s…incredibly helpful. The note to my employer, the referral list…I truly appreciate your thoroughness and your…compassion. Thank you again. I feel…significantly better, knowing I have a plan of action. I’ll follow up with a therapist as soon as possible. And if I have any further questions, or concerns, I’ll be sure to contact your office. Thank you, Doctor Havird. Truly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
