DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Right, well… something about a check-up? For… work. I do… ushering, mostly. Ticket things. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. They said I needed clearance for… a performance, I think? A media thing? It was the boss, I believe. He handles all that. I just… show up and do what I’m told, these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A work clearance physical. Ushering, ticket taking… that’s good to know. And it was your employer who requested this?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The boss. Young man. Very organized. Keeps things moving. I… honestly don’t recall the name. It’s terrible, isn’t it? I used to have a good memory. But… well, time, I suppose. It slips away. Is this going to take long? I have… a little something planned later. Nothing important, just… a quiet afternoon.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible, Mr. Krahn. I understand wanting to get back to your afternoon. Before we get started, let's just go over a few things. First, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. I… I think it’s alright. For my age, anyway. I don’t get sick much. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I walk a lot, at work. Standing mostly. I eat… reasonably well, I suppose. Nothing fancy. No real complaints, but nothing to write home about either. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long while. Years, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… Let me think… There was something when I was younger. A fever, a bad one. Spent a week in bed, I think. But that was… decades ago. And… no surgeries. Definitely no surgeries. I remember being very afraid of hospitals, even then. It was my mother who… oh, never mind. It’s all very hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, fever when you were younger… And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my ex-wife, of course. We don’t… speak much anymore. No children. My parents… they’ve both passed away, a long time ago. I had a brother, but he moved to… I think it was Canada? We lost touch years ago. It’s just me, really. I don't have much family left.
DOCTOR: I see. And have any close relatives had any significant health problems – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… a tough one. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, towards the end. I remember that. Lots of doctors’ visits. And… my father, he had something… with his lungs. He smoked, you see. A lot. I can't really recall the details. It was a long time ago. I wasn’t very involved in their care, to be honest. I was… busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother, lung issues in your father, related to smoking. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never really been one for pills. I prefer… a cup of tea, if I’m feeling unwell. And lots of rest. That’s always helped me. I try to stay active, but… these days it's harder. My knees aren't what they used to be. But no pills, Doctor. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, insect stings?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I eat most things. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, at least not that I can remember. Bees sting, of course, but that's just… pain. Not an allergy. I don't think I’m allergic to anything, Doctor. Honestly. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I… I don’t particularly like being poked and prodded, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… try to be quick, if you would? Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will. Please sit back and relax. Take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Good. Any shortness of breath lately, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. Not really. Sometimes, after a long shift, I feel a little… winded. But that’s just from being on my feet all day. It passes quickly. Nothing to worry about. It's just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 88. We’ll keep an eye on that. Ears look clear. Throat is a little dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Pulse is regular, but a little fast at 82. Now, can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A little wobbly, I’m afraid. Knees, you know. They aren't what they used to be. What are you looking for? Is something wrong? I do get dizzy sometimes, but I thought it was just… low blood sugar.
DOCTOR: Just checking your balance and looking for any signs of dizziness. You seem a little unsteady, yes. And your blood pressure is a bit high. Now, could you try walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Careful now… one foot in front of the other. It’s… a bit difficult. I don’t have much balance anymore. I try to be careful at work, but… sometimes people rush past. I nearly fell last week, but I caught myself on a railing. This is… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright, please sit down. Your gait is a bit unsteady and your balance is diminished. Blood pressure is consistently elevated. We need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. I also want to check your thyroid levels. And I think it would be a good idea to get an EKG, just to make sure your heart is functioning properly.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. So… there is something wrong? I knew it. All those tests… it sounds complicated. Will it take long? I really didn’t expect all this. I just needed a clearance for work, you know? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Krahn. These tests are just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Your high blood pressure and unsteady gait warrant further investigation, that’s all. The tests will give us the information we need to determine the best course of action. The blood work will take a couple of days to process, and the EKG can be done here in the clinic today. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. For now, I'm going to refer you to a cardiologist for a consultation. They are the experts in heart health. It’s always best to get a specialist’s opinion.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? That sounds… serious. I haven’t seen a specialist in… decades. Is it something about my heart? I do feel a little… fluttery sometimes, but I thought it was just anxiety. What if… what if it’s something bad? I just wanted to get back to work, Doctor. I don’t want all this fuss.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you mentioned the fluttery feeling. That’s helpful information. The cardiologist will be able to assess your heart function and determine the cause of those sensations. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something serious wrong, but it’s important to rule out any potential problems. We’re being proactive here, Mr. Krahn. Early detection is key to managing any health concerns. The cardiologist will likely order some additional tests, such as an echocardiogram, but we’ll discuss all of that when we have the results. I'm going to print out the referral form and schedule an appointment for you with Dr. Lee. She’s a very good cardiologist, and she'll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and try to manage your stress levels. We’ll get this figured out, Mr. Krahn. Don’t worry. Here's the referral, and the appointment is scheduled for next Tuesday at 2 PM. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, I suppose so. It's all so much. A cardiologist, an echocardiogram… I just don't have the energy for all this. I feel… overwhelmed. Will I be able to work? I don't want to lose my job. It's not much, but it keeps me… occupied. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. It is a lot to take in. Let's focus on getting the tests done first, and then we'll assess the situation. As for work, let's discuss that with Dr. Lee. She can advise you on whether or not you need to take time off. I'll also have my nurse, Sarah, call you tomorrow to answer any questions you may have and help you schedule the echocardiogram. For now, try to rest and stay calm. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath. We’ll get through this together. I'm here to support you. Is there anyone you’d like me to contact, a family member or friend, to help with this?
