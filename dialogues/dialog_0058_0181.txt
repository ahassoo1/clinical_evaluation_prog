DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Todorovich. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be… proactive. I believe the paperwork outlined it, but I wanted to discuss the results with a professional.
DOCTOR: Proactive, yes. Good. Though, frankly, most people come in when something’s already wrong. Paperwork is… helpful, but it rarely tells the whole story. So, let's go through it anyway. You said general wellness… any specific concerns?
PATIENT: No, not specifically. Truly, Doctor, I feel quite well. Perhaps a little more tired than I used to be, but I attribute that to simply getting older. My wife, Elena, insists I'm imagining things, as she always does. But she worries, you see. I thought a comprehensive look at the numbers might ease her mind, if nothing else. Is that… unusual? To request this without a particular ailment?
DOCTOR: Not unusual, no. Though, often unnecessary. We have limited resources, you understand. But alright. A little more tired… how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been creeping up on me, I suppose, for… six months, maybe? It’s not debilitating, not at all. Just… I don't bounce back as quickly after a day of work. I still enjoy my construction work, you see. Keeps me moving. Elena says I overdo it, always have. She’s a practical woman, my Elena. Very practical. But this tiredness… it’s just a slight change, that’s all. Not enough to stop me, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Construction work… at 74?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve been building things my entire life. Started with my father in Venezuela, then here in the States. It's not glamorous work, but it’s honest. And it keeps me strong, mostly. We mostly do renovations, smaller projects these days. Nothing like the skyscrapers I used to work on. Though, honestly, I prefer the detail work. More satisfying, you know? Keeps the mind sharp. And Elena… she says I’d just sit and worry if I wasn’t keeping busy. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's get some baseline information. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No changes to speak of, Doctor. My appetite is… normal, I suppose. Elena cooks wonderful meals, so I never lack for food! And my weight has been fairly steady. Perhaps a pound or two gained during the winter months, but nothing drastic. I weigh myself occasionally, just to be sure. I'm around 90 kilograms, give or take. I try to maintain a healthy weight, for my age. Elena is very diligent about that, too. Always reminding me about portion sizes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any problems with sleeping?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I sleep like a log, Doctor. Always have. Elena says I snore, of course, but I can't help that! It's just a habit, I suppose. I typically go to bed around ten, wake up around six. No trouble falling asleep, no trouble staying asleep. A solid eight hours, most nights. I attribute that to the physical work, keeps me well-tired, you see. Though, sometimes I wake up earlier than usual, just to enjoy the quiet before Elena gets up. She's an early riser, always has a list of things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any recent illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Let me see… Nothing major, Doctor. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, back in Venezuela. A fairly routine procedure, all things considered. And a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. No hospital stays beyond that. I've been remarkably healthy, all things considered. I take good care of myself, and I’m fortunate to have a good constitution. Elena always says I’m too stubborn to get sick, if that makes any sense. She claims I just power through everything.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril, Doctor. For my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. It seems to be working well enough. No other medications, vitamins, or supplements. Elena keeps suggesting I take something for my joints, but I refuse. I prefer to rely on good, honest work to keep things moving. She worries about arthritis, you see. But I feel alright, mostly. A little stiffness in the mornings, but nothing that can’t be worked out. Is that… sufficient information?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been stung by bees a few times while working outside, but nothing beyond the usual swelling and discomfort. No food allergies, no environmental allergies, no reactions to medications. I’m remarkably unburdened in that regard, thankfully. Elena says I’m a miracle of nature, but I suspect she’s just exaggerating. She has a flair for the dramatic, my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Mombrun. Given your age and the construction work, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Blood pressure and pulse are already in the chart. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your joints. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. I’ve always believed in being thorough, especially as one gets older. A good examination can’t hurt, and it will likely reassure Elena, which is always a bonus. Please, proceed at your leisure. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Let me know if I need to adjust my position or anything of the sort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me. And another. Good. Heart sounds regular, rate 78. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there's a slight wheeze on auscultation. Could be age-related. Reflexes are 2+ throughout. Patellar, biceps, triceps… all normal. Some mild crepitus in both knees, as expected. No significant swelling or tenderness. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly in the left knee. Alright. I'm noting some age-related changes, as expected. The wheezing is something we should monitor.
PATIENT: That doesn't surprise me, Doctor. I do feel a little stiffness in my knees, particularly after a long day. And I've always had a bit of a sensitive chest, though I've never given it much thought. Monitoring it sounds wise. Is it… something to be concerned about? Elena will likely want to know everything, you see. She’s very thorough when it comes to my health. She’ll want to know the specifics, the percentages, the potential implications… you understand.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything serious at this time, Mr. Mombrun. But given your age and the construction work, we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and some basic blood work. Just to get a baseline and ensure there’s no underlying inflammation or infection. Specifically, I want to check your white blood cell count, your kidney and liver function, and your inflammatory markers. It's a standard procedure. The X-ray will help rule out any lung issues. And the blood work will give us a better picture of your overall health. It's precautionary. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Precautionary measures are always wise, particularly at my age. Elena will be relieved to hear that you’re being thorough. She often worries unnecessarily, but it's better to be safe than sorry, as she always says. White blood cell count, kidney and liver function, inflammatory markers… and a chest X-ray. I’ll make an appointment for those tests immediately. Where should I go? And is there anything I should avoid doing beforehand? Any dietary restrictions, or should I refrain from strenuous activity? I want to ensure the results are as accurate as possible. And please, let me know when I can expect the results. Elena is quite impatient, you see. She’ll be expecting an update as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You can get the blood work done at the lab across the street - here’s the requisition. And the X-ray can be done at Rural Imaging, just ten minutes down the road – here’s the referral. No dietary restrictions. Just try to relax beforehand. Avoid strenuous activity for the next 24 hours. And I’ll have the results sent to me within 48 to 72 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. And Mr. Mombrun, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever… Yes, I understand perfectly. I’ll avoid any strenuous activity and keep a close watch for those symptoms. Elena will be relieved to hear that you’ve given me clear instructions. She’s very particular about following medical advice. Thank you, Doctor Todorovich. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I’ll schedule the tests immediately and await your call. If you don’t mind, could you just confirm the clinic’s phone number? Elena likes to have everything written down, you see. It’s just her way of being prepared. And again, thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I feel much better knowing that we’re being proactive about my health.
DOCTOR: 555-123-4567. That’s all, Mr. Mombrun. I'll be in touch once the results are available. If you have any questions before then, you can contact the clinic. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and expertise.
