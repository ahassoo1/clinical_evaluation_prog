DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been giving me trouble. And dizziness, sometimes. It comes and goes, you know? It's hard to explain exactly… it’s been happening for a little while now. My daughter, Lani, she helped me make the appointment. She was worried. I… I don't always remember things clearly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Ears and dizziness. Okay. “A little while now” is rather vague, Ms. Mayhugh. Could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… specific. Hmm… let me think. It’s been… maybe six months? Or was it closer to a year? It started after… after my husband, Jone, passed away. Everything felt a bit… off then. It’s hard to say when exactly the ears started, but it feels like it was around then. Sorry, I wish I could be more help. My memory just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that things are difficult after a loss, Ms. Mayhugh. We’ll work through this. So, the ear issues and dizziness began roughly six months to a year ago, coinciding with your husband’s passing. Can you describe what the trouble with your ears feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it's like things get muffled, sometimes. Like someone turned the volume down. And other times… it’s just a ringing. A high-pitched ringing. It comes and goes, like you said. And then the dizziness… it's not like spinning, exactly. More like… everything feels unsteady. Like I'm on a boat, maybe? It doesn't last long, usually. Just a few minutes, then it’s gone. But it’s… unsettling, you know? Makes me feel a bit shaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing, ringing in the ears – tinnitus, we call it – and a sensation of unsteadiness, not spinning, lasting a few minutes at a time. Have you noticed any connection between these symptoms and anything specific?
PATIENT: A connection? Hmm… Not really, no. It doesn't seem to happen after anything in particular. Sometimes it happens when I'm resting, sometimes when I'm out shopping. It’s just… random, I think. Lani said something about it maybe being stress? But I’m not sure. I’ve always been a bit… calm, usually. It’s just been harder since Jone… everything's been harder. Sorry. I'm probably not making much sense.
DOCTOR: You're making perfect sense, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s quite common for symptoms to appear or worsen during periods of stress or grief. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any pain in your ears, or any discharge from them?
PATIENT: No, no pain. And no discharge, either. Just the muffled hearing and the ringing. And the dizziness, of course. It's just… a bothersome feeling, more than anything. It doesn't hurt, you know? It just makes things… difficult. It's hard to hear people sometimes, especially in noisy places. And I worry about falling when I get dizzy. That’s the worst part, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain or discharge, just the muffled hearing, tinnitus, and intermittent dizziness. Have you ever had any problems with your balance before this, or any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh, goodness. When I was a little girl, maybe? I remember being sick sometimes, but I don’t really remember having ear infections specifically. It was a long time ago. And no problems with my balance before this, no. I used to walk everywhere, even up the hills. I'm a Fijian woman, you know? We're usually pretty sturdy. It’s just… lately things feel a bit unsteady, like I said.
DOCTOR: Right. No recall of prior ear infections, and no previous balance issues. Now, I'm going to ask about some other things, just to get a full picture. Have you noticed any headaches, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. But not bad ones, you know? Just a little bit of a dull ache sometimes. Nothing I usually bother with. And no, no changes in my vision. Everything looks pretty much the same as always. I wear reading glasses, of course, but I've had those for years. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but that’s just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Occasional mild headaches, no vision changes. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Just the blood pressure pills, Doctor. The little white ones. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re acting up. But that’s just when they’re really sore. Lani helps me keep track of everything. She’s very good at that. I don’t remember the names of them, I’m afraid. It all gets mixed up in my head. And, well, I take Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, occasional medication for your knees, and Medicare coverage. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had any allergic reactions. I eat pretty much everything, except maybe too much sugar, Lani says. But that’s not an allergy, is it? I haven’t had any trouble with medications either. I’ve taken pills before, for colds and things like that. No reactions. Just… old age, I think. Everything feels a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I’m going to do a quick examination of your ears, just to take a closer look. I’ll also check your balance and your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, please? My ears are a bit sensitive. And I get a little nervous when people get too close to my head. It’s silly, I know. But… well, you know. It’s been a long day already.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh. Your ear canals are a little narrow, which makes it harder to get a good look, but I don't see any signs of infection or fluid buildup. Your eardrums look intact, though a bit dull in color. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. And your balance… it's a little unsteady, but not dramatically so. It appears you have some diminished proprioception. I’m noting all this. Do you often feel off balance, or is it only when you’re experiencing dizziness?
PATIENT: Diminished… what now? Proprio… oh dear. Only when I’m dizzy, usually. But sometimes, even when I’m not feeling dizzy, I feel a little… wobbly. Like I might fall. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a spinning feeling, just… unsteady. And yes, the blood pressure being high doesn't surprise me. Lani keeps telling me to watch my salt intake, but… well, I like a bit of flavour in my food. It’s just… getting old, Doctor. Everything feels a bit off these days. Is that what you think?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily just getting old, Ms. Mayhugh. While age can contribute to some of these symptoms, the combination of muffled hearing, tinnitus, dizziness, and slight balance issues could indicate a few different possibilities. Given your history, and the fact that your symptoms started around the time of your husband’s passing, it's important to consider the possibility of Meniere’s disease, although we need further testing to confirm. It's also possible this is related to an inner ear infection that is resolving, or even age related degeneration of your inner ear. The diminished proprioception may be from an underlying neuropathy. To rule things out, I want to order a hearing test – an audiogram – to assess the extent of your hearing loss. I also recommend a blood test to check for any underlying conditions, and possibly an MRI of the brain to rule out any other potential causes for your dizziness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… so many tests! Meniere’s… what is that? And an MRI… is that safe? It sounds… frightening. I don't like the sound of all these things, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? I don't want to be poked and prodded and have things done that I don't understand. Is it… is it something serious? And will it take a long time? I have a bingo night next week, you see…. I don't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests. Meniere’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can cause episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. It's not usually life-threatening, but it can be disruptive. The MRI is very safe; it uses magnetic waves, not radiation. You’ll lie still on a table for about 30-45 minutes, and it won’t hurt. The tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms so we can develop a proper treatment plan. It's better to know what we're dealing with rather than just guessing. As for the bingo night, we can schedule the tests around your commitments. The tests won’t interfere with that. I will also write you a prescription for meclizine, which is an anti-vertigo medication that can help with your dizziness in the meantime. We can also discuss some dietary changes that may help, such as reducing your salt intake and avoiding caffeine. Would you like me to explain this to Lani as well?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you, Doctor. Yes, please, if you could explain it to Lani, that would be wonderful. She understands these things much better than I do. And meclizine… is that a strong pill? I don't like taking too many medications. And I do love my salt, you see. But if it helps, I suppose I can try. It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming at the moment. Can I at least try the meclizine and see if that helps before we go through all these tests? I really don’t want to miss bingo… Maybe if the dizziness gets better, we won't need the tests? It might just be stress, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. We can try the meclizine first. It's a relatively mild medication, and it often helps with dizziness. I will write you a prescription for a low dose. However, if your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, it's crucial that you contact my office to schedule the hearing test and MRI. The tests are important to rule out anything serious. I don’t want to dismiss anything. I also want you to see a neurologist. I’ll refer you to Dr. Sharma; she’s excellent. A neurologist can help determine if there's any underlying neurological cause for your symptoms. I will have my nurse explain the medication instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as severe headaches, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Meclizine, see Dr. Sharma, and follow up in two weeks. And emergency room if things get worse. It’s just… a lot to remember. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I really appreciate it. I'll call Lani and let her know. Maybe she can help me keep track of everything… Do you think... do you think this could be something to do with Jone passing? I just keep feeling… off, like something isn't right.
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible, Ms. Mayhugh. Grief can manifest in many ways, both physical and emotional. It’s not uncommon to experience symptoms like dizziness and fatigue after a significant loss. We’ll investigate all possibilities. Please, don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help.
