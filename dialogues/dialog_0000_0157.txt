DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't even know why I need to be here. It's just a number, right? My husband said I should get it checked, but I feel fine.
DOCTOR: “Just a number,” you say?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. He makes a big deal out of everything. Always worrying. He read something online, I guess. I don’t see what the fuss is about. I haven't changed anything about my life. Still working, still taking care of the house.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even if you feel fine, consistently elevated blood pressure—that "number" as you call it—can cause serious problems down the line. It's not just about feeling sick, it’s about preventing future issues. Let’s get a better understanding of what’s going on, shall we?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time. I have things to do. Is it going to involve needles? Because I really don’t like needles. And I already told you, I feel perfectly normal. What kind of “future issues” are you even talking about?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your concerns and your time is valuable. We might need a blood draw, yes, but let’s start with some questions first. We need to understand your history, lifestyle… things that could contribute to high blood pressure. “Future issues” can include heart problems, stroke, kidney damage... things we want to avoid. Now, let’s begin. First, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is… new. Like I said, my husband just insisted. He’s always reading scary stuff on the internet. He probably thinks I’m going to fall over dead any minute. Is that what you're going to tell me? I'm perfectly healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No previous diagnosis. And your husband is…concerned. Good. It’s good to have someone looking out for you, even if they are a bit dramatic. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do either of your parents, siblings, or grandparents have high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: My grandmother, on my mother's side, had something with her heart. But she lived to be ninety-two, so it couldn't have been that bad. And my uncle, the one who lives in Flagstaff, he had a stroke a few years ago, but he smoked like a chimney his whole life. It wasn't like me. I don't do any of that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Grandmother with heart issues, uncle with stroke and a smoking history. That’s good information. Now, what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: What do you mean? I have a lifestyle. I work, I keep the house clean, I make dinner… It’s not like I’m sitting around doing nothing all day. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: I’m trying to get a complete picture, Ms. Dudney. When you’re not working and taking care of the house, what do you do for yourself?
PATIENT: For myself? What kind of question is that? I don't really…do things. My husband and I watch TV sometimes. I used to go to powwows with my mother, but she passed last year. It's just… different now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss is difficult. And that's perfectly alright. Let's talk about your diet and exercise. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I usually have coffee and toast for breakfast. Lunch is usually a sandwich at work. And dinner… my husband usually cooks. It’s mostly meat and potatoes, sometimes frybread on the weekends. We like comfort food. Not fancy, but it’s filling. I don't really snack much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Meat and potatoes, frybread on weekends. And do you get much physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity? Not really. Work keeps me on my feet, but that’s about it. I don’t go to the gym or anything. I just… don’t have the time, or the energy, honestly. Is this almost over? I have to pick up my prescription later.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's check your blood pressure now, just to get a baseline. Then we can decide if any further testing is needed. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I still think this is a waste of my time. And don't expect me to be thrilled if you tell me I need to change my whole life.
DOCTOR: 162 over 98. Hmm. That is elevated. And I’m hearing some faint crackles in your lungs. Let’s listen to your heart more closely. Decreased breath sounds on the left lower lobe. Ms. Dudney, this isn't just a number. We need to investigate this further. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. And I'm going to need a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It's possible this is related to something more serious than just simple hypertension.
PATIENT: See? I knew it. This is exactly what I was afraid of. More tests, more poking and prodding. I don't like this one bit. Look, I need to think about this. And talk to my husband. I'm not comfortable doing all of this right now. I’ll… I’ll schedule something later. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, please. Before you leave, I need to strongly advise you against delaying this further. The crackles in your lungs, combined with your elevated blood pressure, could indicate pneumonia or even early congestive heart failure. We need to rule those things out immediately. I understand you're hesitant, but your health is at stake. I will personally call you to discuss the results as soon as they are available and explain everything in detail. I strongly recommend you go to the nearest emergency room if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness before I can reach you. Do you understand?
