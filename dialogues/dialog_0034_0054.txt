DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… cough. Yeah, I got cough. Long time already. And… tired. Very tired, sometimes. And my nose… always stuffy, then runny. Happens a lot. I think. I forget sometimes when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy, then runny nose. You mentioned it’s been going on for a while, and you're having some trouble remembering exactly when it began. That’s alright; we’ll try to piece things together. When you say “long time,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… six months? Or more? I work a lot, you see. Changing tires, fixing flats… dusty work. Maybe started when the weather got hot? I dunno. Everything feels blurry, honestly. I just know I feel tired all the time and I keep coughing. It’s… annoying. And I have to blow my nose a lot. My wife… she gets annoyed too.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly six months, possibly coinciding with warmer weather. And your work involves a lot of dust. That’s helpful information. Could you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… wet cough, sometimes. Like got phlegm. Other times, it’s dry, makes my throat sore. Mostly in the morning, when I wake up. And when I move around a lot at work, lifting tires, you know? It makes it worse. Does that… make sense? I don’t know the right words.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A wet cough with phlegm sometimes, and a dry cough that causes a sore throat. Worse in the mornings and with activity. We’re getting a good picture here. Is the phlegm any particular color?
PATIENT: Color…? Uh… sometimes white? And… other times… yellow? Maybe a bit green sometimes. I don’t really look at it, if you know what I mean. Just… spit it out. Sorry. My wife says I should be more careful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Tati. That’s perfectly alright. White, yellow, and sometimes green phlegm. That’s useful information. Now, regarding your fatigue, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. Just… tired all the time. Even after sleep. Like… heavy. Can't really focus. Hard to do my work. Lifting tires… harder now. Used to be no problem. Now… I need to rest more often. And… I get dizzy sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah. My wife worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue even after sleep, difficulty focusing, increased effort with lifting, and dizziness. It's good your wife has noticed. When you say dizziness, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Like… everything spin. Not always. When I stand up too fast, sometimes. Or… when I bend down and pick something up. Just for a few seconds. Then it goes away. Not every time, though. It’s… weird. I haven't told the doctor before. Never really bothered me too much until now. Now… I’m just tired of being tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness related to standing up quickly or bending over. That’s important to know. And I understand your frustration with being tired. Before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask about a few other things. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever…? I dunno. I don't take my temperature. Chills… not really. Sometimes feel cold, but that’s usually when the air conditioning is too strong. Night sweats… um… maybe? I sleep with the fan on, so I sweat a little sometimes. But I dunno if it's more than usual. My wife… she says I toss and turn a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever that you're aware of, no significant chills, and possible night sweats, but potentially related to the fan and restless sleep. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, such as asthma, allergies, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. Never really been to the doctor much. Just for work injuries, you know? Like… sprains, cuts… nothing serious. My wife… she's healthy. Always tells me to go to the doctor, but… I work, I sleep, I repeat. No asthma. No allergies that I know of. Just… tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, mostly work-related injuries. That's helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Um… no. Never had any surgeries. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a baby? I don’t know. My mother… she passed away a long time ago. My wife… she doesn't know either. Nothing recent, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My mother… she had… something with her stomach, I think. But I don’t really remember. She passed away when I was young. My father… he was healthy, I think. Always worked hard. No heart problems, no diabetes that I know of. My wife says her grandfather had… high blood pressure, maybe? It’s all a bit blurry. We don't really talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible stomach issues in your mother, and high blood pressure in your wife's grandfather. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about some social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking. Never liked it. Alcohol… sometimes, with my wife, on special occasions. Not much. Maybe one or two beers. No… no drugs. Never. I work too hard for that. I need to be sharp for my job, you see? Can't be messing around with those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Uh… no. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. My wife… she's careful about what she eats, but I never had any problems. Once, when I was a kid, I got a rash from a plant, but that's it. No medication allergies, that I know of. I haven't taken much medication in my life. Just pain relievers for work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati, that’s very helpful information. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and temperature, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… get me back to work, please? I got tires to fix. But yeah, go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. I'll need to put this cuff around your arm. It'll squeeze for a moment, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Your ears look clear, but your throat is a little red and inflamed. Your lymph nodes are slightly swollen. Okay, Mr. Tati, based on the physical exam, your blood pressure is elevated, you have some mild wheezing in your lungs, your throat is red, and your lymph nodes are slightly swollen. These findings could be due to a number of things, including an infection or allergies. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and… X-ray? Uh… is it serious, Doctor? What’s wrong? I just got a cough, that’s all. I don't want to be sick. I got work to do. I don’t like hospitals. And… expensive, right? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. It's good you're asking questions. I don’t want to alarm you, and it doesn’t necessarily mean something serious is wrong. The blood work will help us to identify if there is an infection or inflammation in your body, and the chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs to see if there's any fluid or other abnormalities. I am aware you don't have insurance, and I'll do my best to keep the costs as low as possible. We can discuss payment options and potentially explore resources for low-cost testing. Before we proceed, could you tell me if you've had a fever at all, even a low-grade one?
PATIENT: Fever…? Uh… sometimes I feel warm, but I don't check my temperature. My wife… she says I feel warm sometimes, especially at night. But I thought it was just the weather, or the fan. Never really felt sick sick, you know? Just tired. And coughing. A little dizzy. But no… no high fever, I don’t think. I just assumed it was… work. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, no high fever, just feeling warm occasionally. That's helpful to know. Considering your symptoms – the cough, fatigue, wheezing, and slightly swollen lymph nodes – and the absence of a high fever, a few possibilities come to mind. It could be an upper respiratory infection like bronchitis, or potentially an allergic reaction, though the wheezing is more suggestive of an infection. To rule out anything more serious, such as pneumonia, and to get a clear diagnosis, I still recommend the blood work and chest X-ray. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Pneumonia…? Look, Doctor… I really don’t want to do all these tests. It sounds expensive, and I'm worried about what they might find. Can’t you just… give me something for the cough? Some medicine? I need to work, you know? I got bills to pay. Maybe it’s just a bad cold?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati, and I respect your wishes. I wouldn’t recommend tests unnecessarily. However, without knowing the cause of your symptoms, it's difficult to provide the most effective treatment. Simply treating the cough without knowing why you're coughing could mask a more serious underlying condition. While I can prescribe something for your cough symptoms, I strongly advise against it without further investigation. It could delay a proper diagnosis and potentially lead to complications. If you're absolutely opposed to the tests at this time, we can try a course of supportive care – rest, fluids, and an over-the-counter cough suppressant. However, I need you to understand that if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Before we proceed with either option, I want to be clear: I cannot definitively diagnose or treat your condition without further investigation. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits of both options – proceeding with the tests versus trying supportive care – in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Supportive care… that means just rest and cough medicine? No tests? And if it gets worse, I come back? And then you will do the tests? And how much will it cost to come back if it gets worse? I really… I just want to be able to work. My wife… she's worried about the bills. Is the cough medicine expensive? Just tell me what it will cost, Doctor. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, supportive care means rest, fluids, and an over-the-counter cough suppressant. If your symptoms worsen – meaning you develop a fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or if the cough doesn't improve after a week – you need to come back immediately, and then we will proceed with the tests. The cost of the visit to come back would be the standard office visit fee, which is $75, plus the cost of the tests, which can vary. The chest X-ray typically costs around $150 to $200, and the blood work can be around $50 to $100, depending on the tests we order. The cough medicine is relatively inexpensive. A typical over-the-counter suppressant like dextromethorphan or guaifenesin would cost around $10 to $20. I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Tati, and I want to be as transparent as possible. While I cannot guarantee the results, I can assure you that I will do my best to provide the most effective treatment within your means. So, if you choose supportive care, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking an over-the-counter cough suppressant as needed. If your symptoms worsen, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… $75 for the visit, $150-200 for the X-ray, $50-100 for the blood work… and $10-20 for the cough medicine. Okay. I think… I think I'll try the supportive care first. I really don’t want to spend all that money. I got bills to pay. Can you write me a prescription for the cough medicine? Just something to help me sleep at night. And… how often should I take it? And what if it doesn’t help?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tati. I’m prescribing you dextromethorphan 30mg, which is a cough suppressant that can help you sleep at night. You can take it every 4-6 hours as needed, but do not exceed 120mg in 24 hours. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. If the dextromethorphan doesn’t help, or if your symptoms worsen, please come back immediately. We can then discuss other options, including proceeding with the tests. I also recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Avoid smoking or being around smoke, and try to stay hydrated. Here is the prescription. You can take it to any pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope it helps. I really need to get back to work. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I hope you feel better soon. Remember, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please come back immediately. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and take care. Have a good day. .
