DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It's this itching, really. Just… all over. It started a few weeks back, and it hasn't gone away. It's driving me a bit crazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, all-over itching for a few weeks. That does sound frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not… like a rash, exactly. My skin looks normal, mostly. Sometimes it’s a little red after I scratch, but that’s from the scratching, I think. It’s just… an itch under the skin, if that makes sense? It’s worse at night, usually. And warm showers seem to make it worse too, which is… not ideal, living where we do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no visible rash, just the sensation of itching under the skin, worse at night and with warm showers. That’s helpful. And you said it started a few weeks ago – has anything changed in your life around that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. I lost my wife, bless her, about six months ago. That was a big change, obviously, but the itching didn’t start 'til after that, a good couple months after. I haven't started any new soaps or detergents, or anything like that. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. I did start taking a new vitamin, a multi-vitamin, about a month ago… but I don’t see how that would cause this. It's a brand my friend recommended, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significant life change six months ago, new multi-vitamin a month ago… we'll definitely keep those in mind. And just to clarify, is the itching all over your entire body, or are there specific areas that are worse?
PATIENT: It’s pretty much everywhere, but my back is the worst. I can never reach to scratch it properly, which is… infuriating. And my legs get really bad at night. My arms are okay-ish, mostly. Not terrible, just… present. It’s hard to describe. Like a constant… prickling, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worst on the back and legs, constant prickling sensation. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sleep okay, though I do wake up scratching sometimes, like I said. No fever, no weight loss, no… I don’t know, strange spots or anything like that. Just the itching. And a bit of frustration, I suppose. It's making me a bit restless, constantly thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, weight loss, or other skin changes. Just the itching and restlessness. Let's take a look at your skin. If you don’t mind, could you take your shirt off so I can get a better look, particularly at your back?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. It's not much to look at, I assure you. Just normal, slightly old skin. Just let me know if you need me to turn or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean – skin looks generally normal. No visible rash or lesions. I do see a few small scratch marks, consistent with your description. Skin appears dry. Let me palpate your skin. Nothing particularly concerning there either. Skin feels normal to the touch. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Sounds clear.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. It's good to hear everything sounds clear, at least. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly. It’s just… it's been driving me up the wall, and I was worried it was something serious. Dry skin… well, living in the country, things are dry most of the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good we're ruling things out. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like we're likely dealing with pruritus – generalized itching. Several things can cause it, and often it’s multifactorial. Dry skin certainly contributes, especially with our climate. The new multi-vitamin is something to consider – sometimes people can have reactions to ingredients. And, it's important to acknowledge the significant life change you experienced six months ago. Grief and stress can absolutely manifest physically, including causing skin symptoms. To start, I'd like to recommend a good emollient, a thick moisturizer, to be applied several times a day, especially after showering. We can also temporarily discontinue the multi-vitamin to see if that makes a difference. I’m going to order a complete blood count, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And, given the timing, it might be helpful to discuss your grief with a therapist or counselor. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: That… that all makes a lot of sense, actually. I hadn’t really thought about the grief manifesting physically, but… well, it’s been a hard six months. Stopping the vitamin sounds easy enough. And a good moisturizer… I suppose I have been neglecting that a bit. A referral to a counselor… yes, I think that would be good. I’ve been… trying to keep busy, but it's not always helping. It wouldn’t hurt to talk to someone, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. That feels… like a good starting point.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. It takes courage to acknowledge these things, and I'm glad we're able to talk about it. Okay, I'm ordering the CBC now, and I'll write you a referral to a grief counselor. I'm also printing out some information on moisturizers suitable for dry skin. We'll check the CBC results in a few days. If the itching doesn’t improve with the moisturizer and stopping the multi-vitamin, or if it gets worse, please call the office, and we can consider other possibilities. In rare cases, itching can be a sign of something more serious, so it’s important to keep an eye on it. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. It’s good to have a plan, and to know we're not just… guessing. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and not just brush it off as an old man complaining about an itch.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. It’s my job to listen, and I’m glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
