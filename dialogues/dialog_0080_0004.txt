DOCTOR: Hi Teah, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Rosanova, it’s good to meet you too. Just in for a check-up, mostly. They said it was time for some… you know, the shots to keep everything up to date. Routine stuff, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Routine check-ups are always a good idea. And yes, we'll definitely make sure your vaccinations are current. I see here you haven't been in for a while… about five years, is that right?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, has it been that long? Time really does fly. I think so, yeah. Things just get busy, you know? Work keeps me hopping. I do construction inspections, so I’m always out and about. Not a lot of time to think about doctor visits, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand completely. Construction inspections – that sounds demanding. Before we get to the shots, let’s just do a quick run-through of how you’ve been feeling overall. Any new aches, pains, or changes in your health since your last visit?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No major aches or pains, not really. I get a little stiff sometimes after being on my feet all day, but that’s just part of the job, I guess. Nothing I haven’t been dealing with for years. Maybe a little more tired than usual this summer, but honestly, it’s been so hot! I don’t know if that’s a health thing or just the weather. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And yes, the heat can definitely make you feel more fatigued. Let’s explore that tiredness a little more. How would you rate your energy levels on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being completely exhausted and 10 being full of energy?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good way to put it. Hmm… I’d say maybe a 6? On a good day. Some days it’s more like a 5, especially if it’s really hot and humid. It doesn’t really stop me from working, but I definitely don’t have the pep I used to. I just figured it was getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6, dropping to a 5 on hot days. That’s helpful. And it's good you’re still able to work, but we want to figure out why your energy is lower than it used to be. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes – like weight loss or gain, changes in your appetite, sleep problems, or feeling more stressed or anxious?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have lost a little weight, maybe five or ten pounds? It wasn’t on purpose, just haven't been as hungry lately. And I’ve been sleeping okay, but I do wake up a few times during the night. Nothing terrible, just… restless, you know? Stress… yeah, work can be stressful sometimes. Dealing with contractors and making sure everything’s up to code… it adds up. But I don't think it's anything major stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unintentional weight loss, restless sleep, and some stress from work. Let’s talk about your appetite a bit more. Has that changed recently – are you eating less than usual, or is it just that you don’t feel as hungry?
PATIENT: It’s definitely that I don’t feel as hungry. I used to have a pretty big appetite, and now… I just don’t crave food like I used to. I still eat when I need to, but I don’t go looking for snacks or anything. It's kinda weird, actually. I haven't really thought much about it until you asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good information. And it’s good you’re noticing these changes. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any fever, night sweats, or any new lumps or bumps anywhere on your body?
PATIENT: No fever, no night sweats. And no lumps or bumps that I’ve noticed. I do a pretty good self-check when I shower, you know, just to make sure everything’s okay. Everything feels normal there. I haven't had any new coughs or anything like that either. Really, just the tiredness and not being as hungry. It doesn't sound like much when I say it all out loud, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like much, but it’s important to investigate these changes, even small ones. Alright Teah, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Go right ahead. I'm happy to get checked out. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in and out, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear. Now I’m just going to check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. Next, I’ll check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal as well. Finally, I'll take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72. That's all within a normal range. Now, let me document these findings... I'm noting: clear lungs, regular heart, normal lymph nodes and thyroid, blood pressure 128/78, pulse 72.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good to me. Everything feels normal, so that’s reassuring. What do you think it could be? Are we thinking maybe a vitamin deficiency or something? I try to eat pretty healthy, but you never know.
DOCTOR: It’s good that everything feels normal and the exam didn’t reveal anything concerning. A vitamin deficiency is certainly a possibility, and it’s something we should investigate. However, the weight loss and decreased appetite, along with the fatigue, could be due to a number of things. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. It will check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a lot more information. Does that sound okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Blood work is a good idea. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not something serious. Will I need to fast beforehand? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. I’ll give you a lab requisition with detailed instructions. They’re located just down the hall, and you don’t need an appointment. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the follow-up?
PATIENT: Okay, 8 hours. Water is okay, good. I can definitely manage that. No, I think I understand everything. Just go to the lab, get the blood drawn, and then schedule a follow-up. Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. You’ve been very helpful. Should I also get those vaccinations done today, or wait until after the blood work?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. I'm glad I could help. Let’s go ahead and get your vaccinations done today. They shouldn’t be affected by the blood work, and it's good to get them up to date right away. We’ll do the influenza and tetanus booster. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Get it all done in one go. I always dread the flu shot, but it's better to just get it over with, I suppose. Let’s do it!
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s head over to the vaccination area, then. Nurse Emily will be right with us. She’s very gentle and efficient.
PATIENT: Sounds good. Nurse Emily, huh? I’m ready when she is. Lead the way!
DOCTOR: Hi Emily, this is Teah. She's here for her influenza and tetanus booster. Emily will explain everything before she administers the shots. And then we'll be all set. Do you have any allergies to vaccines that you know of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had any problems with vaccines before, as far as I remember. Just a little sore afterwards sometimes, but nothing serious. I think my mom kept pretty good track of all that when I was a kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. She’s all good to go. Alright Teah, after the shots, it’s possible to experience some mild soreness at the injection site, or perhaps a low-grade fever. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with that. I’ll give you a handout with detailed aftercare instructions. Is there anything else I can address for you today, or are you all set?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Dr. Rosanova. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explaining everything so clearly. Let’s get these shots done, and hopefully, I’ll be good to go for another five years!
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Emily will start with the influenza shot. It will be a quick pinch, and then we’ll move on to the tetanus booster. Don’t hesitate to let us know if you feel any discomfort. We're here to help.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just a quick pinch, right? I can handle that. Let’s get it over with!
