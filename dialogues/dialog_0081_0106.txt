DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it’s about my foot. This sore, it just won’t heal. Been at it for weeks now, and frankly, I’ve seen better work from…well, never you mind who. It’s just…irritating. And painful, of course. Though I suppose you're supposed to figure that out.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, at least six weeks now. Maybe longer. Time sort of…blurs when you're dealing with incompetence. I keep putting cream on it, like the nurse said, but it's just…not doing anything. Honestly, I’ve always been one to take care of myself. I don't usually bother doctors unless it’s absolutely necessary. And this…this is becoming a nuisance. A real one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly on your foot is this sore located?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s on the bottom, right here. See? Right in the middle of the arch. It's not a big sore, mind you, but it's deep. And red. And, as I said, it doesn't seem to be getting any better. I try to avoid putting weight on it, of course, but it's difficult. Everything’s difficult at my age, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, my foot feels…warm sometimes. And a bit tingly. Not always, but enough to notice. And truthfully, I’ve been feeling more tired than usual lately. But at eighty-nine, one expects a bit of tiredness, don’t you think? It's probably just…old age. Still, the foot is the main problem. It’s a constant ache, even when I'm not walking. And it keeps me up at night. It’s terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of diabetes, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Oh, that. Yes, the doctor told me years ago. Type 2, I believe. It runs in the family. I try to watch my sugar, but it’s difficult with all the good fruit around. And I do enjoy a sweet treat now and then. It’s not like I’m stuffing myself with it, but…well, a little bit of enjoyment is important, wouldn't you say? They put me on pills for it, years ago. I think I still take them. I'll have to check. Honestly, keeping track of everything is a chore.
DOCTOR: Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Honestly, do you expect me to remember everything? It's a little white pill…no, maybe it’s a little yellow one. I have so many pills these days! It starts with an 'M', I think. Or maybe a 'B'. It’s just…one of those little pills the doctor gave me a long time ago. I get them refilled at the pharmacy, regularly. I suppose you could just ask them, instead of expecting me to be a walking pharmacy database. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly verify that with the pharmacy. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your foot, even minor ones, before this sore appeared?
PATIENT: Injury? No, not that I recall. I’m very careful, you know. I don’t go traipsing through jungles or anything. I might have…stubbed it on the furniture, perhaps? A little bump here or there. Nothing serious. I certainly didn’t go falling or anything dramatic like that. It just…appeared, one day. A small red spot, and then…this. It's really quite bothersome. And I blame the shoes, truthfully. These new ones aren’t nearly as comfortable as my old pair.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently experiencing any numbness or tingling in any other part of your body besides your foot?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…yes, actually. My hands have been a bit…prickly lately. Not all the time, but sometimes. Especially at night. It wakes me up, occasionally. And my feet…well, they feel a bit…distant, sometimes. Like they’re not quite mine. Though that could just be old age, you know. Everything feels a bit…distant at my age. It’s probably nothing. Just an old lady’s complaints.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to examine your foot, Ms. Cannington. And I'd also like to check your pulses and sensation in your feet and legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine it? Well, I suppose so. Though I expect it won’t be a pleasant experience. And don’t poke too hard, young man. I have delicate skin, you know. And do hurry up. I have things to do. Important things. Though, admittedly, most of them involve sitting. Still. Let's get this over with. Be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to gently feel around. Notice any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there! See? I told you it was painful. Don't press so hard! It's tender all over, really, but especially right in the middle of the arch. It feels…inflamed. And warm. Honestly, I don't understand what's taking so long. It's a sore foot, not a complicated operation. Are you sure you know what you're doing, young man?
DOCTOR: I’m noting some redness and warmth to the arch of your foot. There’s some tenderness upon palpation, as you’ve pointed out. I’m also checking your pulses… Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your right foot compared to your left. Now, I'm going to check sensation in your foot with this… Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Yes, I feel it. Barely. It’s…a tickle, really. Not very strong. Is that normal? It feels…distant, like I said before. Like touching something through a thick blanket. And do hurry up, young man. You're poking me with that thing for ages! Are you sure you're not trying to make it worse? Because it's starting to feel a bit…stingy.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm also checking your reflexes… Your reflexes are also diminished in your right leg compared to your left. Given your history of diabetes, diminished pulses, and reduced sensation and reflexes in your foot, and the fact that this sore isn’t healing…I’m concerned about the possibility of peripheral neuropathy and possible early signs of peripheral artery disease. It’s important we investigate this further.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Peripheral…what-now? Disease? Honestly, young man, you’re just throwing around fancy words to scare an old lady. I’ve lived eighty-nine years without any of these…diseases. It’s just a sore foot! A painful sore foot, granted, but still… I don’t need investigations. I need a cream that works. And perhaps some stronger pain medication. Honestly, I thought doctors were supposed to fix things, not invent new problems. This is ridiculous. I want a second opinion. And a different doctor. One who doesn’t use such frightening language.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your concerns. However, these symptoms do warrant further investigation. Ignoring them could lead to serious complications, including infection and even amputation. While I respect your desire for a second opinion, I strongly recommend we at least get some blood work done to check your blood sugar levels and assess your circulation. I can order a vascular ultrasound to look at the blood flow in your legs and feet. We should also rule out any underlying infection. I’m not trying to scare you, but I have a professional obligation to ensure your health and safety. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Amputation?! You’re trying to scare me now! Honestly, young man, that’s outrageous! I came in here for a sore foot, and now you’re talking about losing limbs? This is preposterous! Fine. Blood work. But only blood work. No fancy ultrasounds. And no talk of…amputations. Just check my sugar, see if it's too high, and give me a cream that will actually heal this foot. And if it doesn't work, then I'll consider…other options. But no promises. This is a terrible experience. A terrible experience indeed. And I still think you should find me a better cream. Immediately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I’ll order a comprehensive metabolic panel, including a blood glucose level, and a complete blood count. I will also order a vascular ultrasound to assess your circulation. I’ll write you a prescription for a topical antibiotic cream for the sore, and I will recommend a podiatrist for ongoing wound care. I strongly encourage you to keep your follow-up appointments. I have a nurse who will provide you with lab requisition forms and information on how to schedule an appointment with a podiatrist. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
