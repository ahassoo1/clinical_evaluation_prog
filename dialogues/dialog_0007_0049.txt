DOCTOR: Hi Betty, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my ears, I think. Things haven't been as clear as they used to be, you see? Not like they were… oh, goodness, when was that now? It's just getting harder to hear folks talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, harder to hear folks talk. That's a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a tricky one. Seems like it’s been… gradual, like. Not all at once, you understand? Maybe… a few years now? Or was it longer? I used to work in the shoe factory, lots of noise there, of course. Maybe that had something to do with it? I don't rightly recall. It’s hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over a few years, and you used to work in a shoe factory with a lot of noise. That’s helpful information. Do you notice it in certain situations more than others?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. When there’s a lot of… hubbub, you know? Like at the church social last month. Couldn't make heads or tails of what Mrs. Gable was saying, and she was right next to me! And the television… I have to have it up pretty loud, and even then, sometimes I miss things. Quiet conversations are alright, most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with background noise and you've noticed needing to increase the volume on the television. Have you experienced any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or any ear pain along with the difficulty hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing… now, that’s a thought. Sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, maybe? Not all the time, though. Mostly when it’s quiet. Dizziness… not really. And no pain, thank goodness. My ears don't hurt, just… don't work so well.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ringing, especially in quiet, but no dizziness or pain. That's good to know. Have you ever had any ear infections, or had any surgeries on your ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh, goodness, when I was a little girl, I think. A couple of times, maybe? Nothing serious, the doctor gave me some drops, I suppose. And surgeries… no, never had any surgeries on my ears. I've had a few operations over the years, but none on my ears, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no ear surgeries, and a history of a couple of ear infections as a child. Do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... just the usual things for my age, you know? A little something for my blood pressure, and a vitamin D tablet in the winter. I think that’s it. And allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor’s given me.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and vitamin D, no known allergies. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope, if that’s alright with you. It won’t hurt.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, that sounds fine. As long as it doesn’t hurt, I suppose. My ears are a bit sensitive, you know, but I'll try my best to sit still. Just let me know if you see anything… interesting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. I'm looking in your ears now. Everything looks fairly normal on the outside. I do see a bit of cerumen – that’s earwax – in both ears. It looks like there’s some impaction, meaning it’s built up a bit. And the tympanic membranes – that's your eardrums – are a little dull, which can be common with wax buildup. It could also be related to some fluid, but it’s hard to tell with the wax present. It doesn't seem like there's any sign of infection right now, but the wax buildup is likely contributing to your hearing difficulty.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is it? Well, I suppose that makes sense. I don’t usually poke around in my ears, you see. Never been one for that. So, the wax is making it hard to hear? What do we do about it then, Doctor? Can you get it out?
DOCTOR: Yes, the wax buildup is the most likely cause of your hearing difficulty. And yes, we can definitely get it out. There are a few ways to do it. We could try softening the wax with some drops for a few days and then gently flushing it out. Or, if it's particularly impacted, I can carefully remove it with special instruments. It’s usually pretty quick and painless. Given your age and the fact that you haven’t been cleaning your ears, I think starting with the softening drops would be the gentlest approach. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Softening drops… that sounds… less scary than poking around with instruments, I suppose. Yes, let’s try the drops first. As long as they’re not anything too… strong, you understand? I’ve got sensitive skin. How long do I have to use them for? And will it make my ears feel funny?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. We’ll use some over-the-counter cerumenolytic drops – that’s just a fancy word for earwax softener – with mineral oil. They’re very gentle. You’ll put a few drops in each ear twice a day for about five to seven days. It might feel a little strange at first – a slight fullness or bubbling sensation – but it shouldn’t be painful. After five to seven days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to check if the wax has softened enough to remove. If it hasn’t, we can discuss other options. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Five to seven days… twice a day… alright, I think I can manage that. Mineral oil, you say? That sounds… safe enough. Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I'll give those drops a try, and then we’ll see what happens at the follow-up. When can we schedule that for?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for August 9th at 2:00 PM. That will give the drops enough time to work. Does that time work for you, Betty?
PATIENT: August 9th… yes, that sounds alright. 2:00 PM is fine. I don't have anything planned then, I don't think. As long as I remember, that is.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I’ve got you scheduled for August 9th at 2:00 PM. I'll also give you a printed instruction sheet with how to use the ear drops, just in case you forget. Do you have any other questions for me today, Betty?
PATIENT: Oh, that's kind of you to print those instructions. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Hmm… let me think… No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I suppose I just need to remember to put the drops in twice a day. Thank you very much for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, if you experience any pain, dizziness, or drainage from your ears before your follow-up appointment, please call the office right away. Otherwise, just follow the instructions, and we'll check in on August 9th. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I will try to remember all that. And I will call if anything feels amiss. You have a good day too, and thank you again.
