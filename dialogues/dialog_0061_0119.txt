DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Jinnie! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. I suppose I should just get right to it. It’s a rather… delicate matter, and frankly, it’s quite embarrassing to have to discuss. But my friend, Esmeralda, she said I had to come in. It involves… a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. Not mine, of course. It’s… my companion's. He’s… not here, unfortunately. Too much shame, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. It is often difficult to talk about these things, and I appreciate you coming in. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. So, this discharge is from your companion – is he a pet, or… could you tell me a little more about who he is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. A pet? Really, Doctor. That's… rather presumptuous. He is a… a gentleman friend. We’ve been… companions for quite some time. And a very respectable one, I assure you. Though, presently, he's... indisposed. And embarrassed. That's why I'm here, to handle the unpleasantness. It's not something one boasts about, you understand. A gentleman simply doesn't discuss these things.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course! My apologies, Jinnie. That was a very insensitive assumption on my part. Please forgive me. It’s good you’re looking out for him. Now, can you tell me a bit more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… yellowish, mostly. And rather… thick. Not watery, thankfully. It started about a week ago, I'd say. He noticed it after… well, after our activities. He's quite meticulous, you see, so he’s very aware of these things. And it… smells. Not a pleasant smell, I assure you. It’s not constant, thankfully, but it’s definitely there. He’s also been a bit… agitated. More so than usual. And… well, he’s been avoiding certain… pursuits, shall we say. He's a very private man, and this has been very upsetting for him.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Jinnie. Yellowish, thick discharge for about a week, noticed after intimacy, with an odor, and he's experiencing agitation and avoiding activities. Has he had any pain or burning when he… uses the restroom, or any itching or discomfort in that area?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You don't need to be so graphic, Doctor. Really. But… well, he hasn’t complained of pain, exactly. He's a stoic man. But he has been… quieter. And he flinches a little when he… cleans himself. It’s very subtle, but I’ve noticed. And, yes, he did mention a little… irritation. Not a full-blown rash or anything, thankfully. Just a bit of redness, he said. Honestly, he’s mortified I’m even telling you all of this. A gentleman doesn't discuss such things! But Esmeralda insisted... she said it could be something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult, Jinnie, and I appreciate you being so open. It’s good Esmeralda encouraged you to come in. So, no pain, but some flinching during cleaning and slight redness. Has he had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Absolutely never. He’s a very… careful man. Very hygienic. We’ve been… together for quite some time, and this is entirely new. He prides himself on his… cleanliness, you see. It’s a point of honor, almost. So this is especially distressing for him. He’s quite worried it’s something… contagious, though he wouldn’t admit it directly, of course. A gentleman doesn’t dwell on such unpleasantness. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite unwell just discussing it. Are you sure you need all these details? It's very… vulgar.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Jinnie, and I assure you, I’m only asking these questions to get a better understanding of what’s going on and to rule things out. It’s good he's typically so careful. And it’s helpful to know he’s never experienced this before. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Does he have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Really, Doctor. Must you? Well... he has been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. And his appetite hasn’t been quite the same. He used to adore his tapas, but he’s barely touched them the last few days. And... he’s been a bit… irritable. Snappish, even. Not towards me, of course, but towards the television, mostly. He watches a lot of bullfighting. Perhaps it's the heat? It's been dreadfully hot lately, you know. It might just be the weather, really. It’s just… unlike him. A gentleman is usually so composed.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, decreased appetite, and irritability, along with the discharge, flinching, and redness. Has he had any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Absolutely not. He’s always been very good at maintaining a healthy temperature. And no chills, thankfully. And no body aches that I’ve noticed. He doesn't complain about aches, you see. A gentleman bears his burdens in silence. He just… seems a bit… deflated. Like all the wind has been taken out of his sails. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite worrying. He’s usually such a vibrant, energetic man. I'm starting to think Esmeralda might be overreacting, but she was so adamant. She said it could be… something serious. Oh dear. This is all very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills or body aches. Just the discharge, redness, flinching, tiredness, decreased appetite and irritability. Now, regarding his past medical history – does he have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. Well, he doesn’t go to the doctor, you see. A gentleman prefers to avoid such things. He believes in… natural remedies. And a good siesta. And a strong sherry. He’s always been very… robust. Never a sickly day in his life, as far as I know. He used to be quite athletic, actually. Played a lot of… a game involving a ball. I can’t remember the name, but it involved a lot of running. He doesn't really discuss his health. It's… private. And frankly, Doctor, I haven't pressed him. A gentleman's health is his own concern. He's always been very… independent.
DOCTOR: Okay, so he doesn't typically see a doctor and generally good health. Has he ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? Oh dear, no. Absolutely not. He would never allow himself to be hospitalized. A gentleman maintains his dignity, you see. And hospitals are… unsavory places. Filled with germs and… unpleasantness. He might have had a… a small operation, years ago, on his… foot, perhaps? But it was very minor, and he recovered quickly. He doesn't like to dwell on such things. It was just a… nuisance, really. He doesn't like to talk about his… vulnerabilities. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not even sure it was an operation. It might just have been a particularly stubborn corn. He's a very private man. And frankly, I don’t pry. A gentleman’s past is his own affair.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially a minor foot issue years ago, but generally no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, what about his family?
PATIENT: His family… Oh dear. That's a… complicated subject. He doesn't speak about them. At all. He rarely even mentions their names. He… had a difficult upbringing, I believe. Something involving… a vineyard, perhaps? And a lot of… arguments. He left home very young, and hasn't had much contact with them since. He prefers it that way, I think. He's very independent, you see. And… protective. He doesn’t like to dwell on the past. Honestly, Doctor, it’s not something I’ve ever dared to ask about. A gentleman’s family life is his own business. I wouldn’t presume to pry. It’s… rude, you know. A very sensitive subject. He's very… reserved.
DOCTOR: Okay, no information on family history. Now, what about his lifestyle?
PATIENT: His… lifestyle? Really, Doctor. That sounds rather… prying. But… well, he enjoys his routine. He wakes up early, takes a walk, has a leisurely breakfast. He enjoys reading, particularly historical novels. And, of course, he enjoys… companionship. And his sherry. He's a man of simple pleasures, you see. He doesn’t smoke, thankfully. And he rarely drinks to excess. He's very… moderate in all things. He enjoys a good siesta in the afternoon. And, as I mentioned before, he enjoys watching bullfighting on television. He’s very… cultured, you see. He takes pride in his appearance, always well-groomed. And he enjoys… socializing with friends, occasionally. He’s a very… respectable man. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what more you could want to know. His lifestyle is… perfectly acceptable.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a regular routine, enjoys reading, companionship, sherry, bullfighting, and is well-groomed. Does he have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor. A gentleman doesn’t have allergies. But… well, he’s always been a bit sensitive to… dust, perhaps? He sneezes occasionally. And he’s not particularly fond of cats. He finds their fur… irritating. But it’s not a full-blown allergy, you understand. Just a… dislike. He's always been very careful about what he eats, only the freshest ingredients. He’s always been very… particular. He’s never had any serious allergic reactions, as far as I know. He wouldn't allow it. A gentleman takes pride in his well-being. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're being rather thorough. Are you suspecting something dreadful? It's all a bit… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some sensitivity to dust and dislike of cats, but no known serious allergies. And finally, is he currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. A gentleman does not need medications. He believes in natural remedies, you see. A good rest, a strong sherry, and a healthy diet. He occasionally takes a… herbal tea, perhaps, for his digestion. But it's nothing serious. He wouldn't dream of relying on… pharmaceuticals. He believes in taking care of himself, naturally. He wouldn't trust those… chemicals. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite faint. All these questions about his private life… It’s all very… vulgar. I think that’s all. Unless… you have further inquiries about his… habits? Really, Doctor. It’s all very… invasive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications, relies on natural remedies. Thank you, Jinnie. That’s very helpful. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A… a physical exam? On me? Doctor, are you quite serious? I came here to discuss his condition, not to be… prodded and poked! I understand you need to see him, but he’s… indisposed, as I’ve explained. He would be absolutely mortified! Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure I can allow that. It’s… improper! And quite… undignified. Perhaps you could suggest some… tests? Or a specialist? Anything but a physical exam! I came here as his representative, not as a… a patient. It's quite… shocking. Really, Doctor. I'm beginning to question my friend Esmeralda's judgement. I thought you were a professional! This is… unacceptable. .
