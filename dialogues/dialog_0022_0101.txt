DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right at the back of me head, you see? It’s been botherin' me for a little while now. Not constant, but when it comes on, it’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aldine. A headache at the back of your head, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a…a dull ache, really. And it feels tight, like someone’s put a band around me head. It usually starts in the afternoon, and lasts for a couple of hours, maybe three. Sometimes it spreads down me neck a little, but mostly it’s right there, at the back. I haven't hit me head or anything, if that's what you're thinkin'.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, just checking. A dull ache, tight sensation at the back of the head, sometimes spreading to the neck, usually in the afternoon for a couple of hours. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…bright lights do seem to make it worse. Not immediately, but if I'm out in the sun for too long, or lookin' at a bright screen, it’ll definitely get worse later on. And…lying down helps. A nice, dark, quiet room, and just restin'…that usually takes the edge off. I find a cool cloth on the back of me neck helps too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bright lights seem to be a trigger, and rest and a cool cloth offer some relief. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headaches?
PATIENT: Well, now…let me see. Sometimes, when the headache's bad, me vision gets a little blurry, but it doesn't last long. And I've been feelin' a bit tired lately, more tired than usual, but I put that down to me age, to be honest. I haven't been sick to me stomach, no dizziness, nothin' like that. Just the headache and the blurry vision sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, headache with occasional blurry vision and increased fatigue. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience for you?
PATIENT: This is…different. I've always gotten little headaches now and then, you know, the kind everyone gets. But they were never at the back of me head like this, and they didn’t bother me this much. These ones…they’re more persistent, and they really knock me off me feet when they come on. Started maybe a month or so ago, I’d say. I can’t quite put me finger on what brought ‘em on, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so these headaches are new in character and severity, starting about a month ago. You haven’t noticed any specific event or change that coincided with their start?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, now that you ask…me wife and I did some travelin' last month. Went to visit me daughter in Florida. A lot of sun, a lot of walkin’ around. Maybe it's somethin' to do with that? I didn’t think much of it at the time, just figured I was a bit out of shape after the trip. But maybe that started somethin' off? It was hot, very hot, mind you. And I wasn’t drinkin' as much water as I should have, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Aldine. Travel to Florida with a lot of sun exposure and potentially some dehydration. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve been blessed with good health, thankfully. I used to have a bit of arthritis in me hands, that's why I became a manicurist, kept 'em movin', you see. But that's pretty much it. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothin' like that. I don’t take any regular medication either. Just the occasional pain reliever for me hands when they’re achin’ real bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, good health overall, with some arthritis in your hands managed with occasional pain relievers. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always been too scared of 'em, to be honest! I've been lucky enough to avoid the need for 'em so far. My wife keeps tellin' me I'm a stubborn old man, but I prefer to think of myself as cautious.
DOCTOR: Cautious is a good word! Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, me mother, she lived to be 95, bless her soul. She had a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end, but other than that, she was pretty healthy. Me father…he passed away when I was young, from a chest infection. He wasn’t a healthy man, always coughin’ and wheezin’. Me daughter’s very healthy, thankfully. And me grandson, he's a strong young man. No major health problems on either side of the family, that I know of. We don’t really talk about that sort of thing much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you smoke, or drink alcohol, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, no smokin' for me. Never liked it. And I might have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Just a little sip now and then. Mostly I drink water, like I said. Important to stay hydrated, you know? Especially with these headaches.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in me life, and never had a reaction. And I haven't had any trouble with medications either. I’m very careful about what I put in me body, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a brief neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Been a bit nervous about these headaches, so anything you can do to figure it out, I’m all for. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 88. Your heart and lungs sound good. And your neurological exam is largely normal, though I do notice some tenderness when I press on the back of your neck. That probably correlates with your headache. Do you feel that tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's it! Right there, that's where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache, like a bruise. It's been feelin' sensitive for a little while now, especially when I move me head a certain way. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but when you press there, definitely. Feels like somethin'’s tight, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches. The tenderness in your neck, combined with the dull ache, the stress you've been under from travel, and the relief you get from rest and a cool cloth, all point in that direction. However, because your blood pressure is a little elevated, and because headaches can sometimes be a sign of something more serious, I'd like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. I appreciate you takin' the time to check everything properly. What sort of tests are you thinkin'? And will they be painful?
DOCTOR: No, they won’t be painful at all. I’d like to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And just to get a baseline, I’d also like to do a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Additionally, given your elevated blood pressure, I’d recommend a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring test to get a better understanding of your blood pressure throughout the day. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…a lot, but alright. If that’s what you think is best, I trust you. A bit worried now, I must admit. What does all this mean? Are you thinkin' somethin' serious is wrong? I just want to get back to me normal life, you know? Manicure appointments wait for no one.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Aldine, and it's good you’re being proactive. Ordering these tests is a standard precaution, not necessarily an indication that I suspect something serious. It's simply to rule out other potential causes for your headaches and get a more complete picture of your overall health. The most likely explanation, based on what you've told me, is still tension headaches triggered by stress and dehydration during your travel. But it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as thyroid problems or kidney issues, which can sometimes cause similar symptoms. We'll get the test results back within a few days, and then we can discuss them in detail and create a plan to manage your headaches. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, getting enough rest, and avoiding any triggers that seem to worsen your symptoms. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers if you’re not already taking them. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that…that makes me feel a bit better. Thank you for explainin' it so clearly. It's just…bein’ an old man, you start worryin’ about everything. Over-the-counter pain relievers…I've been takin' ibuprofen now and then, but it doesn't seem to do much good. So, these tests…where do I go to get them done? And how long will it take? I need to let me wife know, she drives me everywhere.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Aldine. It's natural to worry as we get older. Ibuprofen can be helpful for some, but it doesn’t work for everyone. You can get the tests done at the lab right here in the clinic building. They're open until 5 PM today. It should only take about 30-45 minutes for all of them. You don't need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Tosca ordered the CBC, BMP, and TSH tests. They will draw some blood. I’ll have the lab technician send the results directly to me. Once I review them, my nurse, Sarah, will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, if your headache gets significantly worse, or if you experience any new symptoms like fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s very clear. Thank you. Lab here in the clinic…that’s good. And Sarah will call to schedule an appointment. Right. I think that's all me questions for now. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me, and explain everything so thoroughly. It’s a weight off me mind, even if just a little one. Thank you again, Doctor Tosca.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aldine. I’m glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. And please, stay hydrated and get some rest. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, and please give my best to your wife.
