DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my blood pressure, really. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister – she's a nurse – told me I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I see. Your sister is quite prudent to advise you to come in. “A bit high,” you say. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Hmm, well, I don’t really know the numbers, to be honest. I bought one of those home monitors, you know, the ones you wrap around your arm? And it was flashing red a couple of times. That's when I got worried. It happened maybe three or four times over the last month or so, just when I was checking it at home. I don’t feel any different, though.
DOCTOR: Flashing red is… concerning, certainly. Though your subjective feeling of wellness is noted, it is not always indicative of a physiological issue. Do you recall approximately what the readings were when the monitor flashed red?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, no, I don’t. I really wish I'd written them down, but I didn’t think it would be this serious, you know? I just saw the red light and thought, "Okay, that's not good." It was definitely over 120 something... I think. But honestly, Doctor, I’m not good with numbers. Is there a way you can just, like, check it now and tell me if it’s bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. That is precisely what we will do. It's rather unhelpful to rely on recollection alone. We will obtain an accurate reading here in the office. Before we do that, however, I must inquire about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never been diagnosed with anything. I've been pretty healthy, actually. Just the usual colds and stuff. My mom had diabetes, but that was when she got older, you know? I try to eat right and walk when I can, but work keeps me pretty busy. I work at a few different places, helping people out. Mostly seniors, with their shopping and stuff. It's a good job, but it's not always easy on your feet.
DOCTOR: A commendable profession. And a physically demanding one, as you say. Family history of diabetes is pertinent information, thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, nope. And thankfully, I’ve never had to be in the hospital. Knock on wood! Just regular check-ups with the dentist, and stuff like that. I have Medicare, so I try to stay on top of things. I think I had a flu shot last year, maybe the year before. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A sensible approach to preventative care, though a precise record is preferable. And Medicare coverage is excellent. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything! I mean, I don't love shellfish, but it doesn’t make me sick or anything. My sister always asks if I'm allergic to penicillin, but I've never had a problem with it. I've had it a couple of times when I was a kid, I think. Just the usual stuff, you know, for a sore throat or something.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to just tough things out, you know? A little pain reliever now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I don't really believe in all those fancy supplements either. Just seems like a waste of money.
DOCTOR: A pragmatic approach. Very well. Now, let us proceed with a physical examination. I will begin by checking your vital signs, including your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then, I will listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I hope it's not too bad! I’m always a bit nervous at the doctor.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. We shall proceed methodically, and I will explain everything as we go. Relax your arm, and breathe normally. Systolic 148 over diastolic 92. Elevated. Pulse is 76 and regular. Respiration rate is 16 and unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable, aside from the elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated… that doesn't sound good, does it? So what does that mean, Doctor? Is it really serious? I’m getting a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It does necessitate further investigation, Ms. Sladen. A single elevated reading is not necessarily cause for alarm, but persistent hypertension – as your home monitoring suggests – is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney damage. We must determine the underlying cause of your elevated blood pressure. I would like to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis – to assess your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and cholesterol levels. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to evaluate your heart’s electrical activity. Additionally, it would be beneficial to obtain a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor, to get a more accurate picture of your blood pressure fluctuations throughout the day and night. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Wow, that's a lot of tests. I mean, if you think it’s necessary, but… honestly, it sounds a bit scary. I just came in because my sister said my blood pressure was a little high, not because I’m feeling sick or anything! But if it could be something serious, I guess I should do them. What exactly does all that… stuff… involve? Like, do they take a lot of blood? And how long will it take to get the results? And… will it cost me a lot of money?
DOCTOR: Your apprehension is understandable, Ms. Sladen. However, these tests are standard procedures for evaluating hypertension and are essential for determining the appropriate course of treatment. The blood work involves a simple venipuncture – a small needle insertion to draw a sample of blood from your arm. It typically takes only a few minutes, and the discomfort is minimal. The urinalysis requires you to provide a urine sample – a collection cup will be provided. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor is a small, portable device that you wear on your arm for 24 hours. It measures your blood pressure at regular intervals and records the data. As for the cost, it will depend on your Medicare coverage. We have a billing department that can assist you with any questions regarding your financial responsibility. I assure you, we will work to minimize your out-of-pocket expenses. The results of the blood work should be available within 3 to 5 business days. The EKG results are typically available immediately. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn’t sound as bad as I thought, I guess. Wearing a monitor for a day… I can do that. And if the billing department can help, that’s good. I don’t really understand all the numbers and stuff, so I’m glad you’ll explain everything. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Just… please don’t tell me I have to take a bunch of pills! Is there anything else I can do besides… tests and maybe pills? Like, can I just eat healthier and walk more? Would that help? I really don't like taking medication.
DOCTOR: Lifestyle modifications – a healthy diet and regular exercise – are always recommended, Ms. Sladen, and are an essential component of any hypertension management plan. However, they may not be sufficient to control your blood pressure, particularly given your current readings. We must first determine the underlying cause of your hypertension before we can formulate an appropriate treatment strategy. Perhaps your blood pressure is elevated due to stress, anxiety, or an underlying medical condition. These factors must be ruled out before we can determine whether lifestyle modifications alone are sufficient. While I appreciate your reluctance to take medication, it is important to understand that certain antihypertensive medications can significantly reduce your risk of cardiovascular events and improve your overall health. I assure you, I will only prescribe medication if it is absolutely necessary. For now, let us proceed with the aforementioned tests. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. I will provide you with a list of resources on healthy eating and exercise, but please do not self-treat or make any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle without first consulting with me. Do you consent to these tests, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: Okay, okay… you've convinced me. I’ll do the tests. I just… I really don’t want to take pills if I don’t have to. Yes, I consent. Let’s just get it over with. When can I schedule the follow-up? And… how do I get the list of resources you mentioned?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The laboratory is located down the hall, to your left. They will draw the blood sample and collect the urine sample. The technician will provide you with instructions on how to wear the ambulatory blood pressure monitor. I have my nurse schedule the follow-up appointment for you. She will contact you within 24 hours to confirm a date and time that is convenient for you. In the meantime, I will have her provide you with a handout on dietary changes for hypertension, as well as a list of local walking groups and exercise classes. Are there any other concerns you would like to address at this time, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll go get the tests done. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it was a lot. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, adherence to the testing protocol is crucial for accurate results. We shall determine the appropriate course of action at your follow-up appointment. .
