DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. I’m Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh, it's nice to meet you too. Right. Well, it's… my head. It's been giving me trouble. Like, really bad headaches. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart races. It's a bit scary, to be honest. I don't really… remember when it started exactly. It's been happening on and off for a while now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come and go, with sweating and a racing heart… that does sound concerning, and I understand why it would be scary. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When you say "on and off," can you give me a rough idea of how often these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Umm… that's a tough one. Not every day, definitely. Maybe… a few times a month? Sometimes it'll be a couple of weeks between them, other times they're closer together. Honestly, I haven’t really kept track. It's just… when one starts, I'm mostly focused on getting through it. It's hard to think about counting or anything. Does that make sense? I'm not very good with details.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jaxston. It’s understandable to focus on coping when you're experiencing something unpleasant. So, a few times a month, with varying gaps in between. Can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right, the headaches… They're not like a normal headache, you know? It’s not just a dull ache. It feels… really intense. Like a pounding, throbbing feeling, mostly on the sides of my head. Sometimes it feels like pressure, too. And it can get really bad, so bad I have to lie down in a dark room. They usually last for… hours, I think. A few hours, anyway. It's hard to say for sure when I'm in the middle of one. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, throbbing, intense pain on the sides of your head, sometimes with pressure, lasting for hours. And it's severe enough to make you lie down. You also mentioned feeling "fuzzy" during these episodes. Do you notice anything that triggers these headaches – anything that seems to bring them on?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I really haven’t noticed anything specific. It doesn't seem to be linked to stress, or what I'm eating, or anything like that. Sometimes they just… happen. I’ve tried thinking about it, trying to figure out if there’s a pattern, but I can’t seem to find one. I had one a couple of weeks ago after doing some work in the garden, but I do that all the time and usually nothing happens. I honestly don't know what sets them off. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jaxston. It’s tough when there doesn’t seem to be a clear cause. Alright, let’s move on to other symptoms. Besides the headache, sweating, and racing heart, have you noticed anything else happening during these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… nauseous, like I might be sick, but I haven't actually been sick. And things look… weird. Not blurry, exactly, but… like I'm seeing spots, or little flashes of light. It doesn't last long, just for a bit at the start, maybe. I think that’s it. Oh! And I get really sensitive to light. Bright lights are awful when one of these is coming on. I have to close the curtains.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, visual disturbances – spots or flashes of light – and sensitivity to light. Those are all important details. Have you experienced any changes in your vision outside of these headache episodes?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision seems normal most of the time. I had my eyes checked a couple of years ago and the doctor said everything was fine. It's just during the headaches that things get… strange. It goes back to normal after they're over. I haven't noticed anything different when I'm feeling okay.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Uhm… not that I can remember, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And I've had the usual colds and flus, I suppose. Nothing major. I’ve never been in the hospital for anything serious. I don’t really go to the doctor much, unless I have to. Honestly, my memory isn’t great, so I probably forget things. I'm sorry I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Jaxston. You’re doing just fine. We can work with what you do remember. Have you ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgery. Nope. Nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I've always been fairly healthy, aside from these headaches, of course. Though, I suppose, I shouldn’t say ‘lucky’ when I’m here complaining about them. Sorry, I ramble sometimes.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. It's good to get a clear picture of things. And it’s perfectly reasonable to seek help when something is bothering you. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mum had… arthritis, maybe? She’s passed away now, so I don’t really remember the details. I don't know if anyone else had headaches like these. I didn't really talk about health stuff much with my family. We weren't really close like that. It’s… complicated. Does that make sense? I'm not sure if it's helpful information.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jaxston. It's helpful to know what you do remember. And it sounds like it’s a sensitive topic, so don’t feel pressured to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a bit, a couple of beers on the weekend, but I stopped a while ago. Didn't really agree with me. And no, definitely no drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. I try to eat fairly healthy, but I have a sweet tooth, so I indulge in biscuits now and then. Nothing too bad, I promise. I work pretty hard, mostly physical labor, so I try to take it easy when I can.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I've taken painkillers for headaches before, like paracetamol, and they help a bit, but they don't really get rid of them completely. I haven’t taken anything stronger than that. I’m a bit cautious about taking medications, to be honest. I don’t like feeling… out of it, or anything like that. Is there anything else I should tell you? I feel like I'm forgetting something…
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers most of the important questions. Thank you for being so open with me, Jaxston. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m a bit worried, if I’m honest. It's just... they're getting more frequent, and they scare me a little. So, yeah, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. Fundi appear normal. No signs of papilledema. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, symmetric. Neck is supple, no tenderness to palpation. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Okay, Jaxston. Everything appears normal with the physical exam, but based on your history of recurring severe headaches with associated symptoms like sweating, racing heart, nausea, and visual disturbances, I am concerned about the possibility of migraine headaches. However, given the frequency and your concern, we need to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Migraine? I've heard of those, but… I thought those were just bad headaches. Is it serious? Should I be worried? And what do you mean by “rule out other causes”? Will I need… tests? I don't really like hospitals or anything like that. I just want to get this sorted out, if that makes sense. This is… a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It is a bit overwhelming, and I understand your anxiety. Migraine can present in many different ways, and sometimes the symptoms can overlap with other conditions. While migraines aren’t life-threatening in most cases, they can significantly impact your quality of life, and it’s important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. “Ruling out other causes” means we need to investigate to make sure there isn’t something else causing your headaches. In your case, I’m thinking about things like tension headaches, cluster headaches, or, less likely, more serious conditions like a brain tumor or aneurysm. To do that, I’d like to order a CT scan of your head. It's a quick and painless imaging test that will give us a detailed view of your brain. It doesn’t involve any radiation, and it’s the best way to rule out anything serious. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… scary. Does it hurt? And what if you do find something? I really don’t want to hear bad news. Is there… anything else we can do first? Maybe try some medication? I don’t really like the idea of being stuck in a hospital, or having machines poking around inside my head. This is just… a lot. I'm getting a bit flustered. I'm sorry. I should be brave, but… I'm not very good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to feel anxious, Jaxston. It’s not about being brave; it’s about making informed decisions. And you're not being unreasonable at all. The CT scan is very quick and painless. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. There’s no poking or prodding involved. It’s like getting a detailed X-ray of your brain. And we’ll be right there with you the whole time. Before we jump to a scan, we can try medication to see if it helps alleviate your symptoms. I can prescribe a triptan, which is a medication specifically designed to treat migraines. It works by constricting blood vessels in the brain and reducing inflammation. However, if the medication doesn’t help, or if your symptoms worsen, we’ll need to get that CT scan to rule out anything more serious. What do you think?
PATIENT: Okay… medication first sounds… better. I’d prefer to try that before having a scan. If it doesn’t work, then I guess I’ll have to face the scan, but… let’s see if we can avoid that, if possible. What does this triptan… do? And are there any side effects? I get worried about taking medication, like I said. I just want to feel normal again. It’s exhausting being constantly worried about when the next headache will hit.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Jaxston. It's good to be cautious about medication, and we'll go through everything thoroughly. Triptans work by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, which helps reduce inflammation and alleviate the pain and other symptoms associated with migraines. They're generally very effective, but they don't work for everyone. Common side effects can include nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. Some people experience a tightening sensation in their chest or throat, but this is rare. It’s important to let me know if you experience any unusual symptoms after taking the medication. I’ll prescribe a low dose of sumatriptan to start with. It’s a tablet you take as soon as you feel a headache coming on. I’ll also give you some instructions on how to take it and what to do if it doesn't work. If the medication doesn’t provide relief, or if your symptoms worsen, we’ll discuss scheduling that CT scan. But let’s try this medication first and see how you respond. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Trying the medication first seems like the right thing to do. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a bit better knowing what to expect. And thank you for being patient with me. I’m not very good at this medical stuff, as you can probably tell. So, sumatriptan… I'll try to remember all of this. And I'll let you know if anything feels… off. What if it doesn't work right away? How long should I wait before calling you? I don't want to bother you if it just needs a bit of time.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Jaxston. That’s what I’m here for. Sumatriptan usually starts working within 30-60 minutes, but it can take up to two hours for some people. If you don’t notice any improvement after two hours, or if your symptoms worsen, please call the clinic right away. We can discuss other options, or schedule that CT scan if needed. I’ll write you a prescription, and I’ll also give you a detailed information sheet about sumatriptan, including potential side effects and what to do in case of an emergency. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in managing your headaches. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Sieh. You've been very helpful. And patient. I really appreciate it. I’ll try the medication, and I’ll call if anything happens. I think… I think I can handle this. Hopefully.
DOCTOR: You absolutely can handle this, Jaxston. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Get well soon, and take care. .
