DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I was expecting someone… taller. But never mind that. I am here because my husband, bless his heart, insists I get one of these… Advance Directives, is it? Or a POLST form. He says we need to be prepared. I find the whole thing rather morbid, if you must know, but he’s been quite insistent. I suppose it’s best to get it over with.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Marija. It can feel a bit daunting to think about these things. Your husband is very thoughtful to encourage you to get this taken care of – being prepared is always a good idea. It’s not morbid at all, really; it's about making sure your wishes are known if you ever weren't able to speak for yourself. We can discuss both Advance Directives and POLST forms, and figure out which is the best fit for you, or even do both if you'd like. Before we dive into that, though, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health? Well, I am a professor, if that tells you anything. It requires a great deal of mental fortitude, naturally. I do try to eat reasonably well, though my husband insists on making tagine every Friday, and that's a bit… heavy, if you understand. I walk when I can, but honestly, grading papers is quite enough exercise, I assure you. I have no diagnosed conditions, if that is what you are asking. I’ve always been… robust. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, really. Honestly, I find most of them rather… condescending. Are we going to spend the whole appointment discussing my diet? Because I assure you, it is perfectly adequate.
DOCTOR: No, Marija, we’re not going to spend the whole appointment discussing your diet! I appreciate you sharing that with me, though. It's good to know you’re active and generally healthy. And I apologize if you’ve had negative experiences with doctors in the past – I assure you I have no intention of being condescending. Just trying to get a general picture of things. To clarify, when you say you haven’t been to a doctor in years, have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses? No. Nothing of any import. I had the flu once, perhaps ten years ago. A rather nasty bout, but I recovered perfectly well. And a broken wrist when I was a child, climbing a fig tree, but that was hardly significant. Honestly, I am a very healthy woman. I eat well – despite my husband’s tagine – and I keep my mind active. What precisely does this have to do with telling the doctor what should happen if… if something were to happen? It seems rather roundabout, doesn't it? Perhaps you could explain the difference between these "Advance Directives" and the "POLST" form, and then I can decide which, if either, is necessary. I haven't much time, you understand. The new semester begins in a few weeks, and the syllabus needs revising.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask me to get to the point, Marija. I apologize for the roundabout approach. It’s just standard practice to get a bit of medical history first, but your health seems quite good, as you say. Let me explain the difference. An Advance Directive – also known as a Living Will – is a document that outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to make decisions for yourself. It covers things like whether or not you want life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube. It comes into play if you’re in a situation where there's no reasonable hope of recovery. A POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit different. It’s a medical order, based on your wishes, that tells healthcare providers what to do in an emergency. It’s more specific than an Advance Directive, and it's typically used by people with serious illnesses or frailty. It’s a portable medical order, meaning it's visible to all healthcare providers. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: That… is marginally clearer, I suppose. So, the Advance Directive is a hypothetical document for a hypothetical situation, and the POLST form is… for people who are already unwell? I assure you, Doctor, I am not already unwell. I find the entire concept rather unsettling. All this talk of ventilators and feeding tubes... It’s dreadfully morbid. Perhaps I should just refuse both. Is that an option? Can I simply tell everyone to do everything possible to keep me alive, regardless? My husband seems to think I need to be "realistic," whatever that means. He's always been rather dramatic. So, if I refuse both, is that… acceptable? And will this take much longer? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to express your concerns, Marija. It is unsettling to think about these things, and you have every right to refuse either document. It is perfectly acceptable – and, in fact, your right – to choose not to have an Advance Directive or a POLST form. And yes, stating that you want "everything possible to be done" to keep you alive is a valid choice. That's what we call a "full code" – it means we would initiate all life-saving measures if you were to become critically ill. The decision is entirely yours, and we can document your wishes in your chart regardless of whether or not you choose one of the forms. We don't need to do either one. To clarify, and just to be thorough, do you have any specific concerns about what might happen if you were to become seriously ill?
PATIENT: Well… my husband is rather insistent on allowing "nature to take its course," as he puts it. He’s always been rather fond of philosophical pronouncements. I, however, have no desire to be left to “nature.” I find that rather alarming, frankly. So, if I were to become seriously ill, and he were to… insist on removing life support, despite my wishes, would these forms prevent that? That is my primary concern. He's a retired professor of ethics, you understand. He thinks he knows best. And he has a rather… persuasive manner. So, would either of these forms legally prevent him from making decisions I do not agree with? That is what I need to know. And quickly, if you don’t mind. I truly do have a great deal on my plate.
DOCTOR: That's a very important question, Marija, and you're right to be concerned. Both Advance Directives and POLST forms can legally prevent your husband from making decisions that go against your wishes, but it's not always straightforward. Here's how it works. With an Advance Directive, you would name a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to. The healthcare proxy is legally obligated to follow your wishes as outlined in the document. A POLST form, being a medical order, is even more direct. It clearly states what treatments you want and don’t want, and healthcare providers are legally bound to follow those orders. However, it’s important to understand that there can be legal challenges, especially if there's disagreement among family members. Having a clearly worded document and a designated healthcare proxy is the best way to ensure your wishes are respected. I have here a sample Advance Directive form, and we can discuss naming a healthcare proxy. Would you like me to go through it with you?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… Yes, I suppose that is necessary. Someone who understands my… aversion to being left to “nature,” as my husband so delicately puts it. Perhaps my sister, Fatima? She’s a lawyer, and she’s always been quite sensible. Though, she does tend to overanalyze everything. But, yes, Fatima. And what if my husband disagrees with Fatima? Will the document automatically override his wishes? That is what I need to know. I simply cannot abide being left to… fade away. I have far too much grading to do. The syllabus revisions alone will take weeks. So, if he tries to… interfere, will this document legally protect my wishes? And can we make it very clear that I want everything possible done to keep me alive, regardless of his philosophical objections? I need a document that is… ironclad.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we can absolutely make that happen. Naming Fatima as your healthcare proxy is a good choice, and we can clearly state in the document that you want “all possible life-sustaining treatment” in the event you’re unable to communicate your wishes. And to answer your question directly, an Advance Directive legally prioritizes your wishes as expressed in the document over the wishes of family members, including your husband. However, as I mentioned before, it’s not always a perfectly smooth process. If there were a disagreement, the healthcare providers would consult with Fatima as your designated proxy, and they would be legally obligated to follow her decisions as long as they are consistent with your stated wishes. Here, in this section, we can specifically outline your preferences for life-sustaining treatment. We’ll state that you want all measures taken to preserve life, including mechanical ventilation, CPR, and artificial nutrition. We can also include a statement addressing your husband’s potential objections, stating that you have made a conscious and informed decision to prioritize life-sustaining treatment, regardless of philosophical considerations. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds precisely what I need. “Philosophical considerations” indeed. He's a menace, I tell you. A menace! And yes, please include that. And mechanical ventilation, CPR, and artificial nutrition… absolutely. Leave nothing to chance. The syllabus revisions are far too important. And will Fatima need to sign something as well? To confirm she understands my wishes? And will this document be… widely accessible? To all healthcare providers? I wouldn’t want it to be lost in a filing cabinet somewhere. It needs to be… readily available. And can we perhaps make a copy for my sister, just to be certain? I simply cannot trust anyone to handle this properly without a great deal of supervision. Oh, and one more thing… Can we include a clause stating that my husband is not authorized to make any decisions regarding my end-of-life care? Just to be absolutely clear. I know it sounds… drastic, but I simply cannot abide being left to… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we can absolutely include all of that. Fatima will need to sign the document as your designated healthcare proxy, acknowledging that she understands her role and responsibilities and agrees to advocate for your wishes. The document will be scanned into your electronic medical record, making it accessible to all healthcare providers involved in your care. We can also provide Fatima with a copy for her records. I can even fax a copy to her office directly, if you'd like. And yes, we can include a specific clause stating that your husband is not authorized to make any decisions regarding your end-of-life care. It’s perfectly acceptable to designate a specific individual, and it will be clearly documented in your chart. Here’s the clause: “I specifically designate Fatima [Sister’s Last Name] as my healthcare proxy and explicitly state that my husband, [Husband’s Name], is not authorized to make any decisions regarding my end-of-life care.” Does this meet your needs, Marija?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that is perfect. Absolutely perfect. A small victory against philosophical obstinacy. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… remarkably accommodating. And efficient. A rare quality these days. Faxing a copy to Fatima would be wonderful. And perhaps if you could highlight that clause regarding my husband… just to be certain. He has a way of… misinterpreting things. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. The syllabus revisions are calling, and I fear they will not revise themselves. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been… a lifesaver. Ironically.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. It was my pleasure to assist you. I’m glad we were able to get this taken care of. I’ll make a note to fax a copy of the document to Fatima immediately, and I’ll be sure to highlight that clause for you. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And good luck with those syllabus revisions! Have a good day, Marija.
