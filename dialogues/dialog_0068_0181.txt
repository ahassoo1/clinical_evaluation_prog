DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Sham. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. The pleasure is all mine. I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be proactive. I believe the results came back, and I was hoping we could go over them.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here. A general wellness check… proactive is good. Let me pull up the results… Hmm. Okay. It’s a fairly standard panel. Now, to be honest, my recall isn’t what it used to be… so bear with me. I'll just highlight the things that stood out. Do you have any particular concerns you wanted to address first, or shall we go through it systematically?
PATIENT: Systematically sounds best, Doctor. I trust your expertise to point out anything important. I wouldn't even know where to begin looking at those numbers, truthfully. Perhaps starting from the top is a good approach? I want to be sure I understand everything, so please don't hesitate to explain things simply. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let's start with your complete blood count – CBC. We check this to look at your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Everything seems within normal limits there… hemoglobin is 14.2, which is good… white blood cell count… 7.8… also normal. Platelets are 250,000. No immediate concerns there. Do you experience any unusual bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I'm a construction laborer, you see – I get my share of bumps and scrapes, naturally, but nothing beyond the usual. They clot up just fine, as far as I can tell. I've never had any issues with excessive bleeding, thankfully. It’s a relief to hear the blood work is alright, at least. That's always a worry, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Good, good. No excessive bleeding… That’s reassuring. Alright, let's move on to your basic metabolic panel – BMP. This checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. Your glucose was… 98. That's perfectly normal. Creatinine… 1.1. Again, within the normal range, indicating your kidneys are functioning appropriately. Electrolytes all look good as well. Sodium, potassium, chloride… all within acceptable limits. Are you on any medications currently, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. Never have been, thankfully. I've always prided myself on staying healthy and avoiding medications if at all possible. Just a good diet, plenty of water, and hard work, I suppose. It’s good to know things are still functioning as they should. What's next on the list?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's excellent. Let's see… your lipid panel – cholesterol levels. Total cholesterol is 210… LDL is 140… HDL is 45… and triglycerides are 150. Now, the LDL is a little elevated… We generally want that under 100. The HDL is… okay, could be better. We like to see that above 60. Do you have a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: That's… interesting. I hadn't known about those numbers specifically. My father, yes, he had some heart trouble later in life, needed a stent, I believe it was called. My mother, she was always very healthy, surprisingly. Lived to be ninety-two, strong as an ox, she was. So, the LDL being elevated… that’s not good, is it? What does that mean, precisely? And what can be done about it?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease… that’s relevant. The elevated LDL, it means you have a higher risk of plaque buildup in your arteries. It’s not an immediate crisis, but it’s something we want to address. Now, first, we can try lifestyle modifications: diet, exercise... reducing saturated and trans fats. We also have medications – statins – that can lower LDL, but we usually reserve those for higher-risk individuals or when lifestyle changes aren’t enough. What's your typical diet like, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, being a construction laborer, I tend to eat… hearty foods. A lot of meat, to be honest – gives me the energy I need. Rice and beans, plenty of it. Not a lot of fancy vegetables, I admit. I try to eat a good breakfast, eggs mostly, and take a good lunch to work – sandwiches, things like that. I don't really drink sugary sodas, just water, mostly. I suppose it's not the healthiest diet, you're right. I’ve never really had to worry about my weight, so I haven’t focused much on it. Perhaps it’s time I did. Would cutting back on the meat be the most important thing?
DOCTOR: Cutting back on the red meat and processed foods would be a good starting point. Increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains would be beneficial as well. Small changes can make a big difference. Let's talk about exercise. How active are you outside of work?
PATIENT: That’s fair, Doctor. I suppose my diet is rather… limited. I've always believed in a good, solid meal for a hard day's work, but perhaps that’s not the complete picture. As for exercise… well, construction is pretty physically demanding, to be frank. Lifting, hauling, climbing… I’m on my feet all day. I wouldn’t call it intentional exercise, but I certainly get a workout. I don’t really do much else, though. No gym, no running, no swimming. Just work, mostly. Is that enough, do you think? Or do I need to add something extra to the routine?
DOCTOR: Your work is physically demanding, and that's certainly good for your cardiovascular health. However, incorporating some dedicated exercise – even 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the week – can provide additional benefits. Alright, let's move on to your prostate-specific antigen – PSA. This is a screening test for prostate cancer. Yours was… 1.2. That's within the normal range for your age. Overall, your results are mostly within normal limits, with the exception of your slightly elevated LDL cholesterol. We can start with lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – and recheck your lipid panel in three months. Does that sound agreeable to you, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Three months gives me time to adjust my habits, you're right. I'll focus on cutting back the meat and adding some extra walking after work. Perhaps a walk along the river. It’s reassuring to hear the PSA and everything else is alright. You've put my mind at ease, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It's good to know things are mostly stable. No, I don’t have any further questions at this time. Just monitor for any new symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, unexplained fatigue – and contact the office immediately if anything arises. I’ll send a summary of our discussion to your primary care physician. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your time and expertise. You’ve given me a good plan of action, and I feel much more confident knowing what to look out for. Thank you again for everything. I suppose that’s all for today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
