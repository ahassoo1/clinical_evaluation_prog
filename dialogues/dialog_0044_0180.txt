DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. I’m just... tired. Really tired. And I... well, it’s embarrassing. I keep wanting to eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but... I just feel like I need it. It's stupid, I know. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Cantoran. It doesn't sound stupid to me. It's good you’re telling me about this. Feeling excessively tired and having unusual cravings – like you’re describing – those are things we should definitely explore. It takes courage to talk about things that feel embarrassing, so thank you for being open with me. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Years, probably. Honestly, I can’t really pinpoint it. It just... got worse. I thought it was just getting older, you know? My husband... he passed a few years back, and I figured it was grief. But it hasn't gotten better. It’s just… dragging. Everything feels like dragging. I just want to sit. All. The. Time.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Cantoran. Grief can certainly have a lasting impact, and it's completely understandable that you'd be feeling this way. It's good you're acknowledging it hasn’t gotten better with time, though. That’s an important piece of information. You said everything feels like dragging. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It’s just… hard to do anything. Even getting up to make coffee is an effort. I used to be… not energetic, exactly, but I did things. I worked, I kept up the house… now? Now I just stare at the TV. And I get… frustrated. Easily. Everything annoys me. And this dirt thing… it’s like, a little voice telling me I need it. It's ridiculous. I tried eating some from the garden, and… it just felt… right? Is that weird?
DOCTOR: It’s not weird at all, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds like you’re describing a constellation of symptoms, and we need to explore them all. The fatigue, the frustration, and this craving…they're all connected somehow. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I just want to check your vital signs and do a basic neurological assessment. Then we can talk about your medical history and go from there. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do… well, I got nothing to do, but I’d like to do things, if I had the energy. Just… don’t poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Ms. Cantoran. This will be quick and gentle. Okay, everything seems within normal limits so far, physically. Your vital signs are good, and your reflexes are normal. I didn't notice anything concerning during the basic neurological exam. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. I don’t even remember. I… I had the usual childhood things, I guess. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. As an adult… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… uh… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it went down with diet. I don’t go to doctors much. Never liked them. And… honestly, I can’t remember much else. Is this important? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you. The gallbladder removal and the history of high blood pressure are good to know. It’s alright if you don’t remember everything precisely. We can work with what you do recall. Do you know if anyone in your family has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died young. My father… he was fine, as far as I know. Always worked hard. He was a farmer. And… that’s about it. We weren’t a close family. Not much talking. I don’t really know much about their medical history. It wasn't something we discussed. I have a cousin, somewhere, but I haven’t seen her in years.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history. Knowing about the potential heart condition in your mother is helpful, though. Now, let's talk about your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t take anything. I don’t like pills. Makes me sick just thinking about them. Never have. And allergies? Dust, maybe. But that’s it. I’m a pretty healthy person, usually. This dirt thing is just… weird. It's new. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. That’s good to know. No medications or known allergies besides a possible dust sensitivity. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? None of that. Never. My husband… he smoked a little, when he was younger, but I made him stop. I don't even like being around people who smoke. And alcohol? Gives me a headache. And drugs? Don't be ridiculous. I'm a sensible woman. I spend most of my time at home, watching TV. That’s about it. Not much to do anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ms. Cantoran. That’s helpful information. So, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Primarily spending time at home. Now, let's return to this craving you've been experiencing. You mentioned wanting to eat dirt. How often do you feel this urge?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… getting worse. At first, it was just… a thought. Like, “Oh, that dirt looks… nice.” Now, it's almost constant. I find myself looking at the garden, thinking about it. I tried eating some yesterday, and… well, it felt good. Calming. I know it's stupid, but… it’s like something I need. I even had a dream about it. I don’t usually remember my dreams. It's embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: It's not stupid at all, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds like this craving is very real and causing you distress. The fact that it's becoming more frequent and even appearing in your dreams is significant. This craving, medically, is called pica. It's characterized by a persistent desire to eat non-nutritive substances, like dirt. Now, pica can sometimes be associated with nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron or zinc. It can also be a symptom of other underlying medical conditions. Given your symptoms of fatigue and this persistent craving, I think it's important to run some blood tests to check your iron levels, zinc levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. I hate needles. But… if it might help… fine. I just want this… feeling to go away. I just want to feel normal again. Do I have to go somewhere special? I don't drive much anymore.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Cantoran. I understand your aversion to needles. We can do the blood draw right here in the clinic. Our nurse, Maria, is very skilled, and we'll make it as quick and painless as possible. The tests will help us determine if there are any underlying nutritional deficiencies contributing to your symptoms. Based on the results, we can then develop a treatment plan to address the root cause of the problem. While we wait for the results, I'd like to ask you about your diet. Can you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Honestly? Not much. I don’t cook much anymore. I used to… when my husband was alive. Now I mostly eat… canned soup. Or sandwiches. White bread, mostly. And… sometimes I have a little ice cream. I don’t have much of an appetite. Everything tastes… bland. It’s just easier that way. Not much energy for cooking. And it’s just… me. No one to cook for.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. That's helpful to know. A diet consisting primarily of canned soup, sandwiches made with white bread, and occasional ice cream. A limited appetite and a feeling of bland taste. This could be contributing to some nutritional deficiencies, which we'll investigate with the blood tests. Given your history of fatigue, this unusual craving, and your limited diet, I'm also going to order a thyroid panel. Sometimes, fatigue and changes in appetite can be associated with thyroid problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Honestly, it's like you're expecting me to be falling apart. But… if you think it’s necessary… fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just… get me feeling better. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life wanting to eat dirt. And… can we hurry this up? I’m getting tired just talking about it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. It's not about expecting you to be falling apart, it's about being thorough and ruling out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. We want to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better as quickly as possible. Okay, I’ll order the thyroid panel and the blood tests now. Maria will come in shortly to draw the blood. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… when will I get the results? And what if it’s something… bad? Honestly, I don’t want to hear about it if it’s something terrible. I just want a pill. Can you just give me a pill? A vitamin pill, maybe? Or something. Anything to make this stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Cantoran. It's perfectly natural to be worried about what the results might show. The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to process the tests. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time. We'll address any concerns and develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs. While a vitamin pill might temporarily alleviate some symptoms, it’s important to identify the underlying cause of your fatigue and craving before starting any treatment. Based on the results, we can then determine the best course of action. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. Maria will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Just… hurry up. I’m getting a headache. All this talking… it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. I’ll let Maria know you’re ready. She’ll be in shortly. Please just relax and try to take a few deep breaths. I'll be right back to discuss the next steps once the blood draw is complete. Maria, could you please come in and draw some blood from Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: .
