DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a… a lump, I suppose you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. A lump in the lower abdomen. And how long exactly has it been present?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… probably about three months, maybe a little longer. It wasn't very noticeable at first, just felt… different. But it’s grown a bit since then, and now I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months or so. And has it been consistently growing, or has it fluctuated in size?
PATIENT: It’s been pretty consistent, I’d say. Not a huge jump at any one time, but definitely bigger now than it was a month ago. It doesn’t feel like it’s getting painful, just… there. It's a bit worrying, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Raghunathan. It's always best to get these things checked out. Now, can you describe the lump to me?
PATIENT: Well, it feels… firm. Not hard as a rock, but definitely not soft and squishy. It's sort of… roundish, I suppose. And it's located… right about here. I’m not sure how big exactly, maybe the size of a plum?
DOCTOR: Okay, firm, roundish, about the size of a plum, located in the lower center of your abdomen. And have you noticed any other symptoms associated with it?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, like I said. No fever, no changes in my bowel habits… nothing like that. Just the lump. I have been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? I wasn't sure if that was related.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits. You've mentioned some fatigue, which, as you say, is common. We'll certainly keep that in mind. Now, Mr. Raghunathan, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will involve me gently palpating your abdomen to get a better sense of the lump's size, shape, and consistency. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement. I’d like to know what’s going on, so whatever you need to do to figure that out is fine with me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently palpate the area you described. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful at any point. Okay. I am noting some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, consistent with the area you indicated. The mass itself feels approximately 3 centimeters in diameter, firm, and non-mobile. There doesn't appear to be any rebound tenderness or guarding. I’m not feeling any enlarged lymph nodes in the groin. Do you feel any discomfort with this pressure?
PATIENT: It’s… a little uncomfortable, yes, but not painful. More like a dull pressure. It feels… different than just regular pressure, if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t feel sharp, just… noticeable. And, now that you mention it, yes, I think it is a bit bigger than I originally thought. Maybe closer to the size of a golf ball now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a golf ball size, and a dull pressure rather than sharp pain. That’s helpful to know. Given the size, firmness, and the fact that it’s non-mobile, I’d like to order some imaging to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. I'm thinking a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would be most appropriate. This will allow us to visualize the mass and surrounding structures in more detail. Before we proceed with that, could you please tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses or surgeries. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a child, but that was decades ago. My family history… my father had high blood pressure, and my mother had some arthritis. Nothing really serious, as far as I know. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially. Does that help? And… is a CT scan something to be worried about?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, thank you. No major illnesses or surgeries, pneumonia as a child, family history of hypertension and arthritis – good to know. And no smoking or heavy drinking – excellent habits. As for the CT scan, it's a standard imaging procedure. It uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of your abdomen and pelvis. It’s generally very safe, although there is some exposure to radiation. The benefits of getting a clear diagnosis in this case outweigh the risks. It's not something to be alarmed about, but it's understandable to be a little anxious. We'll take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I take a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. And, just to be clear, is contrast dye usually involved in a CT scan of the abdomen? I've heard things about that being… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. Just a daily multivitamin – that’s good to know. And yes, a CT scan of the abdomen often involves intravenous contrast dye to help better visualize the structures. Some patients experience a warm sensation during the injection, and a metallic taste in their mouth, but it's generally well-tolerated. There is a small risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast, which is why we'll ask you some questions beforehand to assess your risk and have medications available if needed. Before we order the scan, do you have any kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never been told I have any kidney problems. I’ve always had regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and he’s never mentioned anything about my kidneys. I suppose that’s a good sign? And, if you don’t mind me asking, what are you thinking this could be? I know you probably can’t say for sure yet, but… is it something serious? I'm just trying to prepare myself, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable question, Mr. Raghunathan. It’s good that you’ve had regular check-ups. It's good to hear your primary care physician hasn't mentioned anything about your kidneys. It’s difficult to say definitively what this could be without the imaging. It could be a number of things – a benign cyst, a lipoma , or, less commonly, something more concerning. It's important not to jump to conclusions at this stage. The CT scan will give us the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis. I want to be upfront and honest with you. While it’s likely to be something benign, we need to rule out any potential concerns. Once we have the scan results, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and develop a plan of action. I’m going to order the CT scan with and without contrast. I will also write you a prescription for a mild oral laxative to help clear your bowels before the scan. This will improve the image quality. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense. I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. A laxative… alright, that’s fine. I'll make sure to take it as directed. And the scan… when can I expect to have it done? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a busy schedule, so I’m trying to plan around it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm sending the order to the radiology department now. They should contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule the scan. The scan itself typically takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, the radiologist will review the images and send a report to me. I typically receive the results within 24-72 hours of the scan. I’ll then contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
