DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I'm able to fly. It's for... well, travel insurance, mostly. They need it to cover me, and they require a doctor's note. Is that something you can do?
DOCTOR: Certainly. A fit-to-fly letter. Okay. To properly assess whether I can write that letter for you, I'll need a little more information. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I had a bad flu last winter, but I recovered completely. And… my husband passed away about a year and a half ago. That was… difficult, obviously, but physically I’m fine. I’m on Medicare, if that’s helpful. It covers my regular check-ups, and they haven’t said anything about me not being able to travel.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sayar. I'm very sorry for your loss. So, no chronic medical problems, just the flu last winter, and you’ve been cleared for regular check-ups with Medicare. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing. I haven't needed anything since… well, not for a long time. Just vitamins, occasionally, if I think I’m getting a cold. But nothing prescribed by a doctor. Is that okay? I know some people need all sorts of things, but I really don’t.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband was the one with allergies - peanuts, mostly. But I'm clear. I really don’t think there’s much to worry about, honestly. I just want to make sure I can get this letter so I can book my trip.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sayar. That’s all good information. Just to be thorough, and since this is for travel insurance, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, and I’ll listen to your breathing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, and if an exam helps, then let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 120 over 80. That’s a good, healthy reading. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Breathing sounds normal. Everything sounds good so far. Do you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness that you've experienced recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. None of those things. I feel perfectly fine, honestly. I’ve been a little stressed with planning the trip, but physically I’m feeling strong. I walk every morning, about three miles, and I haven’t had any problems with that. I really just want to get this letter and go.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I see no reason why you wouldn’t be fit to fly. I’ll go ahead and print out a letter for your insurance company confirming your ability to travel. Here you go. Does that look alright?
PATIENT: Perfect! Yes, that looks exactly what they need. Thank you so much, Doctor. That’s a relief. I really appreciate you getting this done so quickly. Is there anything else I need to do, or is this it?
DOCTOR: No, that should be it, Ms. Sayar. Just keep that letter with your travel documents. Have a wonderful trip, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before you go. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Chora. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. Enjoy your trip! Goodbye. .
