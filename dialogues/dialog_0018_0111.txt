DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Dr. Stilaire. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it's about this… discoloration. And frankly, I haven't got all day. It’s been… troubling. A darkening of the skin, you see, and I feel terribly fatigued. It's simply unacceptable. I work very hard, you understand. Reinforcing iron, not child’s play.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I understand you're concerned about this skin discoloration and fatigue, and that your time is valuable. We will get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this discoloration?
PATIENT: It's… darker. My skin. Naturally, it's always been a healthy tone, but now it’s… different. A sort of brownish hue, I suppose. It's most noticeable on my hands, I believe, and perhaps my face. I don't spend much time looking at myself, you understand. Very busy man. It came on gradually. Honestly, I can’t pinpoint when exactly. Time blurs, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does indeed, Mr. Drahota. And it's perfectly alright if you can't pinpoint the exact start date. "Gradually" is helpful information. Could you describe where specifically on your hands and face you've noticed this change?
PATIENT: Mostly… the backs of my hands. And around the knuckles, perhaps. A slight… muddiness, wouldn't you say? And on my face… well, around the forehead, I think. And… oh, and my cheeks. A bit blotchy, perhaps. Though my wife says I look the same. Women don’t notice these things, you understand. They’re focused on… other matters. Really, it’s quite bothersome. Interferes with my appearance, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate you describing it so thoroughly. Blotchy around the forehead and cheeks, and on the backs of your hands and knuckles… that is helpful. Now, has this discoloration been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? What do you mean? I told you about the fatigue, didn’t I? That is a change. A very unwelcome one. Other than that… hmm. Well, my appetite hasn't been quite what it used to be. But honestly, who has a good appetite these days? The food isn’t what it once was. I don't think so. Perhaps a bit more… lethargic. But I'm an older man. One expects a certain… slowing down. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is exactly what I am asking, Mr. Drahota – thank you for clarifying. Reduced appetite and increased lethargy, alongside the fatigue. I want to be as thorough as possible. Now, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you may have had?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… good heavens. That’s a question. Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea. I’ve always been a very healthy man. Worked hard all my life. Never much time for doctors, you understand. A bit of a cold now and then, perhaps. A touch of indigestion. Nothing serious. My wife handles all those matters. She… keeps the records, you see. I simply don’t bother. Frankly, it's all rather… unpleasant. I believe I had my vaccinations, of course. When they told us to. But beyond that… I couldn't possibly say.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. It’s alright if you don't have a detailed medical history readily available. We can work with what we have. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. No, no, I don't believe so. Certainly nothing major. I may have spent a night once, many years ago, with a particularly nasty bout of… the flu, perhaps. But it was hardly a hospital visit. More of a… precautionary measure. My wife insisted. She worries excessively, you understand. As for surgeries… no, I haven’t had any surgeries. Definitely not. I've always prided myself on my physical resilience. A strong constitution, you see. No need for cutting and poking.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Drahota. No significant surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly, it's a long story. And not a particularly interesting one. My father was… a hardworking man, as was his father before him. Mostly farmers, I believe. And my mother… she passed away a long time ago. I don't recall any… specific illnesses. Perhaps a bit of… arthritis, in her later years. But nothing significant. We weren’t a family that… discussed these matters. Too preoccupied with… getting on with things, you understand. No one died young, if that's what you're asking. Just… a gradual decline. Really, it’s all rather vague. And frankly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with my discoloration.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I assure you I’m asking these questions to build a complete picture of your health. Sometimes family history can offer important clues, but we can certainly proceed without specific details if that's all you have. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I am a man of moderation and discipline. I do enjoy a cup of tea with my dinner, perhaps, but that is hardly a vice. Smoking? Drinking? Recreational drugs? The very suggestion is… appalling. I've never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and I certainly wouldn't dream of… indulging in such behavior. I’m a responsible member of society, you understand. I spend my days working, providing for my family. I have no time for… frivolities. Really, I find the question rather… insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was insensitive, Mr. Drahota. It was merely a standard part of my assessment, and I assure you I did not intend to offend. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely none. I pride myself on my natural health. I do not believe in poisoning my body with artificial chemicals. No pills, no potions, no supplements. I eat a balanced diet, get plenty of rest… well, as much rest as an old man can get. And I drink my tea, as I mentioned before. That is the extent of my… “medication,” if you want to call it that. My wife occasionally tries to slip me something for my… joints, perhaps, but I always refuse. I prefer to rely on my own resilience. Really, I find the entire concept of modern medicine rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Drahota. No medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none whatsoever. I’ve eaten everything imaginable throughout my life – various cuisines, exotic fruits, unusual meats… Never a problem. I’m a remarkably robust individual, as I’ve said before. A strong digestive system, you understand. No sensitivities, no reactions, no rashes, no swelling… Nothing. My wife occasionally worries about shellfish, but that's just her being… overly cautious. Really, I can’t imagine being allergic to anything. It seems rather… improbable. A man of my constitution simply doesn’t have allergies.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Drahota. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Drahota, thank you for providing me with this information. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination, if that is agreeable to you. This will allow me to further assess your condition and hopefully determine the cause of your skin discoloration and fatigue. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick about it. As I mentioned before, my time is valuable. And I do hope you can provide me with some sort of diagnosis. Simply examining me won’t solve anything, you understand. I expect results. And I trust you are a competent physician.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I will be as efficient as possible and I assure you I will do my best to determine the cause of your symptoms. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Pulse and temperature are normal. Now, if you’ll please roll up your sleeves, I’d like to examine your skin more closely. I note some mild dryness to the skin on your hands and slight tenderness upon palpation of the forearms. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Now, could you please open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Really, I don’t see what examining my throat has to do with my skin. It’s all rather… haphazard, wouldn't you say? I trust you’re not planning on prescribing me some sort of… sugary cough syrup. I’m not a child, you understand.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear and healthy. This was just a standard part of the examination to rule out any underlying issues. Your heart sounds are regular with no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezes or crackles. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Please, relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Alright, Mr. Drahota, that completes the physical examination. I’ll need to order some blood work to help determine the cause of your skin discoloration and fatigue. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, liver function tests, and thyroid function. I will also include a Vitamin D level. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood work… Of course. More waiting, more poking and prodding. Honestly, the inconvenience of it all. Very well. Do what you must. But I trust your laboratory has a reasonably comfortable waiting room? And I expect the results promptly. I haven’t got all day, you understand. And please, try to explain things in simple terms. I don't have a medical degree. Is there anything else you require?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. I will ensure the lab is aware of your concerns and do my best to expedite the results. I will certainly explain everything in a clear and concise manner, avoiding any unnecessary medical jargon. For now, I would like to order these tests and schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately one week, once the results are available. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week… very well. Though I must say, it seems a rather long time to wait for a simple diagnosis. But if that is the timeframe, then so be it. One week. Schedule the appointment, then. But please, try to accommodate my schedule. I have… commitments, you understand. And ensure the waiting room is comfortable. These are non-negotiable. Really, I expect a certain level of courtesy and efficiency. Now, if you'll excuse me… I believe I’ve wasted enough time here today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I will do my best to accommodate your schedule and ensure a comfortable experience at the lab. I have scheduled your follow-up appointment for August 9th at 10:00 AM. Here is the requisition form for your blood work. Please take this to the lab at your earliest convenience. The lab is located at [insert hypothetical lab address and contact information]. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Drahota. I look forward to reviewing the results with you next week.
PATIENT: Very well. Good day. .
