DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here because I am looking into a senior living facility. They asked me to get cleared by a doctor first, to make sure I am fit for it. A simple check-up, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. A pre-admission physical is a very common and good idea. It helps ensure the facility can meet your needs and that the transition is as smooth as possible. So, just to start, let’s go over a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I see Doctor Miller back in Rapid City. He’s been my doctor for…oh, let me think… nearly fifteen years now, I believe. A good man. We mostly just talk about aches and pains, to be honest. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It’s helpful to have that continuity of care. Do you mind if I request your records from Dr. Miller?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please do. He keeps very good notes, I’m sure. I wouldn't want to repeat myself unnecessarily. It’s been a while since I’ve had to fill out those forms, my memory isn’t what it once was, though I remember details quite well. It’s the names and dates that sometimes slip away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Tkac. It’s very common. We can definitely get those records and save you the trouble. While we wait for those to come through, let’s talk a little bit about what’s been going on right now. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – anything that’s bothering you at all?
PATIENT: Well, my knees ache, especially when the weather is damp. And sometimes, I feel a little… unsteady on my feet. Not falling, mind you, just a bit wobbly. It doesn’t happen often, but enough to notice. My eyesight isn't what it used to be either, I need glasses to read and see things clearly at a distance. Nothing new, though. I’ve had those issues for some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so knee pain with damp weather, occasional unsteadiness, and vision changes that you’ve been aware of for a while. Let's focus on that unsteadiness for a moment. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s not a spinning feeling, Doctor, not dizziness exactly. More like… my legs feel weak, momentarily. Like they might give way. It usually happens when I stand up quickly, or if I’m walking and get distracted. It doesn’t last long, just a second or two, and I can usually steady myself. But it makes me cautious, I suppose. I don't want to risk a fall. It doesn't happen every day, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know – it sounds like it's more of a weakness than true dizziness. And it's related to quick movements or distraction. Do you notice it happening more frequently recently, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… maybe a little more lately. Not a lot more, but I’ve noticed it a couple of extra times in the past month or so. It could be the heat, perhaps. It makes everything feel a bit sluggish, you know? And I've been walking more, trying to stay active. Maybe that’s it. It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible increase in frequency recently, perhaps related to the heat or increased activity. We should check your blood pressure both sitting and standing to rule out something called orthostatic hypotension – that’s when your blood pressure drops when you stand up, which can cause that feeling of weakness and unsteadiness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help figure things out, I am happy to have my blood pressure checked. I don't mind at all. I trust your judgement. I've always believed in listening to what the doctors say.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for a moment, I'll take your blood pressure while you're seated. Then I'll have you stand up, and we'll check it again after a few minutes. It’s a quick and simple test. Would you mind telling me which arm you prefer I use?
PATIENT: No, not at all. You can use my left arm, please. It's always been a bit easier for them to get a reading there. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts me at ease, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac, just relax your arm… and breathe normally. Okay, seated blood pressure is 142/88. Not too bad, but a little elevated. Now, if you would, slowly stand up when you’re ready. Okay, standing blood pressure is 128/76. That's a drop of about 14 points in the systolic pressure, which is something we want to take note of. Do you feel any dizziness or lightheadedness when I took your blood pressure standing up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I didn’t feel any dizziness or lightheadedness. A little unsteady, perhaps, as usual, but nothing more than I normally experience. It wasn’t anything dramatic. Just a bit wobbly for a second or two, then it passed. I’ve been quite fortunate, all things considered. I recover quickly. But I appreciate you checking all the same. It's good to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's reassuring. A slight drop in blood pressure with a change in position, but without any significant symptoms. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I take one prescription. It’s for my arthritis, called Meloxicam. Just one pill, every day. And sometimes, when my knees are particularly sore, I’ll take some ibuprofen, over-the-counter. Nothing else, really. No vitamins, no herbal remedies, nothing like that. I prefer to keep things simple. And I try to stay active, that helps more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Meloxicam daily for arthritis, and ibuprofen as needed. Do you know the dosage of the ibuprofen you usually take?
PATIENT: Let me think... usually 200 milligrams, Doctor. Two pills, when I need them. I try not to take them too often, though. I read somewhere that too much ibuprofen isn't good for your stomach. I believe it was in the newspaper. A good article it was, too. I've always tried to be careful with medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, 200 milligrams of ibuprofen as needed. That’s good you’re mindful of that potential side effect. Now, one last thing before we move on to a brief physical exam. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a very practical woman. I can eat anything, take most medicines, and sleep anywhere. I’ve been quite lucky, all things considered. A simple life, I suppose. But a good one.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Tkac, that gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I understand it's all part of making sure I'm fit for the senior living facility. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I've never been afraid of a doctor's examination. A sensible precaution, I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tkac, just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Okay, your gait is a little unsteady, as you mentioned, but stable. No significant deficits. Overall, your neurological exam is within normal limits for your age, but we should keep an eye on that unsteadiness. Now, based on what you’ve told me and my examination, I think we’ve got a good picture.
PATIENT: That’s reassuring to hear, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. It's good to know everything is within normal limits, even with the little wobbles. So, what do you think? Am I fit enough for the facility? I'm eager to move forward, if possible. It would be a great relief to know I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tkac. Based on my assessment, and keeping in mind your age and the occasional unsteadiness, I believe you are generally fit for assisted living. However, there are a few things we need to address. The drop in blood pressure when you stand up, while not causing immediate symptoms, is something we should monitor and potentially manage with some lifestyle modifications, like drinking plenty of fluids and standing up slowly. And we should continue to be mindful of that unsteadiness. To be completely thorough, I recommend a baseline EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, just as a precaution. And I’d like you to have a consultation with a physical therapist for a gait assessment and to develop some exercises to improve your balance and strength. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I completely understand the need for precautions. An EKG and a physical therapist… I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. I want to be as prepared as possible. Drinking more fluids and standing up slowly… those are easy enough changes to make. I appreciate you being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease, knowing we’re taking all the necessary steps. And I'm glad to hear I am generally fit, that's very encouraging. So, what do we do first?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, first, I’ll write an order for the EKG. We can get that done here in the clinic today. It only takes a few minutes. While you’re waiting, I'll also get a referral to a physical therapist. I have a good one nearby who specializes in geriatric care. I’ll have her office contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also send a summary of our consultation, including the EKG and PT referral, to Dr. Miller, your primary care physician, so he’s aware of everything we discussed. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially in this heat. And when you stand up from a seated position, do it slowly, pausing for a moment before taking your first step. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds like a perfect plan. An EKG today, a referral to the physical therapist, and a summary to Dr. Miller… I appreciate your efficiency. I'll be sure to drink more water and stand up slowly. You've put my mind at ease considerably. I feel much more confident about moving forward with the senior living facility now. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of before I leave? Or should I simply wait for the EKG and expect a call from the physical therapist?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tkac, I think that covers everything for today. Just wait for the EKG results, and you should be receiving a call from the physical therapist’s office within the next few days to schedule an appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as increased dizziness, falls, or chest pain. I'll print out a brief summary of our discussion for you to take home, including the recommendations for fluid intake and slow positional changes. Do you have any final questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I do. You've answered all my questions and explained everything very thoroughly. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. You've been most helpful. I’m very grateful for your time and expertise. I’ll await the EKG results and the call from the physical therapist. Thank you again, Doctor Lahn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was my pleasure to meet you and help in any way I could. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. If anything comes up, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a wonderful day, and I wish you all the best with your transition to assisted living.
