DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently. It’s not…normal for me, and it’s starting to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to bring up anything that's concerning you, and you're not alone – changes in body odor can be a sign of something worth looking into, and it’s good you’re addressing it. Can you describe what you mean by “not normal”?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve always just…smelled like me, you know? A little bit of soap, maybe. But now it’s…stronger, and kind of…sweeter, almost? Not a bad sweet, but definitely different. And it seems to happen even when I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. I usually don’t sweat much, and I definitely don’t smell like this normally. I've been using the same deodorant for years, too, so I don’t think it’s that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A change in the type of odor, and the fact that it’s happening even with minimal activity… those are important details. And you haven’t changed anything recently – new soaps, lotions, detergents, diet?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Everything is the same as always, really. Same soap, same laundry detergent, same foods. I haven’t started any new medications either. It just…started, maybe a month ago? I'm trying to think…around the first week of July, I think. It’s been gradually getting more noticeable since then. I haven’t been traveling anywhere, either, so it’s not like I picked something up on a trip.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… not really. I’ve felt fine, generally. No fever, no weight loss, no changes in my bathroom habits… I've been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? But that’s not new, and I just figured it was the heat. No skin changes, no unusual rashes… Nothing else that I can think of, really. Just the smell. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. No other associated symptoms is good to know. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that, nothing major. I see my primary care doctor regularly for check-ups, and everything has always been fine. I’m on Medicare, so they keep pretty good track of things. Do you need to know what medication I take for the blood pressure? I can tell you if you want.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. Knowing what medications you're currently taking is important. Also, have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Okay, let’s see. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for the blood pressure. And… that’s it. Just the lisinopril. As for surgeries… hmm. No, just the gallbladder. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that didn’t require surgery, just a cast. And I’ve had the usual things, like wisdom teeth removed, but that’s about it. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. I do a lot of walking, you know, with my job. It keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Walking is excellent. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father had heart problems, but he didn't take very good care of himself. He smoked, you know? And drank a lot. My sister has high cholesterol, but other than that, not really. Nothing major that I know of. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history, honestly. They passed away a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful information. Just trying to get a complete picture. Finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I’ve never smoked. And I don’t drink alcohol, not at all. Never really appealed to me. I prefer tea, if I'm having a drink at all. And I eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables, lean protein… I try to avoid processed foods as much as possible. I'm a floor layer, you know? Gotta have energy for the job! It's hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful, Kerriann. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. I'll also check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I’m ready whenever you are. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s good to know someone is taking this seriously. It’s just… it’s hard to explain a smell, you know? I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It is hard to describe a smell, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin is intact, no rashes or lesions noted. No unusual discoloration. I don't note any visible areas of concern.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s…reassuring, at least. So what do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Kerriann. The good news is, everything appears normal on the physical exam. However, a change in body odor can have several causes, and it's important to investigate further. One possibility is bromhidrosis, which is essentially an altered body odor due to changes in sweat composition. This can sometimes be caused by bacteria interacting with sweat. Another, less common, possibility is a metabolic issue, although your other symptoms don’t strongly suggest that. To rule things out, I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel will give us a good baseline. I also want to check your thyroid levels, as thyroid issues can sometimes affect body odor. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. If that’s what you think is best, I trust your judgment. Blood tests are fine. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s unsettling to not know. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It helps to understand what you’re looking for. Will I need to fast before the blood tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s my job to make sure you understand what's happening. Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is fine. We’ll get those ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in quickly. I’ll also give you a list of instructions to take with you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if the odor becomes significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms like fever, weight loss, or fatigue, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Just waiting on the results, I guess. Thank you again, Dr. Pfennig. I feel a lot better knowing we’re looking into it. I appreciate your time and your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a bit. We'll get those results back as quickly as possible, and we’ll be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here's the lab order and the fasting instructions. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
