DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, it’s good to meet you. I’m Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Chriselda, right? That’s a pretty name. Well, it’s… down there. Something’s not right. It’s… leaking. I don’t know what else to tell ya. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is often a bit awkward to talk about these things, so don’t feel embarrassed at all. “Leaking,” you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, leaking. Like… when a pipe breaks, but… smaller. And not water. It’s… yucky stuff. I noticed it a few days ago. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It smells bad too. I don’t remember doing anything to cause it, if that makes sense. Just… happened.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So, this started a few days ago, and it’s not associated with any injury or change in activity?
PATIENT: Change in activity? Hmm… Well, I been painting more lately. Outside, in the sun. Does that count? I been tryin’ to finish a big mural for the village fiesta. Lots of standing, lots of… reaching. But I been paintin’ for years! Never had this problem before. Maybe it's just old age catchin’ up to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, painting outside, more standing and reaching… good to know. And you’re right, it’s helpful to rule things out. We'll try and figure this out. First, can you tell me a little more about where exactly you're noticing this leaking?
PATIENT: Well… it’s comin’ from… down there, where a man’s… part goes. I don’t know what you call it. It's on me, on my clothes. It’s not like a flood, but it’s… there. And it stinks! I keep washin’ myself, but it keeps comin’ back. I ain’t been with anyone for a long time, so it’s not from that, if that’s what you’re thinkin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so open with me, Jimmi. It sounds like this is really bothering you, and we'll get to the bottom of it. Just to clarify, when you say “down there,” are you referring to the vaginal area?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Is that what they call it now? Maybe. It’s… the hole. The one babies come out of. I had babies a long, long time ago. Lots of years ago. It’s all kinda blurry now, you know? I just know somethin’s not right in there. And it smells like old fish. Really, really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. It sounds like we're talking about vaginal discharge. And you're right to be concerned about a change in smell, especially describing it as "fishy." That can be a sign of an infection. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the discharge?
PATIENT: Infection? Oh dear. No… not really. Just the smell. And the leakin’. It kinda burns a little when I… wash it. Not all the time, just sometimes. And I been feelin’ kinda tired lately, but I’m old! Everybody gets tired when they get old. I don’t know if that’s related or not. Everything hurts a little these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some burning with washing and feeling tired… We’ll keep those in mind. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let me think… Oh, I had the flu once, a bad one. And my knees bother me somethin’ awful. Arthritis, the doctor said. And I had my babies, of course. C-sections, both of them. Oh! And I used to get boils, when I was younger. Real painful ones. But that was a long time ago. I don’t remember much else, to be honest. I haven't been to a doctor in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, flu, arthritis, two C-sections, and boils in the past. And you haven't been to a doctor in years, alright. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I can eat anything. I like spicy food, sometimes it makes me sweat, but that's not an allergy, is it? I don't take any pills or nothin’. I don't like all them chemicals. My mama always said natural is best. I use coconut oil for everything. Helps with the skin. Maybe I should put some on that, you know… down there? Would that help?
DOCTOR: Coconut oil might be soothing, but let's hold off on that for now, Jimmi. We need to figure out what's going on first. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, no pills. Not even aspirin. I don't believe in all that stuff. My mama always made teas for everything. Ginger for my tummy, chamomile for sleepin’. But I haven’t made any teas lately. Too hot outside. Just coconut oil and water. That’s all I need. And maybe some papaya sometimes. It’s good for digestion, my mama said. Honestly, doctor, I just want this smell to go away. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just coconut oil, water, and occasionally papaya. I understand your main concern is the smell, and we’ll definitely address that. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just involve me looking at the area and possibly taking a small sample to send to the lab. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam? Well… I don’t know. I haven’t had one of those in… well, a long time. Is it gonna hurt? I’m an old woman, doctor. Everything creaks and groans. I don't like people touchin' down there. It's kinda… private. But I want this smell gone… so maybe? But be gentle, okay? Real gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand your hesitation, Jimmi. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about an exam, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything step-by-step, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. It won't be a long exam. It'll help me understand what might be causing the discharge and smell. We can start by just taking a look, and if we need to take a sample, I’ll walk you through that as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Just… tell me what you’re gonna do first. And be quick. And gentle. Real gentle. I don’t want any surprises. And no poking, okay? My mama always said not to let anyone poke… down there. It’s bad luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, no poking, I promise. First, I’m just going to visually examine the area. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll have you put a sheet over you, and I’ll only expose the area I need to see. I'll be wearing gloves. Then I'll take a look. It won’t take long at all. I'll tell you what I'm seeing as I go. Sound good?
PATIENT: Alright… a table, huh? Okay. But you tell me what you’re doin’ every step of the way, okay? And be quick. I don’t like lyin’ down for too long. Makes my back ache. And you remember what my mama said… no pokin’! This is kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re doing great. Just lie back and relax as much as you can. I’m going to adjust the sheet to cover you, leaving just the area I need to see exposed. I’m wearing gloves, and I'll be very gentle. Now, I’m just going to take a look at the area… I see some redness around the opening of the vagina, and there is a thin, grayish-white discharge. It does have a slightly fishy odor. No visible sores or blisters. I’m not seeing anything concerning other than the redness and discharge. I'll take a sample now to send to the lab for testing. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. Do you feel any pain when I touch your abdomen?
PATIENT: Abdomen? Not really… just old aches. You know, like when the weather changes. But if you poke too hard… yes, it hurts. Be gentle! Is that bad? What are you lookin' for down there? Is it somethin' serious? I told my mama I shouldn't have come to the doctor… she always said doctors just make things worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your worry. No poking, I promise. I’m just gently palpating your abdomen to rule out any other source of discomfort. It's a routine part of the exam. And I’m not seeing anything concerning there. The redness and discharge, along with the odor, are most likely a vaginal infection. It’s very common, Jimmi, and easily treatable. We'll send the sample to the lab to confirm the type of infection so we can prescribe the right medication. It's not serious, and we'll get it taken care of. I’m just going to use this small swab to collect a sample of the discharge… It might feel a little cold or ticklish… almost done… There. That's all. Now, we’ll send this to the lab and should have the results in a few days. I'll also check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Oh dear. Alright… alright. Just get it over with. I don’t like all these tests. But if it means gettin’ rid of the smell… okay. But don't poke! You keep sayin’ that, but I’m serious! And what kinda infection is it? Is it… catchin'? Is that why I’m smellin' like old fish?
DOCTOR: Okay, no poking, I promise. And I understand your concern about it being “catching.” It’s not a sexually transmitted infection, Jimmi. It’s most likely bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection, both of which are very common and not related to sexual activity. They’re caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but it's not severely high. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, while we wait for the lab results, I'm going to prescribe a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the area twice a day for a week. This should help to clear up the infection and get rid of the smell. I'll also recommend avoiding douching and wearing cotton underwear to allow the area to breathe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Topical cream? Cotton underwear? I always wear cotton underwear. My mama would have my hide if I didn’t. And I don’t douches. That sounds awful! But… cream? I don’t like puttin’ things on down there. Is it gonna burn? Will it smell funny? And how long will it take to work? I gotta go to the fiesta next week! I promised to help decorate. I don't want to smell like old fish at the fiesta!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. The cream is a mild antibiotic, and it shouldn't burn. Some people experience a little mild itching or irritation, but it’s usually temporary. It doesn’t have a strong smell, either. It’s a small amount and it’s designed to be gentle. Applying the cream for a week should significantly improve your symptoms and get rid of the smell before the fiesta. Here's the prescription for the cream, and these instructions have detailed information about how to apply it and what to expect. It's important to finish the entire course of treatment, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they get worse, please call my office, and we’ll reassess. And if you develop any severe itching, burning, or rash, call immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… I can barely read this tiny print! My eyes ain't what they used to be. But… okay. A week, you say? And finish the whole thing, even if it smells good already? And what if it doesn’t work? Will I have to come back here? I really don’t want to come back here. I hate all these tests and poked and prodded. Well… I guess I’ll try it. But if it doesn’t work, don’t blame me if I start usin’ coconut oil. My mama always knew best. Thank you, doctor. I think. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. I’m confident the cream will help, but if it doesn’t, we’ll explore other options. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Coconut oil is great for the skin, but it won’t treat the infection. Have a good day, Jimmi, and try not to worry too much. And enjoy the fiesta!
