DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's this… shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure how long, exactly. Things aren’t what they used to be, you know? Gets harder to hold a cup steady. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. Let’s get this over with, eh? Don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It sounds concerning that you've noticed shaking in your hands, and it's impacting your daily activities. We'll certainly look into that. When you say “a bit now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Oh, goodness. Maybe… six months? A year? It comes and goes, see? Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times… well, like trying to thread a needle with a pair of boxing gloves. I really don’t keep track of these things. Was always better with the pipes, not with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Jezik. It’s often difficult to pinpoint exact timelines. Six to twelve months is helpful information. And you mentioned it comes and goes – is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse… Stress, definitely stress. When I was still working, if there was a problem with the plant… a blockage, a pump failure… hands would start right up. And… coffee, I think. Though, who doesn't drink coffee? Used to go through a pot a day, easy. Now I just have a cup or two. Doesn't seem to help much either way, honestly. Better? Not much does, if I'm being truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress and possibly coffee seem to be factors. And it doesn’t sound like anything reliably makes it better. Have you noticed the shaking in any other parts of your body besides your hands?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… sometimes my leg feels a little jittery. Not all the time, mind you. Just… a little restless. And maybe a slight tremor in my jaw, once in a while. But it could just be my imagination. Old age does funny things to you, you know? Everything rattles a bit.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re bringing these things to my attention, Mr. Jezik. It's helpful to get a complete picture. And it's perfectly normal to experience changes as we age. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking – things like stiffness, slowness of movement, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. No, not really. Still manage to get around alright, though I do take things a bit slower these days. Stiffness… sometimes my fingers feel a bit achy in the mornings, but I just figured that was arthritis. My wife, God rest her soul, had terrible arthritis. So I just assumed it was the same. As for slowness… well, I’ve always been a deliberate man. Not one for rushing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant changes in balance, some morning finger aches you attribute to arthritis, and generally a deliberate pace. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s a long story. High blood pressure, I suppose. Had it for years. Take a pill for it, mostly keeps it under control. And a touch of diabetes, the doctor told me. But nothing major. I never really bothered with it much. Always thought doctors just wanted to sell you more pills. That’s about it, really. Nothing else I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and diabetes. Do you recall the names of the medications you take for those conditions?
PATIENT: Names… Now that’s where my memory really fails me. Little white pills, mostly. And some bigger blue ones, I think. I just take what the pharmacist gives me. Always the same ones, as far as I know. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the faintest idea what they’re called. My wife always handled all that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. It’s very common for patients to not remember medication names. We can look that up in our system using your date of birth and insurance information, if you’re comfortable with that. Do you happen to know where you usually fill your prescriptions?
PATIENT: Insurance? Oh, dear. No insurance, Doctor. Never really got around to it. Always figured I was healthy enough. And my wife… well, she had good coverage through her work. Now, as for the pharmacy… uh… it's that one on Main Street. The big one. With the drive-through. I can’t recall the name of it, exactly. It's just… the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no insurance and the pharmacy on Main Street. Thank you for that information. We can try to locate your medication list through the pharmacy if you’d like. In the meantime, let’s move on to your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Appendicitis, when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And… I had my gallbladder out, I think. Maybe. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit hazy. I don’t remember much about either one. They put you under, you wake up, and everything’s done. That’s all I recall. Nothing else, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and possible gallbladder removal. We can verify that with the pharmacy as well. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father had a weak heart, I believe. Died young, relatively speaking. And my mother… she had arthritis, terrible arthritis. Like I said. As for anything else… not really. We weren't a family that talked much about illnesses. Just… tough people, mostly. Didn't complain much. So I honestly couldn't tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with a weak heart and a mother with arthritis. That's helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated them. And I always figured they were bad for you, even before the doctors started telling everyone. No, Doctor, I’m a clean-living man, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I used to enjoy a beer with dinner now and then. A Pilsner, usually. But not much anymore. Just a glass, maybe once a week. It doesn't sit with me as well these days. Nothing to worry about, Doctor. I’m not a drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer, nothing excessive. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. Sometimes I get a bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I reckon. No, Doctor, I'm not allergic to anything. Lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Jezik. That was very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: An exam, eh? Well, I suppose so. Get it over with, then. The sooner it's done, the better. But don’t go poking around too much, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, could you please sit on the edge of the examination table and let your arms hang freely at your sides?
PATIENT: There we go. Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. But don’t expect much. I haven’t been this examined since… well, I can’t even remember when.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Just relax. Now, can you touch your nose with your right index finger?
PATIENT: Here we go… There. Did I do it? It’s a bit harder than it looks, you know. These hands aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, with your left hand. And that was good, Mr. Jezik. Now, let's try something else. Can you close your eyes and extend both arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Palms up… like this? It’s a bit difficult to keep them steady, Doctor. Feel like I’m balancing a couple of plates.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Jezik. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Here we go… slowly, now. Don’t want to fall and break a hip. One… two… three… Is that alright? It feels a bit wobbly, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Jezik. That was helpful. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. Let's see… Is that tight enough? I don't have much strength in these old hands anymore. Used to be able to crush a wrench, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Jezik. And finally, I'm just going to check your reflexes in your legs. Okay, that's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Finally. Done, then? Good. Feels like I've been poked and prodded enough for one day. So, what do you think, Doctor? Is it something serious? Or just old age catching up with me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam and your history, you are exhibiting some signs of tremor, mild weakness, and slightly unsteady gait. It's difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. Several things could be contributing to your symptoms. It could be essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition, or it could be related to the early stages of Parkinson's disease. Other possibilities include medication side effects or vitamin deficiencies. I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and rule out other potential causes. I also recommend a neurological consultation with Dr. Chen. He is a specialist and can perform more comprehensive testing to determine the cause of your tremor. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s, eh? My brother had that. Wasn't a pretty sight. Blood tests… and a specialist… Well, I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? Better to know what I’m dealing with. But the sooner we get it sorted, the better. Yes, Doctor, go ahead. Blood tests and see the specialist. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I understand. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Chen and a lab order for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go whenever it’s convenient for you. The results usually take a few days. I’ll also give you a handout with information about essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease so you can familiarize yourself with the conditions. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as difficulty with speech or balance, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. A lot to take in. No, I don’t think so. Just… what if it is Parkinson’s? What happens then? Is there anything I can do? I don't want to end up… helpless, you know?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Mr. Jezik. If it is Parkinson’s disease, there are several things we can do to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. There are medications that can help control the tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can also be very beneficial. These therapies can help improve your strength, balance, coordination, and communication skills. There are also support groups available for people with Parkinson’s disease and their families. These groups can provide emotional support and practical advice. It’s important to remember that Parkinson’s disease progresses differently in everyone. With proper management, many people with Parkinson’s disease are able to live full and active lives for many years. I’ll make sure to discuss these options with you in more detail once we have the results of the blood tests and Dr. Chen’s evaluation. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Support groups, eh? Maybe that wouldn't be a bad idea. Talking to others who understand… No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… try not to scare me too much with the results, alright? I’ve had enough shocks in my life. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I'll do my best to provide you with clear and honest information, and we'll take things one step at a time. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we'll work together to find the best course of action for you. Here are the referral and lab order. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for you once you have the results. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Jezik. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
