DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes… good morning to you too, Doctor. Chagaris, you say? A fine name. Well, it’s this… business with the, you know… going to the little boy’s room. Too often. It’s… bothersome. Especially at night. Wakes up my wife, you see. She doesn’t like that. Not one bit. It just… happens, and I have to go. Don’t remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing a frequent urge to urinate, and it's particularly disruptive at night, causing some disturbance to your wife's sleep. You mentioned it's been a gradual increase. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about how frequent is "too often"?
PATIENT: Frequent… well, it’s… more than it used to be, naturally. Used to be, I could go a good few hours, maybe even four or five, without a thought. Now? Now it feels like… every couple of hours, maybe less. And at night… oh dear. Sometimes two, three times. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. Old age, I suppose. Everything starts to go, doesn’t it? Though my wife says I’m still as stubborn as a mule.
DOCTOR: It's good to maintain a sense of humor. And while changes can be a part of aging, it's important to investigate these things to rule out any underlying causes. So, several times during the day, and two or three times at night… Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder each time you go, or do you feel like you still have to go shortly after?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question, Doctor. Let me think… Usually, it feels… mostly empty. Not a complete rush, mind you, more of a… gentle flow. But afterwards… sometimes, after I’ve finished, I get a little… urge. Not a strong one, mind you, just a feeling like there’s a bit left. And then, a little while later… back I go. It's a nuisance, truly. Not like the good old days when things were… predictable.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you’re experiencing a sense of incomplete bladder emptying, followed by frequent urges shortly after. That's helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… Well, there's… sometimes a little discomfort. Not pain, exactly, more of a… pressure. Low down, you see? And occasionally, when I start going, it’s… slow. Takes a moment to get going, if you follow me. And… oh, yes. Sometimes, I feel like I can’t… push it out all the way. Like there’s a blockage, but it’s not painful. Just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Segretto. That gives me a much clearer picture. So, to summarize, you're experiencing frequent urination, especially at night, a sense of incomplete emptying, occasional discomfort or pressure low in your abdomen, hesitancy starting the stream, and sometimes a feeling of difficulty completing urination. To get a better understanding of what might be causing this, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve checking your abdomen and, with your permission, a brief digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess your prostate and check for any abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? A digital… what was that again? Doctor, I’m not sure I appreciate… poking around. I’ve lived a good long life, you see, and haven’t had anyone… examine me like that. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't we just… try something else? Perhaps a pill? Or a… tonic? My wife makes a lovely beet juice, you know. Very healthy.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. A digital rectal exam – DRE for short – allows me to feel the size and shape of your prostate gland, which can often give us important clues about what might be causing your symptoms. It’s a fairly quick exam, and while it isn’t the most comfortable, it provides valuable information that other tests simply can't. However, you are absolutely right to ask about alternatives. Before we proceed with the exam, we could start with a urine analysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. We could also discuss your symptoms further and potentially try a medication to help relax the bladder, but without a proper assessment, it would be difficult to know if that’s the right approach. Given your age and these symptoms, it’s important to rule out a few possibilities, and the prostate is a key area to investigate. I want to assure you that I will explain every step of the exam and make sure you are as comfortable as possible. Ultimately, the decision is yours. If you’d prefer to start with the urine analysis and a more detailed discussion, we can certainly do that. Would that be preferable?
PATIENT: Hmm… a urine analysis… that sounds… less intrusive. And a discussion… well, I suppose talking never hurt anyone. I still don't like the idea of… poking around, but if you say it’s important… Perhaps the analysis first, then we’ll see. And I expect you to explain everything, Doctor. Everything. No surprises. And if it’s too uncomfortable… well, I reserve the right to stop, you understand? My wife will be furious if I come home in pain.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. That's perfectly reasonable, and I wouldn’t dream of proceeding with anything you're not comfortable with. I'll explain everything clearly at each step, and you have every right to stop at any time. Let's start with the urine analysis. I’ll give you a container, and I’ll need you to collect a sample in the restroom. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means starting to urinate, then collecting a small amount in the container mid-way through. I'll give you instructions. It's a very simple procedure. After that, we can discuss your medical history in more detail, and I'll ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. A simple urine sample, I can do that. Though I must warn you, I drink a lot of water. Old habit. It’ll probably be a rather large sample. And please, explain this “mid-stream” business carefully. I don’t want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Mr. Segretto. A large sample is no problem at all - more is always better. And don't worry about making a mess; I'll walk you through the procedure step-by-step. Here’s what we’ll do. You’ll receive this sterile container. When you're ready, simply urinate a small amount into the toilet. Then, without stopping the flow, collect about two to three ounces of urine into this container. And finally, finish urinating into the toilet as usual. It's just about getting a sample from the middle of the stream. I have a private restroom just down the hall. I'll meet you back here when you’re finished. Please let me know if you have any questions. And don’t hesitate to call out if you need assistance. Would you like me to show you the restroom now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Lead the way. My bladder is already protesting. And do remind me again about this "mid-stream" business before I get in there. My memory, you see… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. No problem at all. Come this way. Now, before you go in, let me reiterate quickly. Start to urinate into the toilet as you normally would. After a few seconds, without stopping, position the container under the stream to collect the sample. Then, finish urinating into the toilet. It’s just about catching the middle portion of the urine stream. It's important to avoid getting any of the initial or final portion in the container. Take your time, and don’t rush. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Let me know when you're finished.
PATIENT: Right, right. Start, then catch, then finish. Avoid the beginning and the end. Got it. It sounds… complicated. But I’ll try my best. Honestly, Doctor, all this fuss over a little bit of water. Still, it’s good to be thorough, I suppose.
DOCTOR:
