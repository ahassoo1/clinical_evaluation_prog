DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit hard to explain, really. My hearing… it comes and goes. And sometimes, the room just spins. It’s happened a few times now. My daughter, Lani, she’s the one who insisted I come. She worries something is seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: I see. Comes and goes, and dizziness as well. That’s good of Lani to encourage you to get it checked out. It's always best to look into things. When did you first start noticing this hearing and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… that’s a good question. It feels like… a while now. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? It’s hard to say, honestly. It comes and goes so it’s not like it’s constant. It’s just… unsettling when it happens. And my father, he used to have trouble with his balance… I don’t know if that means anything.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, don’t worry about pinpointing an exact date. Six months is helpful. And your father's history is definitely something to consider. We’ll take a thorough look. You mentioned it comes and goes… Can you describe what the hearing loss feels like when it happens?
PATIENT: It's just… muffled. Like someone turned the volume down really low, or put cotton in my ears. And it’s usually in one ear, not both. Then, after a bit – sometimes a few hours, sometimes a day – it comes back. The spinning… that happens at the same time, usually. It feels like I’m on a boat, rocking back and forth. It’s not pleasant, I can tell you that much. It makes me feel a bit sick, too.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, usually one ear, and dizziness coinciding with that… and feeling sick as well. That gives us a good starting point. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. No, not that I can recall. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything I do. It doesn't happen after loud noises, or when I’m stressed… I’ve tried to think about it, but… no. It just happens. Which is the frustrating part, really. I suppose that’s why Lani brought me in. She said I shouldn't ignore it.
DOCTOR: That’s very astute of Lani. It is important to investigate when things are unpredictable like that. Okay, let’s talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so I see doctors regularly enough. Let me see… the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but they put me on a small pill for it, and it seems to be alright now. Apart from that… I had a bit of trouble with my knee a while back, but that’s mostly settled. Nothing else… I don't think so. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is. Both for overall context, and because sometimes medications or past conditions can play a role. You said a small pill for blood pressure… do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’m terrible with names, especially pill names. I just take it every morning, like the doctor told me. It's a small, white pill, I think… but that's all I remember. I leave all that to Lani, she manages my appointments and refills. I wouldn't want to give you the wrong information. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Terasa. That's perfectly alright. It’s common to not remember medication names. We can look it up in the system. Now, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not that I can recall. Just that small white pill for my blood pressure. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but it’s not regular, just when I remember. And Lani gives me something for my bones, calcium I think, but I’m not sure if it’s a pill or a liquid… Honestly, she handles most of that too. I feel bad I can't be more precise. It's just… a lot to keep track of when you get to my age.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That’s why it's good you have Lani to help. We can review everything with her later if that's alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, pretty much. And I’ve never had any trouble with pills or anything like that. I think I’d know if I had an allergy, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would. Alright, that's helpful. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, hearing loss, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a difficult one. My father, like I mentioned, he had trouble with his balance as he got older. And my mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young, actually. As for hearing loss… I don’t recall anyone specifically having trouble with their hearing, but a lot of my family lived far away, so I didn’t see them often. It's hard to say, really. We weren't very close.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s difficult to remember everything. Alright. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always warned me about them. Nasty things, cigarettes. I always preferred a good cup of tea.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much, really. Just a little red wine. It helps me relax. But I don't drink every day, maybe two or three times a week. It's not like I have a problem with it, Doctor. Just a little treat.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. And finally, tell me a little about what you do day-to-day. What kind of work do you do, or have you done in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I used to work at the casino. I was a… a gambling service worker, I suppose you’d call it. Helping people with their machines, things like that. But I retired a few years back now. I mostly stay at home these days. I like to garden a bit, and I see my friends sometimes. Nothing too exciting, really. It's a quiet life, but it suits me. I used to be very busy, but now… I prefer things slow.
DOCTOR: That sounds nice, a quiet life can be very restful. Alright, Terasa, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, and do a few balance tests. That will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, that sounds fine. I suppose it's best to get it checked out properly. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. I’m not very good with medical things. And… don’t be surprised if I flinch a bit. It’s just… a bit unsettling, all of it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Terasa. I will be as gentle as possible. And don't worry about flinching, that's perfectly normal. I'll explain everything as I go. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear as well. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Your ear canals are clear, but there is some cerumen – earwax – present in both ears. Nothing significant, but it could potentially be contributing to your hearing issues. Now, let's do a few balance tests. I'm going to ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, I can do that. Oh dear… I don’t feel very steady. It’s… a bit difficult. There! See? I told you I’m not very good with this. It’s making me feel a bit dizzy now.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Terasa, you're doing fine. It’s very common to lose balance when your eyes are closed. And yes, I can see you are a little unsteady. Now, let’s try a simple Romberg test. Could you please put your feet together again, close your eyes, and extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… more tests? Alright. Here we go… Oh no… I can’t do it! I’m going to fall! This is awful! I’m really dizzy now, Doctor. Can we stop?
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa, that’s enough. You’re absolutely right, let’s stop. It’s clear you’re feeling very unsteady, and we don't want to push it. You're doing very well, you're not at all failing. These tests are just to help me understand what’s going on. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing vertigo. That's a sensation of spinning or dizziness, and it can be caused by a number of things. The earwax could be contributing, but the unsteadiness suggests there might be something else going on as well. Let me check your EHR to see if there are any previous notes that might be relevant.
PATIENT: Vertigo… that sounds… unpleasant. Is it serious, Doctor? And… what can we do about it? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: It's good you asked that, Terasa. Vertigo can be serious, but it’s also often caused by something relatively benign. It’s important to figure out the cause of your vertigo, and that’s what we’ll do. Okay, it looks like you had a blood pressure check six months ago, and everything was stable then. No previous notes about dizziness or hearing loss. That’s helpful. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I recommend we start with a few tests to rule out some common causes of vertigo. I’d like to order an audiometry test – that’s a hearing test – to see if there’s any hearing loss that we haven't detected yet. And I’d also like to order a Vestibular Function Test. That assesses the function of your inner ear and balance system. I'll also give you a referral to an ENT – an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist – who can do a more thorough evaluation and help us determine the best course of treatment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… and a specialist… Oh dear. It sounds like a lot. But… I suppose if it helps figure out what’s wrong, then yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. How long will it take to get these tests done? And… will they be painful? I really don't like medical things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Terasa. It does sound like a lot, but we’ll take it one step at a time. The audiometry test can usually be scheduled within a week or two. It’s a non-invasive test, you just wear headphones and listen to sounds. It’s not painful at all. The Vestibular Function Test might take a little longer to schedule, but the ENT office will let you know. The Vestibular Function Test involves some eye tracking and balance exercises, but it's generally well-tolerated. The ENT specialist will explain everything thoroughly before the test, and they’ll make sure you’re comfortable. Here’s the referral form for the ENT specialist. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. And I’ll also give you a separate form for the audiometry test. I’ll also send the results of your physical exam to both specialists. In the meantime, if your dizziness gets worse or you experience any new symptoms – like headache, fever, or vision changes – please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Headaches… vision changes… Oh dear. It sounds like there's a lot to worry about. Is there anything I can do now to help ease the dizziness? Before I see the specialist? Anything at all? I just want to feel a little bit better, Doctor. Even just for a few hours.
DOCTOR: I understand, Terasa. It’s good to ask. There are a few things you can try. First, try to avoid sudden movements. Get up slowly from a sitting or lying position. Second, make sure you’re well-hydrated. Dehydration can sometimes worsen dizziness. Third, avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can also contribute to dizziness. And finally, if you feel a dizzy spell coming on, sit down immediately in a safe place and try to focus on a fixed object. That can sometimes help reduce the sensation of spinning. Unfortunately, there’s no magic cure for dizziness, but these simple measures might help ease your symptoms until you see the specialist. I’ll also write down these instructions for you, so you have them handy. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Terasa?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s… very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very kind. I suppose I should go now. It’s been… a lot to take in. Thank you again, Doctor. I hope to feel better soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. And you take care now. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, you’ll be feeling better soon. Have a good day, and please be careful getting home.
