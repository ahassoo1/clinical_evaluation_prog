DOCTOR: Right. Kerriann Purtee, 49 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s kinda embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in how I smell. My body odor, you know? It’s…different. It used to be pretty neutral, or just a normal sweat smell when I’m working, but now it’s…stronger, and not in a good way. I don’t know how else to explain it. It started maybe a month ago?
DOCTOR: A change in body odor…Yes, alright. A month ago, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly a month. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but that feels right. And it's not just after working, like it used to be. Sometimes it's there even when I haven’t done anything strenuous. I’ve tried different deodorants, stronger ones, but nothing seems to really help. I even tried those clinical-strength ones. It's just…persistent.
DOCTOR: Different deodorants…clinical strength…Okay. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really. I mean, no fever, no weight loss, nothing like that. Just the smell. I have been a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just from the work, you know? It’s pretty physical, laying floors all day. And, oh! My skin has been a bit itchier than usual, but I thought it was just from the dust. I’m always getting dust on my hands, even with gloves.
DOCTOR: Physical labor, dust exposure…itchiness… Are you experiencing any changes in your diet, or have you started any new medications recently?
PATIENT: No changes in my diet, not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have – lots of veggies, some chicken or fish, injera when I can get it. And no new medications. Just a multivitamin, but I’ve been taking that for years. I’m really stumped, to be honest. I don't feel sick, just…smelly. It's embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not food, not plants, nothing. My mother always said I was a pretty hardy kid. She used to say I could eat anything and be fine. No hives, no swelling, nothing. I haven't had any trouble with that, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Just change into this gown, and we’ll get started. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: ...Alright. Let's see. Skin exam first, then auscultation. Come on in when you're ready.
PATIENT: Okay, all set. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Again…deep breath… and out. Deep breaths… Yes… and out… Sounds normal. Now, let me take a look at your skin. Please lift your arms for me. Any rashes, sores, or unusual discoloration here?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I've noticed. Just…normal skin, I guess. A little dry sometimes, from the dust, but no rashes or anything like that. I do get a bit of dust under my sleeves sometimes, even with the gloves, so it can get itchy. But nothing red or bumpy. Just…dry.
DOCTOR: Okay. No obvious rashes or lesions…Skin appears generally dry, as you mentioned. Let me check your lymph nodes. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little…sensitive, under my armpits, but not painful. Just…I can feel them, I guess. I don't usually pay attention to them, so I don’t know if that’s normal or not. I hope everything’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lymph nodes are slightly palpable, but not significantly enlarged or tender. Given the change in body odor, the itchiness, and the slightly palpable lymph nodes, I'm considering a few possibilities. It could be a minor skin infection, a reaction to something you're exposed to at work, or – less likely, but we need to rule it out – a metabolic issue. I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We will also want to rule out kidney and liver problems. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood work sounds good. Whatever you think is best to figure it out, I’m happy to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this. So, a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a thyroid test, plus checking my kidneys and liver? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. I’ll put in the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue practicing good hygiene. And try to avoid anything that might be irritating your skin. Here's the lab order. They’ll need this at the front desk. If the smell becomes significantly worse or you develop a fever or other symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything. Just…thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and taking this seriously. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but I’m glad we’re getting it checked out. I’ll go down to the lab now, then. And I'll schedule a follow-up when I can. I appreciate it again, Dr. Sink.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Get well soon. Next patient. .
