DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... good morning. I think... the lady on the phone said something about... learning? I don't really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. He worries too much. Is this... about my back? It sometimes hurts when I bend.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. It seems your husband scheduled this appointment with some concerns regarding your back pain. He mentioned something about learning more about possible causes and management. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Management? What kind of management? Like... with money? My husband handles all that. I just... work with the metal. It's heavy, you know? Bending and lifting all day. Makes your back ache. I don’t need a lesson in… finances. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: No, no, not finances at all! My apologies for the confusion. By “management” I mean how we can best handle your back pain – things like exercises, stretches, or maybe other treatments to help it feel better. We're trying to figure out how to make your work less painful. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh. That management. Okay, good. I thought... never mind. The pain... it's mostly in my lower back. It gets worse at the end of the day, of course. And sometimes, when I wake up. It’s just… a dull ache, usually. Not sharp. Unless I try to lift something really heavy. Then it’s a different story. My husband says I shouldn't lift so much. He's always saying something.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that worsens throughout the day and in the mornings, a dull ache usually, but sharper with heavy lifting. And your husband is concerned about the lifting. That’s good he's looking out for you. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm... when did it start? That's... difficult. It’s been a long time. Probably... a few years, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s never been really bad, just… annoying. I take some pills sometimes. The red ones. My husband buys them. I don’t know what they’re called. They help a little, I think. But I don't want to rely on pills forever, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few years of intermittent pain, and you've been taking red pills purchased by your husband for relief. That’s helpful to know. Do you remember when you typically take these red pills – only when the pain is bad, or regularly?
PATIENT: Only when it’s bad. Definitely. I don't take them every day. Just... when I can't stand it anymore. Like, if I have to move a lot of metal, or bend down a lot. Then I’ll take one or two. Sometimes three, if it’s a really bad day. But I try not to. My husband says too many are bad for you. I don't really understand all that doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take the red pills as needed for pain, usually with heavier work. Your husband is right to be cautious – any medication can have side effects, and it’s good to use the lowest dose necessary. To get a better understanding of what might be causing the pain, could you tell me a bit about your work?
PATIENT: My work? I... I work with sheet metal. It’s heavy. Cutting it, bending it, shaping it. Lots of lifting. And standing. All day. It’s not a fancy job, but it pays the bills. My husband used to work with metal too, but his back got bad, that’s why he stopped. He says I should find something easier, but... what else would I do? I don’t know anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sheet metal work – heavy lifting, bending, standing for long periods. It sounds physically demanding, and I understand it's what you do to support your family. It’s good that you're aware of the strain it puts on your back. Now, besides your back, have you noticed any pain, numbness, or tingling in your legs, feet, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm... tingling? No, not really. My feet are always tired at the end of the day, from standing so much. But not... tingling. Sometimes my legs ache a little, but that’s probably just from being on them all day. And I get headaches sometimes. But those are probably from the stress. My boss is always yelling. No tingling though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired feet and occasional leg aches, headaches related to stress, but no tingling or numbness. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? Will it hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded. My husband always takes me to the doctor, and they always want to do things... I just want to learn how to not hurt so much, that's all. Is that what this appointment is for?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Airam. It won’t be anything painful, I promise. It’s a very basic exam - I’ll just check your posture, range of motion, and reflexes to see how your back is functioning. It's to help me understand where the pain is coming from, not to cause you any discomfort. I’ll explain everything as I go. We’re aiming to find the best way to manage your pain, just like you said. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay... if it's not painful. And you’ll explain everything? My husband always says I should listen to the doctor. But he's not here. Fine. But be gentle. And no poking! Just... look at it. Don't touch too much. Where do you want me to stand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, gentle is the priority. And I promise, minimal touching. We'll start with you standing. If you could just stand normally, relaxed, I’ll take a look at your posture from behind. No need to force anything. Just stand as you normally would, and I’ll have a look. Then we can move on from there.
PATIENT: Okay... Is this okay? Should I put my arms down? I never know what to do at these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Just stand as naturally as possible. Arms relaxed by your side is great. I'm just looking at how your spine naturally curves. I see a slight forward curve in your lower back, which is normal. However, there seems to be some tightness in the muscles on your left side. Now, could you gently bend forward, as if trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch! That's... not very comfortable. I can't really go much further. My back feels tight. See? Told you it was tight. It always feels like something is pulling on it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. That’s good information. It appears there's some restriction in your range of motion, and you’re right, it does feel tight. I'm noting that in your chart. Now, can you gently bend backward, just as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Backward? That feels even worse. I don't think I can. My husband always says I shouldn't overdo it. I think I pulled something last week, when I was lifting a big sheet of metal. It didn’t feel right. Nope. That’s as far as I can go. It’s like something is blocking me. It hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That's helpful. You’re right, there’s definite discomfort with both bending forward and backward. I'm noting the limitation and pain levels. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your back to assess tenderness. Please let me know immediately if anything is particularly painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Press? You’re going to press on my back? What if it hurts really bad? My husband says I have sensitive nerves. Just be… gentle. Very gentle. And stop if I say anything. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Very gentle, and I will stop immediately if you feel any pain. I’m going to start with light pressure on the muscles along your spine. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Okay, how about here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! That one! That hurts. Right there. It’s like a knot. And it feels… warm. No, not warm, but… sensitive. Stop pressing there! You’re poking the sore spot!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I apologize for the discomfort. That spot is definitely tender. It sounds like there may be some muscle spasm in that area. Now, to complete the exam, I would like to check your reflexes and your strength in your legs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Strength? What does that have to do with my back? My husband always says doctors want to do too many tests. Are you sure you need to do all this? I just want to know how to make the pain stop. Is this going to take much longer? I have to get home and make dinner. My husband doesn’t like to wait.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Airam. Checking your reflexes and strength helps me rule out any nerve involvement that might be contributing to the pain. It’s a quick assessment, and it will give me a more complete picture. It shouldn't take too much longer, I promise. Perhaps we can just do a quick check of your strength, and then we can discuss a plan to manage your pain?
PATIENT: Fine. Strength. Just... don't make me lift anything heavy. And be quick about it. My husband is going to be wondering where I am. He gets worried, you know. He's always saying I should be careful. What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Thank you. We’ll start with something simple. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. I'm sitting. Be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know. My husband says I need more calcium.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, could you please try to lift your right leg straight up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… not very easy. It feels tight. Like it's stuck. I can't lift it very high. See? It feels like I pulled something. I knew I shouldn’t have come.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I see some difficulty with lifting your leg. It does seem like there's some weakness and tightness there. Now, could you please repeat that with your left leg?
PATIENT: Ouch! Definitely harder on this side. It feels… worse. I can barely lift it at all. This is ridiculous. My husband is going to be furious if I pull a muscle. I told you I shouldn’t have come. This is just making things worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It does seem there is definite weakness and discomfort on both sides, and slightly more on your left. Alright, Airam. That concludes the physical exam. Let’s discuss a plan to address your back pain. It appears you have muscle strain and tightness, and we need to figure out how to best manage the discomfort and prevent it from worsening. Do you have any questions for me before we get into that?
PATIENT: A plan? What kind of plan? More poking and prodding? Will it involve a lot of expensive tests? My husband is on a fixed income, you know. And what about the pain? Can you make it stop? That's all I really want. Can you just give me something to make it stop?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we’ll focus on a plan that’s affordable and effective. I'm not recommending any expensive tests at this time. The goal is to manage your pain and prevent it from worsening, not necessarily to find a single "fix." I can certainly discuss options for pain relief, including medication. However, it’s important to remember that medication is often just a temporary solution. We also need to focus on long-term strategies like exercise, stretching, and proper body mechanics. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Exercise? Stretching? I work with metal all day! When am I supposed to find time for that? And proper body… what? That sounds complicated. I just want something to take the pain away. My husband says I should try heat packs, but they never really help. Just tell me what pills I can take. That's all I want. What's the strongest one you can give me? And will it make me sleepy? I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Airam. It’s completely reasonable to want a quick solution to the pain. However, I have some concerns about prescribing a strong medication right away, as those can have side effects and may not address the underlying cause of the pain. We do need to be careful. First, let's talk about what medication options we do have. I can prescribe a mild pain reliever and muscle relaxant to help ease the discomfort. However, those are best used in combination with other strategies, like heat packs – which you’ve tried - but perhaps with some gentle stretching exercises. I also want to discuss the importance of proper body mechanics – that simply means learning how to lift and move correctly to protect your back. We can discuss some simple techniques you can use at work. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Techniques? More things to remember? I just want to be able to work without feeling like my back is going to break. Okay, fine. A mild pain reliever. But nothing that makes me sleepy. And no techniques. I don’t have time for that. Just the pills. And can you write it down? My husband likes to read things. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Airam. I can certainly prescribe a mild pain reliever that shouldn’t cause significant drowsiness. I’m also going to recommend a topical cream you can apply to your lower back for added relief. I’ll also write down some basic instructions on how to use the medication and cream, and I’ll highlight the importance of avoiding heavy lifting whenever possible. I understand that’s difficult with your job, but even small changes can make a difference. This should help ease the pain, and I encourage you to try to incorporate some gentle stretches when you have a moment. If the pain doesn't improve within a week, or if it gets worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can explore other options. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: A week? That's a long time to be in pain. And stretches? I'll try... I guess. My husband will be happy I’m getting something for it. He always says I should listen to the doctor. No, I think that’s all. Just the pills. Thank you, Doctor. I hope they work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Airam. I hope they provide some relief. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
