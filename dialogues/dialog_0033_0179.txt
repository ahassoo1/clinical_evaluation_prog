DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a difficulty with the words. Yes. They do not… come so easily now. It is frustrating, you understand? I forget what I want to say, mid-sentence, sometimes. It has been happening for… a little while, I think.
DOCTOR: A little while. Right. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. Hmm. It is not… sudden. It has come on slowly. Perhaps six months? Or is it longer? It is hard to say, truly. It is not all the words, you see. Just… the important ones. When I try to explain something… or recall a name… it is the trouble. It does not happen when I am… thinking to myself, usually. Just… when I speak.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it's primarily an issue with expressive language – finding the words when you speak. And it’s been gradual onset over roughly six months. Do you notice it's worse in certain situations?
PATIENT: Worse… yes, perhaps. When I am… tired, it is definitely worse. And… if I am anxious. Thinking about what I need to say makes it… more difficult. It is a strange thing. I work with… numbers and… things like benefits. So, I need to be precise. It is… concerning. I do not know if that helps you, Doctor. I am sorry if I am… rambling.
DOCTOR: It's… information. Fatigue and anxiety exacerbate it. Alright. Let’s go through some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. I had… a problem with my heart, some years ago. They fixed it with a… a procedure. I take some medicine for that, still. And… my blood pressure is a little high, sometimes. Nothing too serious, the doctors said. Oh! And I wear glasses, as you can see. Is that what you mean? I apologize, I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: A cardiac procedure... and hypertension. I'll make a note of that. What medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I have… a little bag at home with them. I can tell you the names, but perhaps not what they do. There is one for the heart, a small white pill. And a blue one for the pressure. Oh, and… a vitamin D, the doctor suggested it. I believe that is all. I take them every morning, with my breakfast. I am sorry for being so vague. It is… difficult to recall these details.
DOCTOR: Right. We can get the full list from the pharmacy. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not think so. Nothing that I am aware of, at least. I have never had a… a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. Perhaps a little… itchy eyes in the spring, with the pollen, but nothing serious. No medicines, no foods… I believe I am alright in that regard. It is good to ask, though. You must ask, yes? I appreciate you being thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history – any neurological or psychiatric conditions in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Neurological… psychiatric… hmm. That is… a difficult question. My wife… she passed away some years ago, and she… she had some troubles with her memory, toward the end. The doctors said it was… old age, perhaps. But she was very private, and did not speak much about it. My brother… he was always… a bit anxious, like myself. Nothing that needed… treatment, though, if that makes sense. He just… worried a lot. I do not know if that is what you mean. It is… a sad topic, to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, a little about your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. No smoking, never. I do not like it. And… very little alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes, but not often. Perhaps once a week? And… absolutely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I am a simple man, you see. I prefer a quiet evening at home. It is… a peaceful life. I apologize if I am not providing… useful information. It is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Can you follow my finger without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Is this alright? I am trying to be… precise. It is sometimes difficult to focus, you understand. My eyes… they tire easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Just follow it. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Like this? Is this… too strong? Or too weak? I am not sure what you are looking for. I try to be careful, you see. I do not want to… cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you say "Hello" for me?
PATIENT: Hello. Is that… alright? It felt… strange, to say it. My voice… it did not sound right, perhaps. It is… difficult to explain. It felt as if… I had to force the word out. Is that what you are looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. It appears your cranial nerves are intact. Given your history and this brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early cognitive changes, possibly related to age or stress. However, it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. And I’d like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist… That sounds… very serious, Doctor. Is it… something to worry about? I do not understand… cognitive changes? I just forget words, sometimes. I am… a little frightened, now. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Gyamfi. We need to rule out anything serious. The forgetting of words could be a number of things, and we need to investigate further. An MRI is a non-invasive scan, and the neurologist will perform some tests to assess your cognitive function. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is bad. It's just… thoroughness. I’ll have the nurse explain the scheduling process. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thoroughness… yes. I understand. It is… a relief to hear it might not be… serious. But… what if it is something? What if… my memory gets worse? My wife… she… she forgot things, too, toward the end. I do not want… I do not want that. What kind of tests will the neurologist do? Will they… be painful? And how long will it take to get the results of the MRI? I apologize… I am asking many questions. I am just… anxious.
DOCTOR: The neurologist will likely perform a series of cognitive tests - things like recalling lists of words, solving puzzles, and assessing your ability to reason. They are not painful, Mr. Gyamfi. As for the MRI results, it usually takes a few days to a week for the radiologist to interpret them, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. I can’t speculate on what the results might be, as that would be irresponsible. My nurse will provide you with detailed instructions and answer any further logistical questions. I have other patients waiting, so I need to conclude this consultation. Do you have any urgent questions before I go?
PATIENT: Urgent… no, I do not think so. Just… Thank you, Doctor. For your time. And for… trying to explain things. It is… a lot to take in. I will speak with the nurse. .
