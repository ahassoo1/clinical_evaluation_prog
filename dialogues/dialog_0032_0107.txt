DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 35 years old. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 35. It's... my heart. It feels like it's jumping around sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. Like a little fish, maybe? Flapping. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “A little fish, flapping…” I see. That's… a vivid description, Mr. Puder. When you say it feels like it's “jumping around,” can you describe where you feel that sensation?
PATIENT: Right here. <points to the center of his chest> Mostly here. Sometimes it goes to my neck a little bit, but mostly here. It's not pain, exactly. More like... a fast beat. Really fast. And sometimes it feels like it skips a beat, then goes really fast again. It doesn't last long, usually. A few seconds, maybe a minute.
DOCTOR: A fast and irregular heartbeat, localized to the chest… and occasionally radiating to the neck. And you said it's not painful, just a sensation of a rapid, sometimes skipping beat. How often would you say this is happening, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's hard to say exactly. Not every day. Maybe... two or three times a week? Sometimes more if I'm worried about something. Or if I drink too much coffee. <chuckles lightly> My wife tells me I drink too much coffee. It doesn't happen when I'm sleeping, though. Never happens when I'm sleeping.
DOCTOR: It’s good it doesn’t occur during sleep. So, it seems to be triggered by activity or stress, and potentially caffeine intake. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? <pauses, thinking> Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just like… light. And a little bit tired, maybe. But I work long hours, so I'm usually tired. It's hard to tell if it's the heart thing or just work. No… I don't think so. I haven't noticed anything else. Oh! Sometimes my hands feel a little shaky. But that’s only when I'm really stressed.
DOCTOR: Dizziness, fatigue, and shakiness with stress… Interesting. Now, let’s go through some general health questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No high blood pressure. My wife checks sometimes. No diabetes, and no… what was the other one? Cholesterol? No, I don't think so. I've never been told I have any of those things. I try to eat okay. Not too much sugar. <shrugs> I work too hard to worry too much about what I eat, I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And… no hospital. Never been in the hospital. Not even when I was a little boy. My wife asked me that once, and I had to think really hard. Nothing. Never been in the hospital. <smiles slightly> I'm a pretty healthy guy, usually. Just this heart thing now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? My father… he had some problems with his breathing when he got older. But I don’t know what it was. He lived in Yemen, and it was hard to get good doctors. My mother, she was healthy. Very healthy. And my brothers and sisters… they’re all okay. No heart problems that I know of. Just… normal things. Old age things. Nothing like this.
DOCTOR: Breathing problems in your father… understood. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never have. My wife would kill me. <chuckles> She's very strict about that. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer sometimes on the weekend. But not every weekend. Just… sometimes. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Very well. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. No. I can eat anything. And I haven't taken any medicine in a long time. Maybe some for a headache, but nothing special. Nothing I know I'm allergic to. My wife asks me that too. She worries a lot. <smiles weakly> She's a good wife.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to assess your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's okay. Whatever you think is best. I want to find out what's going on with my heart. Yes, please. <nods eagerly> Whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Good. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. <begins auscultating the patient's chest, listening intently> Take deep, slow breaths for me, please. <listens for a full minute, occasionally asking the patient to exhale> Your heart rate is a bit elevated, even at rest. I hear no murmurs, rubs or gallops, but your rhythm is somewhat irregular. <moves to palpate the patient's pulse, noting the rate and strength> Your pulse is regular but slightly rapid. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. <takes blood pressure reading> Blood pressure is 135/85. A little elevated, but not concerning. Now, I'm going to examine your neck to feel for your thyroid and assess your carotid arteries. <palpates the patient's neck> Your thyroid feels normal. Carotid arteries have normal pulses, but I note a slight fullness. <pauses, considering> Finally, I’ll check your extremities for edema. <palpates the patient’s ankles and feet> No edema noted. <sits back down, writing on the chart> Overall, your physical exam is relatively unremarkable, however your elevated heart rate and irregular rhythm warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds... good. I mean, I hope it's nothing serious. Elevated heart rate... is that bad? I don't feel sick, really. Just… worried. What kind of investigation? Will it hurt? I don't like needles. <fidgets slightly> My wife will be very worried if I have to have a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. An elevated heart rate can indicate a variety of things, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. However, given your symptoms and the irregularity I detected, I recommend an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to assess your heart’s electrical activity. It’s a simple, non-invasive test where we place electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s rhythm. It does not involve any needles. We will also perform bloodwork. A basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count to rule out underlying medical conditions. The bloodwork will involve a needle, but it’s a quick procedure. It’s important to gather all available data to determine the cause of your symptoms. <pauses> Are you willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Okay… ECG… no needles… that sounds okay. Bloodwork… <grimaces> a needle… I guess so. If you think it’s important. My wife… she'll want me to do whatever you recommend. Just… please be quick with the needle. And… will the bloodwork tell you what’s wrong? Will it tell you why my heart is jumping around? I just want to know what’s going on. <looks pleadingly at the doctor> It scares my wife when I'm worried.
DOCTOR: Very well. The bloodwork will provide valuable information, but it's unlikely to provide a definitive answer on its own. It will help us rule out other potential causes, such as anemia, thyroid issues, or electrolyte imbalances. The ECG will give us a snapshot of your heart's rhythm at the time of the test. Together, these tests will help us determine if further investigation is needed, such as a Holter monitor to record your heart rhythm over a longer period, or a referral to a cardiologist. <pauses> I'll order the tests now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and perform the ECG. Please try to remain calm and relax. <begins typing on the computer> I understand your wife is concerned, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will try to stay calm. And… tell the nurse to be quick with the needle, please. <shivers slightly> I hate needles. My wife… she said I'm a baby. But I really don't like them. <looks anxiously towards the door> I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: I will make a note for the nurse. Now, I have several other patients waiting, Mr. Puder. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available and contact you with the findings. In the meantime, try to reduce your caffeine intake and manage your stress levels. <pauses> Do you have any questions for me before I dismiss you?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… when will I hear back from you? And… should I go to the hospital if my heart starts jumping around really bad? Like, if I feel like I'm going to… fall down? My wife worries a lot. <looks pleadingly at the doctor> She'll want to know what to do.
DOCTOR: You should expect to hear back from me within 24-48 hours, depending on how quickly the lab results return. And, yes, Mr. Puder, if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or feel like you are going to faint, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not hesitate. <pauses> I understand your wife is concerned, but it is crucial to remain calm and only seek emergency care if you are experiencing severe symptoms. <stands up> I'll have the nurse bring you the paperwork for the bloodwork and ECG. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. <stands up slowly, looking anxious> I hope it's nothing serious. <fidgets with his hands> Thank you again. <looks towards the door, waiting for the nurse>
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat in the waiting room, and the nurse will be with you shortly. <begins typing on the computer, dismissing the patient without further eye contact> .
PATIENT: .
