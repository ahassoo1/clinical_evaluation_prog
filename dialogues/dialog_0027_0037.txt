DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. Like… wheezing, my daughter said. It is not good, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble breathing and a whistling sound… wheezing, as your daughter described. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe two, three weeks now? It comes and goes. Some days it is better, some days… not so good. It is worse when I walk, I think. Or if I try to do too much in the garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, comes and goes over two to three weeks, worse with activity… Do you feel any chest pain with the wheezing, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not really. Just…tightness. Like something is squeezing my chest a little. But not pain. It is… hard to explain. And sometimes I feel very tired after. Even if I do not do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness rather than pain, and fatigue afterwards. That’s helpful. Have you had a cough at all with this, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not a bad cough, but it is there. More at night, I think. And sometimes… sometimes I wake up feeling very breathless. It scares me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand that would be frightening. Breathlessness at night is something we should definitely investigate. Have you noticed anything that makes it better, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Hmm… sitting down helps. And… my daughter gave me some tea. Herbal tea. It makes me feel a little calmer, I think. But it does not make the whistling go away, not really. Just…calmer. Is that helpful, Doctor? I am not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Sitting down helps, and the tea provides some comfort… That’s good to know. Alright. Before we proceed, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions like asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I do not think so. I have never been told I have allergies. And… asthma? COPD? I do not know what those are, Doctor. I have always been quite healthy, until recently. My husband… he had a bad heart, but I do not have heart problems. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no history of asthma or COPD. That’s helpful. And you haven’t been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I know of. I had a small operation on my knee, many years ago, but that is all. Just the knee. And… oh! I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a small pill for that, every day. A white pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, managed with a white pill… good. Do you happen to remember the name of that pill, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no. I just take it every morning. My daughter refills it for me. I am not good with names, you see. I mostly just try to remember to take it. Is that okay, Doctor? Will it matter if I do not know the name?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Kilton. We can look it up. It's not a problem at all. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs, if that's okay with you. And perhaps check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. If you think it will help. I trust you, Doctor. My lungs… I hope they are alright. I do worry sometimes, you see. It is the breathlessness that scares me.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's just take a listen, and we'll see. Please sit here and take a few deep breaths for me when I ask.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try. Deep breaths… like my daughter tells me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton, I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, as you described. It's more noticeable on exhale. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. And your heart rate is a bit elevated. Do you use any inhalers, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have never used an inhaler in my life. What does it… do? Is it something bad? It sounds a little scary. I just take my blood pressure pill, that is all.
DOCTOR: No, an inhaler isn't scary at all. It delivers medication directly to your lungs to help open your airways. It's quite common for people with breathing difficulties. Given your symptoms and what I'm hearing, I suspect you might have some degree of asthma, or perhaps COPD. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a chest x-ray, and a simple breathing test - a spirometry - to assess your lung function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A chest x-ray… and a test? I do not like the sound of tests, Doctor. Will it hurt? And… is it something serious? I just want to be able to breathe normally again. I miss being able to walk in the garden without getting so tired.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Kilton. The x-ray doesn't hurt at all – you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The breathing test involves blowing into a tube. It can be a little tiring, but it's very helpful in understanding what’s going on. We need these tests to figure out the best way to help you breathe easier again. I want to assure you, we’re doing this to find out what’s causing your breathlessness, not to scare you. We’ll take things one step at a time. Are you comfortable with that, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Okay… if you think it will help me breathe easier… then yes. I will try. But… my daughter will have to come with me. I do not like going to hospitals alone. And… will it take long? I have a small appointment with the hairdresser on Friday.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your daughter is very welcome to come with you. We can schedule the x-ray and spirometry for tomorrow morning, if that works. It shouldn't take more than an hour or so. We'll get the results back quickly and discuss them with you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler to help relieve your wheezing. It should give you some temporary relief. Do you have any questions about that, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: A bron… what? An inhaler… to help now? That sounds good. But… will it have side effects? I do not want to feel dizzy or anything. And… how do I use it? I have never used one before, you see.
DOCTOR: A bronchodilator, it’s a medication that helps open up your airways. Side effects are usually mild – sometimes a little shakiness or a racing heart, but those are uncommon. We’ll start with a low dose, and see how you tolerate it. And I’ll show you exactly how to use it – it’s very simple. You inhale the medication while pressing down on this canister. I’ll have the nurse demonstrate it to you as well, just to be sure. Do you feel comfortable trying it now, with me showing you?
PATIENT: Yes… if you show me. I am a little worried, but I want to be able to breathe again. And… if the nurse shows me too, that would be good. I do not want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton. Hold the inhaler like this... ... take a deep breath, and press down on the canister while breathing in slowly and deeply. Let’s try it together. Excellent! You did very well. Now, you try it on your own. I'll be right here to help. And as I said, the nurse will go over it with you again before you leave. We want you to feel completely comfortable using it. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It… feels strange. Like I am not getting enough air. But… I do feel a little bit less tight, maybe? I do not know. It is hard to explain. I think I need a glass of water. And… maybe my daughter can help me remember how to do it. I am a little forgetful, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Mrs. Kilton. It does take some getting used to. And you're right, it's a good idea to have your daughter help you remember. I'll make a note of that in your chart. I'll have the nurse bring you a glass of water right away, and go over the inhaler instructions with both of you. I’m also going to write down a detailed plan for tomorrow's tests, so you know exactly what to expect. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now. You have been very kind, Doctor. And… I am grateful you are trying to help me. It is just… scary, you see. But I will try. And… thank you for not making me feel silly about being forgetful.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. It’s perfectly alright to be scared, and there’s absolutely no need to feel silly. We’re here to help you every step of the way. I'll have the nurse come in now to go over everything with you and your daughter. Please don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you may have. Nurse, could you please come in here and review the inhaler technique and tomorrow’s test schedule with Mrs. Kilton and her daughter?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: You take care, Mrs. Kilton. And remember, we're here if you need anything. .
