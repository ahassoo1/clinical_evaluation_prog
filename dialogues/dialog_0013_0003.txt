DOCTOR: Hi Jerrel, it’s good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I told the nice lady on the phone… it’s my hand. It shakes. Been shaking for a while now. Honestly, it’s a bother. Can we just… get this over with? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re here because of a tremor in your hand, and you’d like to get things sorted out as quickly as possible. I can definitely appreciate that. “A while now” is a bit vague, though – could you tell me roughly how long we're talking?
PATIENT: Roughly? Oh, jeez… I don’t know. Months, I guess. Maybe longer. It comes and goes. It's not constant, thankfully. It's just… annoying when I’m trying to eat, or sign something. Used to be able to hold a camera steady as a rock, you know. Directed some real pictures in my day. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, months of intermittent shaking, worse with activities like eating or writing, and affecting your ability to hold things steady – particularly a camera. Got it. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger the shaking?
PATIENT: Trigger? No, not really. It just… happens. Sometimes when I'm tired, maybe? Or stressed. Though, at my age, everything stresses me out. Honestly, I doubt it's anything serious. Probably just old age catching up with me. It’s what happens when you live as long as I have.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re able to pinpoint times when it seems worse – fatigue and stress. While it could be related to age, we want to rule out other possibilities. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed the shaking anywhere else in your body besides your hand?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… maybe a little in my leg sometimes. Not often, though. Just a slight… quiver. Like when you've been sitting for too long. Probably nothing. I mostly just notice it in my hand. It's the most important part for my… well, was the most important part for my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent shaking in your hand, sometimes a slight quiver in your leg, worse with fatigue and stress. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I get tired easily, but that's just old age, like I said. And my memory isn’t what it used to be. But who remembers things these days? Look, I’m not a complicated case. Just fix the hand and let me get on with my life. Honestly, all these questions… it's a bit much.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jerrel, and I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. I just want to make sure I have all the information needed to help you. You mentioned fatigue and some memory issues – have you noticed any stiffness or pain in your hand or arm along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little ache sometimes, but nothing a little rest doesn’t fix. Stiffness… maybe a little in the mornings. Getting old, you know? Everything creaks and groans. Look, I used to have a strong grip, could hold a camera for hours. Now… not so much. Are we getting anywhere with this? I’d rather just know what the plan is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant pain, some morning stiffness, and a decrease in grip strength. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at your hand and arm, and check your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t keep me too long. I have… things to do. Though I can’t remember exactly what those things are at the moment.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, I'm noticing a tremor in your right hand, even at rest. Your muscle tone seems normal, and your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common with age. Coordination is slightly off in your right hand, as well. I'm also noting some mild dryness of the skin on your hands. Now, could you please hold this object as still as possible?
PATIENT: What is it? And how long am I supposed to hold this thing? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a busy man, or I was… Nevermind. Just hurry up. It's a little heavy, is that thing made of lead?
DOCTOR: It's a small weight, used for assessing tremor. And yes, I see the tremor is more pronounced with the weight. It appears to be a resting tremor, and also an action tremor. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it could be essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition that causes shaking. However, there are other possibilities, and we want to be sure. I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out other causes, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really? For a little shake? Look, I've lived a long life, alright? I've had all sorts of tests. I’m telling you, it's just old age. But… fine. Do your tests. Just… don’t expect any miracles. And don't keep me waiting around for the results. I haven’t got forever, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your skepticism, Jerrel. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes, and give us a clearer picture. The lab will just need a small sample. I'll also print out a requisition form for you to take to the lab. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d recommend some gentle hand exercises, and avoiding caffeine and stress as much as possible. And if the shaking worsens significantly, or you develop any other symptoms, please let me know right away. We'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… when will I get the results? And where’s the nearest lab? I don’t drive anymore, so I’ll need someone to take me. Honestly, this is a lot of trouble for a little shake. I should have just ignored it.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 3-5 business days. The nearest lab is at 123 Main Street, about a 10-minute drive from here. I can print out directions for you. I understand your frustration, Jerrel, and I want to assure you that we’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Is there anyone who can help you get to the lab?
PATIENT: My daughter. She lives nearby. She'll probably complain, but she'll do it. Look, I don’t want to sit here and talk about my personal life. Can we just… finish this? I have a feeling I’m forgetting something important, and this whole thing is making my head spin.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jerrel. I completely understand. We've covered everything for now. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. It was good meeting you. I hope you have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Right. Good. Just get it over with. And don’t expect any gratitude. I’m not one for pleasantries. .
