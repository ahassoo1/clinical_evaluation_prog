DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Doctor Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could start by telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine, I suppose. Honestly, it’s ridiculous, really. I just…can’t seem to stand on my legs properly. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a nasty cold. I haven’t felt this weak in years, and frankly, I don’t have time for this. I have tours to run.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite concerning, especially with your active lifestyle. “Can’t seem to stand properly” – can you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly, it’s quite simple. My legs…they just feel like jelly. Like they’re going to buckle under me if I try to hold myself up for too long. It’s not painful, exactly, just…weak. I have to really concentrate to walk, and even then, it’s slow and unsteady. It’s embarrassing, to be perfectly frank. And it's both legs, which makes it even more inconvenient. I mean, usually, things are just one side, right? This is…thorough.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness in both legs, starting a few days after a cold, and not associated with pain. That does sound concerning, and it's good you're bringing it to my attention. It’s important we figure out what’s going on. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit more about the cold you had?
PATIENT: Oh, it was a cold. You know, the usual. Runny nose, sore throat, a bit of a cough. Nothing major, honestly. I get them every now and then, being around so many…people. It lasted maybe five days? I just took some over-the-counter stuff, pushed through it. I really don’t have time to be laid up with every little sniffle, Doctor. I took some decongestant, a cough suppressant, and kept going. It's not like I could cancel tours because of a little cold.
DOCTOR: I understand you tried to manage it yourself, and that’s common. However, sometimes even a seemingly mild illness can have lingering effects. So, the weakness developed immediately after the cold resolved, or was there a delay?
PATIENT: No, not immediately. It was a couple of days after I started feeling better. I felt alright for maybe a day, and then…bam. Just like someone pulled the rug out from under me. It wasn't a sudden collapse or anything, it just…gradually got worse. I thought maybe I just needed some rest, but it hasn’t improved. I'm not one to complain, but this is really…limiting. It’s frustrating, frankly. I can't be out of commission.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of days after feeling better from the cold, the weakness started gradually and hasn’t improved. That's helpful. Now, besides the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think…well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't tired? I work long hours, as you can imagine, keeping tourists entertained and on schedule. No, I don't think so. No numbness, no tingling, no changes in bowel or bladder control. No fever. Just…weak legs. It’s very inconvenient. I can’t really think of anything else, to be honest. Are you looking for anything specific?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all very helpful. No fever, no numbness, no changes in bladder or bowel function – that helps narrow things down. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, I had high blood pressure for a little while, years ago. The doctor put me on something…a little pill. I take it every day, faithfully. Other than that? No. Nothing serious. I'm a healthy woman, generally. I eat reasonably well, I keep active, even with the tours. And I've never been one for…well, you know. Risky behavior. I try to take care of myself, Doctor. It’s just…this is very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication. That’s important to know. Do you recall the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…it’s a little white pill. I’ve been taking it for…years. It’s…Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril. I take one every morning with my breakfast. I haven’t missed a dose in…well, I couldn't tell you how long. I'm very diligent about my health, Doctor. It's a small price to pay to keep everything running smoothly, you know? And I make sure to get my refills on time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril is good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had a surgery. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid those. Hospitalized…hmm. Once, when I was a child, I had a bad case of…the measles, I think. But that was ages ago. Nothing since. I’ve always prided myself on my good health, Doctor. I don’t like hospitals. Too many germs, too many…people. Honestly, it’s rather unsettling. This is just…a setback. A very inconvenient setback.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, one childhood hospitalization for measles. And you’re currently taking Lisinopril for high blood pressure. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family medical conditions? Oh, let me think…my mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father…he had heart problems. He wasn't very good at taking care of himself, if I'm honest. Always smoking, eating rich foods…not like me. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had arthritis. That’s about it, I think. Nothing too serious, really. It's hardly relevant, is it? This weakness is so…specific. It's not like I have a family history of wobbly legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart problems, and arthritis. That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years—cold remedies, pain relievers—and I've never had an issue. I'm not one to be overly cautious, Doctor, but I always read the labels. Just to be sure. Honestly, I think I’m fairly robust. This weakness is so…puzzling. It's not like I’m allergic to standing. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: No, you don’t have any known allergies. Okay, Ms. Firestone, thank you for providing that information. It’s been very helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on with your legs, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Well, I suppose so. I’d rather get this sorted out quickly, to be honest. I have tours to run, as you know. I don't have all day to sit here being poked and prodded, but if it's necessary…very well. Just be quick, if you would, Doctor. And please, try not to make a mess. I've never been particularly fond of doctors' offices.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'd like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – just to get a baseline. Then, I'll examine your legs – check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take long at all. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, if you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I'll start with your legs.
PATIENT: Very well. Honestly, I don't see what lying down is going to achieve, but if you say so. Just try not to take too long, Doctor. I have a schedule to maintain. And be gentle, please. My legs are rather sensitive at the moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. Now, let's test your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It doesn’t feel very strong, does it? Honestly, it feels like I’m squeezing with cotton wool. I normally have a very firm grip. I need a strong grip for managing tourists, you know. Is something wrong? I told you my legs feel weak.
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip is noticeably weaker than expected. And you're right, the strength in your ankles and feet is also diminished. It’s symmetrical, which is…significant. Now, let's check your sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It feels…cool. Is that normal? It’s not painful, just…cool. Everything feels a bit…numb, to be honest. Not completely numb, but…distant. It’s hard to explain. It's not like a tingling sensation, it’s just…less sharp than usual. Are you getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I’m starting to feel rather anxious. This is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. Based on what you've told me, and the brief physical examination, the weakness in your legs, the diminished reflexes, reduced strength, and slightly decreased sensation—and the fact that it developed after a cold—suggests a few possibilities. It could be something called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is a rare autoimmune condition sometimes triggered by infection. It could also be a form of neuropathy, nerve damage. However, it could also be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I need to order some blood tests and possibly an electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. This will help us determine the cause of your weakness. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Guillain-what? Auto…immune? Nerve damage? Are you telling me something is seriously wrong with me? Blood tests and…electrowhat? That sounds awful. Is it contagious? Will I be paralyzed? I have tours to run, Doctor! People are relying on me! This is…this is simply unacceptable. What exactly do these tests involve? And how long will it take to get the results? And what if it is something serious? Will I ever be able to walk properly again?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Firestone, and I want to assure you that we are going to get to the bottom of this. It’s good you’re asking these questions. Let’s address your concerns one by one. Guillain-Barré syndrome is serious, but it’s rare. And many people make a full recovery with treatment. However, we don’t know yet if that’s what you have. The blood tests will help us rule out other causes and determine if further investigation is needed. The EMG involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It’s a bit uncomfortable, but it’s not usually painful. It takes about 30-60 minutes. Regarding contagion, Guillain-Barré syndrome is not contagious. As for walking, it’s too early to say whether you’ll ever be able to walk properly again. We need the test results first. However, if it is Guillain-Barré syndrome, there are treatments available that can help improve your recovery. I’m going to order the blood tests right away. We can schedule the EMG for next week. In the meantime, it’s important to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. I'll also prescribe you a short course of steroids, which may help reduce inflammation. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Steroids? I’ve heard terrible things about steroids. Do they have side effects? I don't want to gain weight. And I have a tour next week, a very important tour! What if I can't even walk by then? Is there anything else I can do? Anything at all? I can’t just rest. I have responsibilities! I have people depending on me! This is a disaster. What if it's not Guillain-Barré? What else could it be? Could it just be…a really bad pinched nerve? Or…or something that will just go away on its own? I need some reassurance, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear and anxiety, Ms. Firestone. It’s natural to worry when faced with uncertainty. Let's address your concerns one by one. Steroids do have side effects, but they are usually mild and temporary. They can cause weight gain, but that's usually manageable with diet and exercise. We'll use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. More importantly, the potential benefits of reducing inflammation outweigh the risks in this situation. As for other possibilities, yes, it could be a pinched nerve, but the widespread weakness you’re experiencing makes that less likely. It could also be a vitamin deficiency, or a metabolic disorder. That’s why the blood tests are so important – they’ll help us rule out other causes. It’s also possible that it's something that will go away on its own, but we can’t assume that. We need to be proactive and investigate. I want to reassure you that we're going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We’ll start with the blood tests and schedule the EMG. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. I’ll also write you a note for work, explaining your condition. Do you feel a little better knowing we have a plan?
PATIENT: A plan…yes, a plan is better than nothing, I suppose. But I still don't like the sound of steroids, and the EMG sounds…awful. And what if the tests take a long time? I have tours scheduled for the next month! I can’t just cancel them all. Okay, write the note for work. And schedule the EMG for as soon as possible, even if it’s inconvenient. And please, give me something for the anxiety. I can barely think straight. I need to be able to function, to make decisions, to…to run my tours. I'm a strong woman, Doctor. I can handle this. But I need your help. And I need to know what’s going on, as quickly as possible. Can you promise me that you’ll do everything you can?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Firestone. I promise you I will do everything I can. We will expedite the blood tests and schedule the EMG for the earliest available appointment – I’ll see if we can get you in early next week. And I’ll write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you manage your symptoms. Here’s the prescription for the anti-anxiety medication. It’s a low dose, and it shouldn’t interfere with your daily activities. And here’s the note for work, explaining your condition and recommending temporary restrictions. We’ll get the test results back as quickly as possible, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. You are a strong woman, Ms. Firestone. And we’ll get through this together. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s all, for now. Just…please, call me if anything comes up quickly. And thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And for…for trying. I suppose I should go home and rest, as you said. And try to relax. It’s just…hard. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. I’ll be sure to call you immediately if anything comes up. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Ms. Firestone. And try to get some rest. We'll get through this. .
