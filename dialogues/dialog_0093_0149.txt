DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this… fuss, really. My granddaughter insisted I come. Says I’m being “stubborn.” Honestly, I don’t see what the big deal is. It’s just… they want me to do things I don't need to do. And I've been a podiatrist for fifty years, young man. I think I know my own feet.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like you have a lot of experience with feet, and it's perfectly reasonable to have your own opinions about your health. It’s good you were a podiatrist for so long – that’s quite a career. And I appreciate your granddaughter looking out for you. To clarify, what specifically is bothering you – this “fuss,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Oh, it's this new doctor—the one my granddaughter found. He keeps going on about… tests. And something about “interventions.” Honestly, it sounds like a lot of poking and prodding for nothing. My feet feel a little achy sometimes, naturally! I'm eighty-three years old, you know. But I get by. I don't need anyone sticking needles in me or… or whatever it is they want to do. It's just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the ache is your primary concern, and you’re hesitant about the recommendations from the other doctor because you feel they’re excessive given your age and ability to manage. That’s very understandable. Could you describe the ache for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not a bad ache, mind you. More like… a dull throb, mostly in my left foot. It comes and goes. Worse after I’ve been standing for a while, naturally. I used to be able to stand all day, but that was… well, a long time ago. It's just… irritating. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it’s there. And this young man kept talking about circulation and… I don’t know… something about veins. Sounded awfully serious for a little bit of foot discomfort.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull throb in the left foot, worse after standing. And the other doctor mentioned circulation concerns and veins, which understandably raised your anxieties. When you say it comes and goes, roughly how often would you say it flares up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's hard to say exactly. Not every day, certainly. Maybe… three or four times a week? Some weeks it's more, some weeks it's less. It depends. If I’ve been on my feet a lot – doing errands, helping my granddaughter with the garden – it's worse, naturally. And if the weather is bad, it tends to bother me more too. Damp weather, you know. Always gets to my bones.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly three or four times a week, influenced by activity and the weather – particularly damp weather. That’s helpful to know. Now, apart from the ache, have you noticed any other changes in your feet?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Well, they’re not as… springy as they used to be, naturally. A bit more… swollen, perhaps? Especially at the end of the day. And the skin is a bit dry, I suppose. I try to moisturize, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. Oh! And my toenails are always so thick. It's a bother, really. Hard to cut them myself anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some swelling at the end of the day, dry skin despite moisturizing, thickened toenails, and difficulty with nail care. These are all things we can address. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color of your feet or toes?
PATIENT: Color, you say? Let me see… I don't think so. They look… pink enough. Maybe a little paler than they used to be, but that's just old age, I suppose. I haven't noticed any redness or anything alarming. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes my toes look a little… bluish when I'm cold. But that's just the circulation, isn’t it? I get cold easily these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that bluish discoloration with cold could be related to circulation. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any sores or blisters on your feet that are slow to heal?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not lately. I used to get a blister or two when I was younger, with ill-fitting shoes, but I'm very careful about my shoes these days. Very careful. I don't want any trouble with my feet, you understand. I need them, even if they are a bit achy. No, no sores or blisters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Gunasekara. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. My blood pressure has been a bit up and down over the years, the doctor used to say. I take a pill for it, I think. And… oh, my granddaughter says I have something with my sugar. Not the kind you put in your tea! Something with my… blood. She worries a lot, that girl. But I’m generally alright. I don’t go around complaining, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure and possibly diabetes. Do you happen to know the names of any of the medications you’re currently taking, or perhaps what they are for?
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. Let me think… there's a little white pill I take every morning. For my pressure, I think. And… there’s another one, a pink one. My granddaughter fills my pill box, you see. I just… take them. I don't bother trying to remember the names, honestly. It’s all too much fuss. She knows what I need, and she makes sure I get it. It's much easier that way.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Gunasekara. We can look that up. Let me just access your medical record here... Ah, yes. It appears you are taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure and Metformin for diabetes. Are you currently experiencing any side effects from either of those medications?
PATIENT: Met… what-in? Oh, my. All those fancy names! No, I don't think so. I haven't noticed anything… different. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but that's just old age, I suppose. And sometimes my stomach feels a little funny, but I eat anything, really. No, no side effects that I've noticed. Honestly, I'm just glad they keep me ticking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – your parents, siblings, or children – had problems with diabetes, heart disease, or circulation issues?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother... she had a bad heart, I think. She was always complaining about it. And she had… swelling in her legs, towards the end. Spent a lot of time in bed, poor woman. My father… he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. And I had a brother… he passed away young, from something with his lungs, I think. Not feet, certainly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Gunasekara. That's helpful information. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh, my. Well, I mostly sit and read. I like my books. And I like to watch my stories on the television. My granddaughter makes me go for little walks sometimes, but I don't have much energy for that. I used to be very active, but… those days are long gone. I’m a simple woman, young man. Simple pleasures.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Now, Ms. Gunasekara, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your feet and legs. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well… I suppose so. But don’t poke too much, alright? And don't expect me to jump up and down. I'm not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Ms. Gunasekara. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check the pulses in your feet. Alright, the pulses are a little diminished, but present in both feet. Now, I’m going to check the sensation in your feet. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: It… tickles, mostly. A little strange, mind you. I can feel it, but it’s not as strong as it used to be. My feet feel… numb sometimes, especially when it’s cold. But I can feel that brush, yes. It’s just… faint. Don't go poking about too much, alright? You're making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. I’m just checking your sensation. Now, I’m going to take a look at your skin. I notice some dryness and thickening of the skin, as you mentioned, and your toenails are quite thick. I don't see any open sores or signs of infection at this time, which is good. Now, I will check your reflexes. Your reflexes are diminished, but present. Finally, I will check the temperature in your feet. There's a slight temperature difference between your left and right foot, but it’s not significant. Overall, your exam suggests some mild peripheral neuropathy – that’s nerve damage – and reduced circulation in both feet. The decreased sensation and temperature difference are concerning. It's consistent with diabetes and reduced blood flow. It doesn’t sound alarming, but we need to address it.
PATIENT: Neu-ro-po-what-y? Oh dear. And reduced… circulation? That sounds… serious. I knew I shouldn't have come. This is all just fuss. My granddaughter will be thrilled. She always says I need to be poked and prodded and tested. This is just what she wants. I told you I didn't need any interventions!
DOCTOR: Please don't worry, Ms. Gunasekara. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does mean we need to take some precautions to prevent any further complications. "Neuropathy" just means there's some nerve damage, often related to diabetes. And reduced circulation means the blood flow to your feet isn't as strong as it should be. It's common in people with diabetes, and we can manage it with careful foot care and medication. It’s not about poking and prodding, it's about keeping your feet healthy so you can continue to enjoy your simple pleasures. We aren't necessarily talking about “interventions” at this stage. I’d like to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function. I’d also like to do a simple test called an Ankle-Brachial Index to assess the circulation in your legs more precisely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… more tests… I suppose so. If it will get my granddaughter off my back. But I don't want any needles! And no prodding. Just… quick, alright? And tell me what everything means this time. Not all that fancy doctor talk. Just… simple. Can you promise me simple? And no interventions.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Gunasekara. I will keep everything as simple as possible, and I will explain everything clearly. And no interventions unless absolutely necessary. We’ll start with the blood work and the Ankle-Brachial Index. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your blood sugar levels and kidney function. The Ankle-Brachial Index is a quick, painless test that measures the blood flow in your legs. It involves taking blood pressure readings in your ankles and arms. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan to manage your blood sugar levels, improve your circulation, and protect your feet. This might involve medication, regular foot care, and lifestyle changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… That means I have to walk more. Alright. Fine. Let’s get it over with. But don't expect me to be grateful. My granddaughter will be thrilled, you know. She’s always right, apparently. Just… try not to keep me here all day, alright? I have my stories to watch.
DOCTOR: I will do my best, Ms. Gunasekara. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. The Ankle-Brachial Index will only take a few minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to write down some information about foot care for you to review. It’s very important to keep your feet clean and dry, and to inspect them daily for any cuts, blisters, or sores. I'll also give you a referral to a podiatrist for regular checkups. To be cautious, given the reduced sensation and circulation, I'm also going to recommend a consultation with a vascular specialist. They can perform a more detailed evaluation of your blood flow and recommend any necessary treatment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A vascular specialist? You're not messing with me, are you? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. First the blood work, then a podiatrist, now a… a vascular specialist? My granddaughter is going to be insufferable. Alright. Fine. But tell them to be quick. I don’t have all day. And no prodding! Do you promise me no prodding?
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. Gunasekara. The vascular specialist will perform a thorough evaluation, but it shouldn’t involve any painful procedures at this stage. It’s just a precaution to make sure everything is alright. They might use ultrasound to look at the blood flow in your legs, which is completely painless. Let me give you the referral information. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we can schedule an appointment with the vascular specialist. In the meantime, please remember to take it easy and avoid any strenuous activity. And remember, the most important thing is to keep your feet healthy and protected. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Just… why can’t I just leave it alone? Why does everything have to be poked and prodded and tested? Honestly, I think my granddaughter is trying to get rid of me. No. No more questions. Just get it over with. And don't expect me to be grateful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Gunasekara. I won’t push you to ask any further questions. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready for the blood draw. Just remember, this is about taking care of your health, and making sure you can continue to enjoy your life. The nurse will be in shortly. If you have any concerns after the blood draw, please don’t hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know. And if you think of any questions later, please feel free to call the clinic. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Gunasekara. And I hope you have a pleasant afternoon.
PATIENT: Hmph. A pleasant afternoon... As if. .
