DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my heart, it does funny things sometimes. Like, it beats too fast, but not always. It feels… fluttery. That is why I am here.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fluttery” is a good way to describe it. And it happens sometimes, not all the time?
PATIENT: Yes. Not all the time. Maybe… two, three times a week? Sometimes more if I… work very hard. Long hours. It does not hurt, just… strange. Uncomfortable. Like a bird in my chest.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a couple of times a week, more when you’re working long hours. No pain, just a fluttering sensation. And you’d say it feels like something in your chest, not radiating anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! In the chest. Not go anywhere else. No pain. Just… feel it. Like, I can feel my heart beating fast, but not… normal fast. A different fast. And… it stops after a little while. Maybe five minutes, maybe ten. Then it goes back to normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And has anything specific triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? I don't know what that means. Like… something makes it happen? Sometimes after coffee. But not always. And sometimes… when I am worried. About work, or… family. But it does not happen every time I worry. It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coffee can be a trigger, and sometimes worry. Not consistently, though. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… other things? Sometimes I feel… a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And maybe… a little short of breath. But that could be from the fast heart, yes? I am not sure. It all happens at the same time, so hard to know what is what.
DOCTOR: Right, it can be hard to separate things out when they happen together. Okay, so dizziness and a little shortness of breath along with the fluttering. Now, have you ever had this checked out before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is the first time. I… I always thought it would go away. It always has before. But it is happening more now, so I thought maybe I should see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. And do you have any medical problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No. Nothing that I know of. I… I work hard. I try to eat good food. I have not been sick in a long time. My wife, she says I worry too much, but… that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that is all. Just a cast. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father, he had… problems with his blood pressure, I think. High blood pressure. And my mother… she had some problems with her stomach. But… nothing like this. No heart problems that I know of. They both passed away a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of high blood pressure with your father, stomach issues with your mother, but no heart problems that you’re aware of. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. No. I can eat anything. I can take any medicine, I think. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I do not like to take medicine if I can help it. I try to rest when I am not feeling good. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your pulse and blood pressure. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. Your heart sounds… a little fast, even at rest. I'm hearing a rate of 98 beats per minute. Blood pressure is 130/85. Pulse is regular. Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. I'm also going to feel your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or tenderness. Everything else looks okay on a quick exam.
PATIENT: Okay. That… 98 is fast? I feel it sometimes, I think. What does that mean? Is it bad? And what about the… fluttery thing? Is that what is making my heart fast?
DOCTOR: 98 is a little on the higher side for resting, yes. Normal is usually between 60 and 100, but it can vary. The “fluttery” sensation you’re describing, along with the occasional fast heart rate, could be a few things. It sounds like you might be experiencing what we call palpitations – that's just a general term for feeling your heart beat irregularly or strongly. Often, palpitations aren't serious. They can be caused by things like stress, caffeine, dehydration, or even just exertion. But, since it's happening more frequently, and you’re feeling lightheaded, we want to rule out anything more serious. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I… I do not like tests. Will they hurt? Is it something very bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I'll explain everything. The tests are simple and generally don't hurt. We'll start with an EKG – that's an electrocardiogram. It records the electrical activity of your heart. It's quick, painless, and involves placing some stickers on your chest. Then, I'd like to do a blood test to check your thyroid levels and rule out any electrolyte imbalances. That will just involve a small sample of blood from your arm. Finally, I'd like to consider a Holter monitor. It's a small device you wear for 24-48 hours that continuously records your heart rhythm. It will help us see if the palpitations are happening when you're not in the clinic. These tests will give us a better picture of what's going on and help us determine the best course of action. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is very bad, it's just a precaution. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and blood… and wear something for two days. That sounds… a lot. But… if it will help, I guess. My wife, she will be happy I am getting it checked. Will I know when I can go home after the stickers? And… how much will all of this cost? I do not have insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The stickers, the EKG, takes about five minutes and you can go home right after. As for the blood test, it'll also be quick – maybe ten minutes in the lab. And then we’ll get you set up with the Holter monitor before you leave. I understand your concern about the cost, especially without insurance. Let me check the pricing for you and see what the out-of-pocket costs will be. I can also see if there are any programs available to help with the cost of tests for uninsured patients. The EKG will be around $75, the blood test around $50, and the Holter monitor around $150 for the rental and analysis. I’ll also ask the billing department about potential discounts or payment plans for uninsured patients. Does that give you a rough idea?
PATIENT: $75, $50, $150… That is a lot of money. Maybe… maybe just the stickers and blood test? I do not know if I can afford the… Holter. And will I need to take medicine if it is something bad? I do not want to take medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can definitely start with just the EKG and blood test. That will give us a good initial understanding of what’s going on. We can always add the Holter monitor later if needed. And regarding medication, it depends on what we find. Many palpitations are harmless and don't require any treatment. If we do find something that needs to be addressed, there are often lifestyle changes we can try first, like reducing caffeine intake or managing stress. If medication is necessary, we’ll discuss all your options and make sure you’re comfortable with the plan. Let’s get started with the EKG and blood test. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. The stickers and blood. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. Just let me know if you have any questions at any point. And remember, we're just gathering information right now. We'll figure out what's going on and make a plan together.
