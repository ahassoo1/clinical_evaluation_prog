DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. The...paper said patient education? My husband make appointment. I don't really know why I'm here. Something about… learning? I work with metal, you know. Not school.
DOCTOR: Right. Patient education. Yes. Well, it appears your husband was concerned about something… perhaps related to your work?
PATIENT: Work is...work. Hard. Loud. Metal is heavy. I wear gloves, always. What is there to learn about that? He worry too much, my husband. Always has. Is everything okay? You check me for something wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Fontanazza, sometimes working with metals can… have certain effects. Let’s just go through a few things to be thorough. Have you experienced any unusual symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not sick. Tired, yes. Very tired. But metal work is tiring! And… sometimes my hands feel… numb. But I wear gloves! Thick ones. Is that a symptom? What kind of symptoms you mean?
DOCTOR: Numbness… okay. And how long have you been experiencing this numbness?
PATIENT: Um… a long time, I think? Maybe… a year? Hard to say. It comes and goes. When I’m working a lot, it’s worse. When I rest… a little better. It’s not… terrible. Just annoying. Like my fingers are sleeping. You think it’s something bad?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Fontanazza, prolonged numbness could indicate several things. Given your occupation, we need to consider potential nerve compression or… other occupational hazards. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: Exam? Like… check my hands? Okay. But don’t take too long, I have things to do. And be gentle! I need these hands for work. Are you gonna poke me with something?
DOCTOR: No poking, Ms. Fontanazza. Just assessing your range of motion and sensation. Now, can you squeeze my fingers?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. Everything feels a little…slow today. Maybe I’m just tired. Do I pass? Are my hands okay? You find something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is… diminished, yes. And there's some decreased sensation in your fingertips. It appears we may be dealing with some early signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, or potentially something related to repetitive strain injury. It’s not immediately alarming, but it requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Carpal...what? Like a tunnel for cars? I work with metal, not cars! And...strain? I'm strong! I lift heavy things all day. This doesn't sound right. What does "investigation" even mean? Are you gonna send me home? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Carpal tunnel syndrome affects the nerves in your wrist, causing numbness and weakness. It’s common in occupations involving repetitive hand movements, like… metal work. "Investigation" means we need to run some tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the problem. We’ll need to do some nerve conduction studies… and possibly some blood work to rule out other underlying conditions. I'm going to order those tests now.
PATIENT: Tests? Like… needles? I don't like needles. And blood work? Why blood? Metal work doesn't make my blood bad! My husband… he always sends me to doctors for everything. It's probably nothing. Just… tired hands. Can't I just rest? Is there medicine for tired hands? Something quick? I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, while rest is important, ignoring these symptoms could lead to more significant problems down the line. The nerve conduction study involves small electrodes placed on your skin – it's not particularly painful, but it does take some time. And the blood work is just to rule out any other potential causes. I understand you need to get back to work, but we need to be thorough. I’m going to order these tests for you, and then we can discuss a plan. I will also give you a referral to a hand specialist for a second opinion, given your concerns.
