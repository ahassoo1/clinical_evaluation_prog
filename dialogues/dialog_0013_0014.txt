DOCTOR: Hi Ronnald, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello there, Chriselda. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… let me think. My wife, she handles most of these things, you see. Something about paperwork… for… time off? Or maybe something with the insurance? It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. I believe it has to do with my job… at the… church. Yes, that's it! Religious activities, that's what I do. I need some forms filled out, I think. For… FMLA or disability… or something like that. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Ronnald. It sounds like you might need some documentation related to either Family and Medical Leave or possibly a short-term disability claim through your work at the church. We can definitely get that sorted out for you. Just to be clear, is this related to a new medical issue, or is it a continuation of something we’ve discussed before?
PATIENT: Oh dear, a new issue, I think. I… don’t recall seeing you before, so it must be new. It’s… my back, mostly. Been acting up lately. It's hard to explain… just a general ache, you know? Gets worse if I stand for too long, which, with my job… well, that happens a lot. It's not… a sudden injury or anything. Just… old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a new back ache that's worsened with standing. I understand. And you said it hasn't come on suddenly, more of a gradual onset?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual, that's the word. It didn't just happen one day. It’s been… building, I suppose. A little bit worse each week. I tried ignoring it, you know? Thought it would just go away on its own. But it hasn’t. My wife said I really should get it checked out… and get this paperwork sorted, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s… lower back, mostly. Right around here. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not too bad. It's more of a dull ache than a sharp pain, usually. It’s hard to describe, really. It just… is there. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, potentially radiating down the leg, described as a dull ache. Does anything specifically make it better or worse, besides standing?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… Sitting helps, actually. Especially if I can lean back a bit. And lying down, definitely. Warm baths are nice too. That takes the edge off for a while. But… lifting anything is bad. Even something small. And bending over… forget about it! That's just asking for trouble. It’s getting to the point where my wife has to do most of the gardening now. She doesn’t complain, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sitting, leaning back, warm baths help, and lifting and bending worsen it. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no weakness either. I can walk just fine. It just… aches. A lot. Everything feels a little stiff in the mornings, but that goes away after I get moving. Honestly, I'm probably just getting old. It's probably nothing serious. But my wife… well, she worries. And this paperwork… she wants me to get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. No numbness, tingling, or weakness, just stiffness in the mornings that improves with movement. It sounds like it's primarily lower back pain that's aggravated by activity. To help me complete the necessary paperwork, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking the hard questions. My past medical history… hmm. Let me see. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I used to have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, years ago. But that was sorted out with some medication. And… I think I had the flu once? Nothing major, really. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to eat well, and I stay active when I can. Honestly, I can’t really remember much else. My wife keeps track of all that. Perhaps she’d know better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some history of high blood pressure that was treated, and occasional flu. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any of those. And no hospitalizations either. Not that I recall, anyway. I've been very lucky, I think. Just a few minor illnesses over the years, nothing serious enough to require a hospital stay. I pride myself on being a strong, healthy man. It's just this back… It's a bit embarrassing, really. A strong man shouldn't have a bad back.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother, she had arthritis in her hands, I think. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life. Nothing too specific, I don't think. They both lived to a good age, though. My mother was 87, and my father… maybe 90? Something like that. It's all a bit fuzzy now. It was a long time ago. I don't think there was anything major, nothing that I'm aware of. We weren’t really the type to talk about medical things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your father. Now, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, right, medications. Just a small pill for my blood pressure, still. Been taking it for years. Nothing else. And allergies… let me see. No, I don’t think so. I've never had any problems with allergies. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any reactions to medications. At least, not that I remember. My wife always double-checks these things, you know. She has a better memory than I do. I'm not very good with details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're currently taking medication for blood pressure and have no known allergies. Alright, Ronnald, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m not one for fussing, you know. Just tell me what you need me to do. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could lie down on your back for me, please. I’m going to start by just feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. I'll also have you do a few simple movements to see how your back responds. Don’t hesitate to tell me if anything causes pain. Okay, Ronnald, I’ve palpated your lower back and checked your range of motion. I found some tenderness to the left of your spine at the L4-L5 level. Your range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with bending forward and to the left. There’s no evidence of radiculopathy – meaning the pain isn’t clearly traveling down your leg in a pattern consistent with a pinched nerve. Strength and reflexes in your lower extremities appear normal. No other abnormalities noted.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That didn’t sound too bad. L4-L5… is that serious? Limited range of motion… that explains why bending over is so difficult. Radiculopathy… that’s a big word. So, nothing pinched? That’s good to hear, I suppose. So what does all that mean, doctor? Is it just old age, like I thought? And what about this paperwork? Will I be able to get it filled out?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ronnald. The tenderness at L4-L5 and limited range of motion suggest some muscle strain or mild degenerative changes in that area of your spine. It's not uncommon with age and activity. The fact that there’s no radiculopathy is a good sign, meaning the pain isn’t currently affecting the nerves in your legs. While it’s difficult to say definitively without imaging, based on the exam, it doesn’t appear to be a serious, acute problem like a fracture or severe nerve compression. However, it is causing you pain and limiting your function, and that needs to be addressed. As for the paperwork, I can definitely complete the forms for FMLA or short-term disability. I’ll document my findings, including the tenderness and limited range of motion, and recommend physical therapy to help improve your strength, flexibility, and pain management. I’ll also include a note outlining that imaging is not currently indicated, but may be considered if your symptoms worsen or do not improve with conservative treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Physical therapy… that’s good. I can try that. I’ve always been a bit stubborn about asking for help, but I suppose I need to take care of myself. Not indicated… so no need for those scary machines right now? Good. So, you'll fill out the paperwork, and I'll go see someone about physical therapy? Will you have a list of places, or should my wife look that up? And… will this be covered by insurance?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. I'll complete the necessary paperwork for you. As for physical therapy, I can provide you with a list of reputable clinics in the area that are in-network with your insurance. I’ll print that out for you before you leave. Coverage will depend on your specific insurance plan, but most plans do cover physical therapy with a doctor’s referral. I recommend checking with your insurance provider to confirm your benefits and any potential co-pays or deductibles. I can also have my office staff verify your coverage for you if you’d like. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate your pain, using over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and applying heat or ice to your lower back. We'll re-evaluate your progress in a few weeks to see if physical therapy is providing relief. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. A list of places would be wonderful. And having the office staff check the insurance… that would be a huge help. My wife is good with that sort of thing, but I don’t want to bother her unless I have to. Avoid activities… that’s hard. Gardening is my favorite. But I’ll try. And heat… yes, a warm bath always feels good. Thank you, doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I think that’s everything for now, isn’t it? Just the paperwork and the list of places? .
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for now. I'll print out the paperwork and the list of physical therapy clinics, and my staff will verify your insurance coverage. Here you go. Please let us know if you have any questions. And don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if your symptoms worsen or don't improve with treatment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ronnald. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon.
