DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up… something about getting checked out before the surgery happens. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It’s a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you're here for a pre-operative evaluation related to weight loss surgery. That’s good. It's standard to get a full check-up beforehand. You said it’s a bit of a blur...do you recall who scheduled the appointment, or perhaps the name of the surgeon?
PATIENT: Hmm… my wife, definitely. Her name is Layla. I think the surgeon’s name starts with a ‘B’… but I couldn’t swear to it. We went to a lot of appointments last year, everything’s kind of running together. Sorry about that. It’s not that I don’t want to remember, it just… doesn’t stick.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common to have a lot on your mind. We’ll figure it out. Let's focus on you for now. Can you tell me a little bit more about why you’re considering weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve always been bigger, I guess. But it’s gotten harder, you know? Just… everything. Walking, getting up from chairs… even playing with my kids. It’s not fun being out of breath all the time. Layla worries about my health, and… I want to be around for them. That’s the big thing. I want to be able to do things with them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it's impacting your daily life and you're motivated to improve your quality of life and be more active with your children. That's a great reason. Before we proceed, let's go over some medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. I think the doctor told me my blood sugar was a little high at one point, but I don’t take anything for it. And I get… winded easily, like I said. Does that count? I don’t really go to the doctor much unless I absolutely have to. I don’t have any… big problems, I guess. No heart trouble or anything like that. Layla keeps track of all that stuff, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, potentially elevated blood sugar, and you experience shortness of breath with exertion. We'll need to investigate that further. Have you ever been diagnosed with sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Sleep… apnea? I don’t think so. Layla says I snore… a lot. And she sometimes nudges me to wake me up because she says I stop breathing for a second. But I don’t know if that’s… what that thing is. Is that a bad thing? Sorry, I don’t mean to be difficult. I just… don’t know a lot of these medical words.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being difficult at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly normal not to be familiar with medical terminology. Snoring and pauses in breathing during sleep can be indicative of sleep apnea, and it's something we definitely need to address, especially before surgery. Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think. Just the one. And… Layla said I had my tonsils out, but I don’t really remember that either. It was a long time ago. Nothing major recently, though. No operations in the last… ten years, at least. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child and tonsillectomy in the past. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Family history… that's a tough one. My dad… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young. And my mom, she's got diabetes. She takes pills for it. And… a lot of my family on my mom’s side… they’re bigger people. Like me, I guess. It seems to run in the family, yeah. A lot of weight issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart disease and diabetes on your father’s side, and obesity and diabetes on your mother’s side. That’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can take most pills without any problems. Layla always double-checks, but she hasn’t found anything either. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Layla keeps telling me I should take something for my aches and pains, but I just… deal with it. I don't like feeling all stuffy from medicine. Just nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. Before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly review your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I don’t really like the smell of it. I’ll have a beer with Layla sometimes, but not often. And definitely no drugs. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doctor. Just work and family, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no drug use. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Your heart sounds a little… rapid, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but you do seem a little short of breath even at rest. Your abdomen is soft, but there's some fullness. I’m also noting a Body Mass Index of 36.2, which falls into the obese category. Do you have any pain when I press here on your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't hurt to press... just feels… full, like I ate a big meal. It's usually like that, to be honest. A bit uncomfortable, but not painful. I get that feeling a lot, especially after dinner. Is that bad? I’m probably just carrying a little extra weight, right?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad”, but it’s something we need to investigate further, especially with your family history and the shortness of breath you’re experiencing. I'm going to order some blood work. It will check your blood sugar, cholesterol, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. I’d also like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung conditions and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate that, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and X-rays, okay. Will Layla need to be there for any of that? I usually get a little nervous at hospitals, and she’s good at keeping me calm. And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m hoping we can get this surgery scheduled soon. I really want to start feeling better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Layla doesn’t need to be present for the blood work or X-ray, but she’s welcome to join you if she’d like. The lab work typically takes 24-48 hours to come back, and the X-ray results should be available within the same timeframe. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're in. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a referral to a registered dietitian. They can help you with a healthy eating plan to prepare for the surgery. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… really good, actually. A dietitian would be helpful. I always struggle with knowing what to eat. Layla tries to help, but… it’s just confusing. So, blood work, X-rays, and a dietitian. And then we’ll talk again next week? That’s great, Doctor. Thank you. I feel a little better just knowing we’re getting things sorted out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad I could ease some of your concerns. I'll have the lab order and X-ray requisition ready for you, and the referral to the dietitian. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve covered a lot. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you for not making me feel stupid when I couldn’t remember things. It’s… nice to have a doctor who understands.
