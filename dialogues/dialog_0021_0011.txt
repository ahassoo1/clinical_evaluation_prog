DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Doctor… Havird, is it? Look, I ain’t got all day. I need a… a paper. A clearance, you understand? For somethin’… cosmetic. A little fixin’ up. Is that what you do here? Don’t need to hear a life story, just need the okay to go ahead with it.
DOCTOR: Right. A clearance. For… cosmetic work. Well, we can do that, but even for something cosmetic, I need to understand what exactly you’re planning. It’s a basic responsibility, you see. Just to make sure there aren’t any underlying issues that might… complicate things. What kind of procedure are you looking at?
PATIENT: Complicate things? Doctor, it’s not brain surgery. It’s… somethin’ for my face. That’s all. Look, a friend recommended this place, said you just sign the paper. I don't recall exactly what it is… somethin’ with the… skin. Tightenin’ it up, maybe? I don't have all the details, honestly. It was a good deal. Is that somethin’ you can approve or not? Don't need to know specifics.
DOCTOR: A “good deal”… Right. Well, I really need to know what procedure you're intending to have before I can even think about signing off on anything. "Tightening up" is… vague, to say the least. It could be anything from a simple cream to… well, something more invasive. And frankly, signing off on something without knowing what it is would be irresponsible. Do you have any paperwork from the… provider you're seeing?
PATIENT: Paperwork? Now see here… I told you, I ain’t got time for all this. A friend did it, said it was simple. Some kinda… clinic, not a real doctor, I guess. A deal, that's all. Look, I just want the paper. You askin’ a lot of questions. It's… uh… a face lift, I think? Or somethin’ close to it. I really don't know! Is that good enough? Just say yes or no, Doctor. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: A “clinic, not a real doctor”… Mr. Honcoop, that’s… concerning. Look, I am not going to sign off on a procedure performed by someone who isn’t a licensed medical professional. That’s just… not happening. And even with a licensed professional, I need to know specifics. What kind of facelift?
PATIENT: Good grief! Look, I told you, I don't know! It was a deal! They said it would fix things up, make me look younger. I don't recall the name of the place or the fancy words they used. I just know it was… affordable. You're makin’ this very difficult, Doctor. I need this done. Can't you just… look at my face and tell me if I’m okay to go ahead? I ain't got the patience for all this detail! What kinda doctor are you, anyway?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, that’s… not how medicine works. I cannot ethically—or legally—approve a surgical procedure without knowing what it is. It's about patient safety. And frankly, your insistence on not knowing details, and seeing someone who isn't a licensed professional... it’s raising red flags. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any underlying conditions?
PATIENT: Underlying conditions? What for? It's a face lift, not a heart transplant! I’m a reasonably healthy man for my age. I work, I… I get around. Never been seriously sick, nothin' major. A little arthritis in the knees, maybe. That’s it! Look, I don't have time for a full checkup. Just tell me if I can get this done or not! This is ridiculous. Are you trying to avoid doin’ the paper or somethin’? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but I am not going to sign off on a procedure performed by an unknown, unlicensed provider, and without a proper medical evaluation. It's not about avoiding paperwork, it’s about your well-being. I’m concerned about your safety, and I cannot compromise my ethical obligations. I strongly recommend you find a board-certified plastic surgeon, and have a thorough consultation and medical evaluation before proceeding. I can provide you with some referrals if you'd like. Otherwise, I'm afraid I can't assist you. .
