DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve been… experimenting with diets, shall we say. Rather extreme ones, lately. I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I did any further damage, or… well, before I simply run out of steam. It all started with a rather insistent grandson, you see. He's convinced I need to be on the latest thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're being proactive about this, Mr. Vantine. Grandchildren can be very persuasive! And it's always wise to check in with a doctor when making significant changes to your diet. So, can you tell me a little more about these “extreme diets”?
PATIENT: Certainly. The first one... let me see... Ah, yes. It was the "Breatharian Diet." The idea being you get all your sustenance from sunlight and… well, air, essentially. I lasted precisely three days. Mostly because I felt remarkably faint and my housekeeper began to worry. Before that, there was the Carnivore Diet – purely meat, you understand. That one was… less unpleasant, but rather monotonous and, I suspect, not terribly good for one's constitution. And currently… I am attempting a rather severe juice cleanse. Though I confess, I snuck a biscuit with my tea this morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's quite a range of diets. The Breatharian diet is… well, not a medically supported approach, to put it mildly. And while the Carnivore diet can provide some short-term benefits for some people, it's also not sustainable long-term. A juice cleanse… those can be tricky too, especially at your age. Now, Mr. Vantine, can you describe any specific symptoms you've been experiencing while on these diets?
PATIENT: Symptoms, you say? Oh, where to begin… With the Breatharian one, a constant lightheadedness, naturally. A dreadful headache. And a distinct lack of energy, to put it mildly. The Carnivore one… well, let’s just say my digestive system wasn’t particularly pleased. A certain… sluggishness, if you understand. And with this current juice cleanse… I feel rather weak, and, if I'm honest, perpetually hungry. A bit irritable, too. My housekeeper has certainly noticed that. Though I suspect she’s accustomed to my eccentricities.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, digestive issues, weakness, irritability… those all sound like potential consequences of these restrictive diets. And it's good your housekeeper is looking out for you. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Goodness, that’s a bit of a litany, isn’t it? Let me see… No diabetes, thankfully. My blood pressure was a little elevated a few years ago, but it’s been quite stable with a little… moderation. I had a rather unpleasant bout of atrial fibrillation a decade ago, but the cardiologist assures me it’s well-managed with medication. Otherwise… just the usual aches and pains of an old man, I suppose. Though my grandson insists those are due to a lack of “superfoods”.
DOCTOR: Okay, so controlled hypertension, history of atrial fibrillation, currently managed with medication… that’s helpful. And it’s good it’s well-controlled. Do you recall what medication you're taking for the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see... it's Apixaban, I believe. Yes, Apixaban, 5 milligrams, twice daily. And a small dose of Bisoprolol, as well, for the blood pressure. Though, as I said, the doctor assures me it's a minimal dose. I've been on both for… oh, seven years now, perhaps? Eight? Time does rather slip one’s mind these days.
DOCTOR: Apixaban 5mg twice daily, and Bisoprolol… excellent. That matches what I see here. Now, Mr. Vantine, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I pride myself on being remarkably… robust in that regard. No allergies to speak of. Though I've always disliked Brussels sprouts, but I hardly consider that an allergy. My mother insisted on them, naturally. A common affliction, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. And I completely understand the dislike of certain foods – Brussels sprouts are a common aversion! Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Hmm. Rather a solitary existence these days, if I'm honest. Divorced… oh, goodness, almost forty years ago now. No children, sadly. I dedicate most of my time to my work, really. Special effects and animation, you see. A rather demanding profession, even at my age. And… visiting with my grandson, of course. He’s quite insistent on keeping me active, which, though occasionally… overzealous, is rather kind of him. I enjoy reading, a bit of gardening when the weather permits, and the occasional trip to the cinema. That’s about the extent of it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so divorced, no children, working in special effects and animation… that’s good to know. And it's wonderful that you have a close relationship with your grandson. Now, Mr. Vantine, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how you’re doing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Perfectly alright. I suppose one doesn’t get examined very often these days, so it’s probably a good thing. Though I warn you, my joints aren’t what they used to be. Do let me know if anything feels particularly… alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from the recent diets and your activity level. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, but a little… sluggish, as you mentioned. Pulses are a little weak, but present. Blood pressure is 140/85 – a little elevated. No edema in your feet. Everything seems reasonably stable, Mr. Vantine, but we definitely need to address these diets and get you back on a more balanced eating plan. I'm concerned about the potential for nutrient deficiencies and dehydration, especially with your history of atrial fibrillation.
PATIENT: I suspected as much, Doctor. My housekeeper was muttering about dehydration, actually. She's a very observant woman. Dehydration and… well, general foolishness, she implied. I confess, I’m rather relieved to hear a professional confirm my own suspicions. What sort of eating plan do you recommend, then? Something… less adventurous, perhaps? And something that won’t alarm my grandson, if that's possible. He’s quite… enthusiastic about these things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Vantine. We’ll aim for something sensible and sustainable. A restrictive diet like the ones you’ve been trying is not a long-term solution, and can actually be harmful. I recommend focusing on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. We want to ensure you’re getting all the nutrients you need, especially with your existing health conditions. It's important to stay hydrated, as your housekeeper rightly pointed out. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. We can also consider a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you create a personalized meal plan. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A registered dietitian, you say? Yes, that sounds… sensible. A professional opinion would certainly be helpful. And it might placate my grandson, if I tell him I'm following expert advice. Eight glasses of water… I suppose I can manage that. Though I do enjoy a cup of tea with my biscuit… perhaps we can negotiate on that front? Is there anything I should be avoiding completely, other than the latest "superfood" fad?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A registered dietitian is an excellent idea. I’ll write up a referral for you right away. And a cup of tea and a biscuit is perfectly reasonable! We're not aiming for deprivation, just moderation. As for things to avoid, I’d recommend limiting processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of salt and saturated fats. Given your atrial fibrillation, it's also wise to be mindful of your potassium intake—too much or too little can affect your heart rhythm. I recommend avoiding grapefruit, as it can interact with some medications. I’m also going to order some blood work to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and overall health. We’ll need to see where you're at currently before we make any major changes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work, of course. Perfectly comfortable. One has to be pragmatic, after all. And limiting processed foods… I suppose I can manage that as well. Though my housekeeper does have a fondness for rather rich pastries… Perhaps I can convince her to moderate as well. And the grapefruit… noted. It’s all rather sensible, Doctor. Sensible is good. Thank you for your patience, and for not entirely dismissing my foolish experiments. Now, about that referral… when might I expect to hear from the dietitian?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. And I'm glad we're focusing on a sensible approach. I've just sent the referral to a registered dietitian in the area. They should be contacting you within the next few business days to schedule an appointment. I’ll also have the lab order sent to the lab near you. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I do. You’ve been most thorough, and remarkably patient with an old fool and his dietary whims. I appreciate your guidance, and I look forward to hearing from the dietitian. Thank you again for your time. I suspect my housekeeper will be relieved. And perhaps, just perhaps, a little less muttering. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with the dietitian. Take care, and enjoy your tea—with a biscuit, of course.
