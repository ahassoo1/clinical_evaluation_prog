DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. It is… very nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? Yes. It is… the words. They… they do not come so easy now. It is difficult, you understand? I… I forget them. Not everything, but… important things sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with your memory, specifically with word recall. That can be concerning, and we want to figure out what’s going on. When did you first start noticing this difficulty with your words?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did I… notice? That is… a difficult question. It was… some time ago, I think. Not suddenly, no. More… slowly. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It is hard to say exactly. My wife… she would have known. She always remembered everything. But… she is gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's difficult to pinpoint things when there’s been a lot going on, and losing your wife must have been incredibly hard. Six months or longer… okay. And has this difficulty with words been getting progressively worse over that time, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: Progressively… yes, I believe that is the word. Slowly, but… yes. It is… more often now. Before, maybe just… names. Or… a word when speaking to someone. Now… now it is… more. Sometimes I… I know what I mean to say, but the word… it is just… gone. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I can definitely understand how frustrating that must be. It’s good that you’re recognizing the changes and bringing them to my attention. Aside from the difficulty with finding words, have you noticed any other changes in your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… sometimes I feel… a little lost. Not lost lost, but… confused. Like I am… searching for something, even when I do not know what I am searching for. And… I forget things more easily. Where I put my glasses, for example. Or… what I had for breakfast. Small things, mostly. But… more often now than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased forgetfulness and a feeling of being slightly confused at times. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality?
PATIENT: Mood…? Oh. Well. My wife… she always kept things… brighter. I… I miss her very much. I am… sad, of course. But I try to… to be strong. I do not… I do not laugh as much, perhaps. And… I sometimes feel… anxious. Especially when I… when I cannot find the words. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly have a significant impact on mood, and anxiety is a very common response to changes like this. We’ll definitely consider all of that as we try to figure out what’s going on. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me think. I… I had high blood pressure, for many years. The doctor put me on pills. I still take them, every day. And… I had a small operation on my knee, many years ago. A sports injury, when I was young. Otherwise… I was always… healthy, I think. I do not remember any other… problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication and a previous knee surgery. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… the name. Yes. That is… difficult. I have… many pills. The bottle is… blue. And white. It… starts with an ‘A’, I believe. Amlodipine? Is that… correct? It is… hard to remember these things.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that’s correct! And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a… a bad reaction to anything. No… no allergies. I like flowers, you know. My wife… she loved flowers. We had a garden… a beautiful garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. And, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Amlodipine?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… sometimes I take something for my joints. They ache, you know, especially in the cold weather. It is… a cream. I rub it on my knees and hands. And… sometimes a vitamin D pill, the doctor told me to take it in the winter. But… that is all, I think. Just the cream and the vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a cream for joint pain and Vitamin D in the winter. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions… hmm. My mother… she had some trouble remembering things towards the end of her life. Not like me, I think. More… confused. She would… repeat herself, often. The doctor said… something about her mind. But I do not remember the exact name. My father… he was always very strong, very healthy. No… no problems with his mind that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother experienced some memory issues later in life, but you don’t recall a specific diagnosis. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no. Never smoked. My wife… she hated smoking. I tried it once, when I was young, but… I did not like it. And… I drink a little wine, sometimes. With dinner. Just one glass. Maybe two, on special occasions. And… no, no recreational drugs. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional social drinking. And finally, before we do a brief physical exam, can you tell me about your typical diet and exercise habits?
PATIENT: Diet… well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, fruits. Fish, sometimes. I like to cook, you know. My wife… she taught me. I used to make her breakfast every morning. Exercise… not much anymore. I used to walk a lot, before… before she passed away. Now… now I mostly sit. It is… hard to find the motivation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a relatively healthy diet, but limited exercise currently. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Sherrell. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general sense of your overall health. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment, which will involve some simple memory and balance tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is… best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I… I want to understand what is happening. It is… frightening, this forgetting.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that's not entirely unexpected. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to do a few simple tests to assess your memory and balance. I'm going to ask you to repeat three words, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes, I can repeat them. Apple, table, penny. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Take your time, no rush.
PATIENT: Hmm… backwards… That is… difficult. Let me see. D-l-r-o-w… is that… correct? No. That does not sound right. W-o-r-l-d… backwards… I… I cannot remember. I am sorry. It is… gone.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. It’s okay. These tests can be challenging. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. And finally, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: I… I can walk. But… I feel a little… dizzy. It is… difficult to balance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell, please sit down. That's enough for now. Thank you for your cooperation. The exam findings, along with your history, give me some important information to work with. It appears you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, including problems with recent memory, word recall, and some balance issues. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and those factors can contribute to cognitive decline. While these findings don’t necessarily point to a specific diagnosis, they do warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a better look at your brain structure and rule out any other potential causes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A brain scan…? That sounds… a little frightening. But… if it will help me understand what is happening… then yes. Yes, I am comfortable with that. I… I want to know. I want to understand why I am forgetting. And… what can be done about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We’ll get those tests scheduled as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, who specializes in memory disorders. She’ll be able to conduct a more comprehensive evaluation and help us develop a treatment plan. I will also prescribe you a medication to help manage your blood pressure, as keeping it under control is important for your overall health and cognitive function. I'm also going to recommend some lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, like puzzles or reading, can also help keep your brain active. I understand this is a lot to take in, Sherrell. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions…? Yes. Dr. Sharma… is she… good? And… what kind of treatment plan? Will it… help me remember? And… the medication… will it make me feel… different? I… I do not want to feel worse.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Sherrell. Dr. Sharma is an outstanding neurologist, highly respected in the field of memory disorders. She's very thorough and compassionate, and I have complete confidence in her ability to provide you with excellent care. As for the treatment plan, it will depend on the results of the tests and Dr. Sharma’s evaluation. It could include medication, cognitive therapy, lifestyle modifications, and support groups. The goal of the treatment plan is to slow down the progression of cognitive decline and help you maintain your independence and quality of life for as long as possible. While we can't guarantee that the treatment plan will restore your memory completely, it can definitely help manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being. The medication I'm prescribing is a common blood pressure medication. Some people experience mild side effects, like dizziness or fatigue, but these are usually temporary and can be managed by adjusting the dosage. It is important to remember that keeping your blood pressure under control is essential for your brain health, and this medication can help achieve that. If you experience any significant side effects, please contact me immediately. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. It is… a lot to think about. Dr. Sharma… I will trust your judgment. And the medication… I will try it. I… I want to do everything I can to… to feel better. To remember. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I understand this is a challenging time, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. I’m going to have my nurse, Maria, come in and give you the prescriptions and schedule your appointment with Dr. Sharma. She’ll also go over some resources that may be helpful. I’ll also send a copy of my findings to Dr. Sharma. Do you have any concerns about getting to your appointments?
PATIENT: No… my neighbor, Mr. Henderson, he is… very kind. He offers to drive me. He is… a good man. No, I will be alright getting there. Thank you for asking. I… I think that is all.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, Sherrell, Maria will be in shortly. In the meantime, please take your time and rest. Remember, we're working together on this, and I’m here to answer any questions that may come up. We'll get to the bottom of this, and we'll find the best way to manage your condition. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. If anything changes before then, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. .
PATIENT: .
