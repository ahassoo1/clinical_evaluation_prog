DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Beinborn. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s this tiredness, okay? Just…so tired. And…I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, exactly. It just…happens. I don't know why I do it, and honestly, I don’t want to talk about it much. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and… you mentioned eating dirt. I understand you don't want to dwell on that, and we can certainly focus on the tiredness first, if you prefer. Just to clarify – and please correct me if I’m misunderstanding – is this tiredness something that's come on recently, or has it been a long-term issue?
PATIENT: Long-term. Always been a bit tired, to be honest. But it’s…worse now. Much worse. Like I can barely get through the day. And the…clay thing is new, I guess. Maybe a few months. Don’t ask me details, I don’t remember. I just want some energy back. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so long-term tiredness that’s recently worsened, and this…clay consumption has been happening for a few months. I understand you don’t want to go into a lot of detail about that. That's perfectly alright. When you say “worse,” can you describe what that looks like?
PATIENT: It means I can’t…focus. I used to be good with numbers, programming, you know? CNC stuff. Now…everything’s a fog. And I sleep, like, ten hours and still feel like I haven’t slept at all. And I get…irritable. Everything annoys me. My late husband…he used to say I was a bear. Don't know why I'm telling you that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty focusing, despite sleeping a long time, and increased irritability. It sounds frustrating. And I appreciate you sharing that about your husband – it gives me a better sense of what this is like for you. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I just told you about the tiredness and…the dirt. I don't sit around analyzing everything. I work, I eat, I sleep. Sometimes I watch the news, but it just makes me mad. Honestly, I don't have time for a whole health report.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re busy, and you’re focused on getting some answers about the tiredness. Let's try this: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Weight…maybe? I don’t really look at the scale. Clothes feel a bit tighter, I guess. And I used to not crave…weird stuff. Now I want…I don't know, things that aren't food. Like, I used to just want a normal dinner. Now…it’s hard to explain. Not the clay, other things. I don't want to get into it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some potential weight gain, and changes in your cravings – things other than “normal food.” I won't push you for details if you don’t want to share them. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. My back aches a little sometimes, but that's just…old age, I guess. I used to do a lot of lifting at the shop. Nothing major. I'm not one to complain about a little discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild back discomfort. Now, thinking about your medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Now you want my whole life story? Look, I'm a practical person. I go to the doctor when something's wrong. I don't have a list of what I might have. The usual, I suppose. A cold now and then. Nothing serious. My husband always took care of the paperwork, I never paid attention.
DOCTOR: I apologize. You’re right, I’m asking a lot of broad questions, and it sounds like you’re not one for keeping detailed medical records. We can focus on what's happening now. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Once. Years ago. Appendicitis. That's it. Routine. Quick. No big deal. And honestly, I try not to dwell on unpleasant things. I'm busy enough as it is. Is this going to take much longer? I got a deadline.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy some time ago. I understand you're busy and have a deadline. Let's see if we can narrow things down. Do you take any medications currently – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. Never been much of a pill person. I don't like the way they make me feel. And honestly, I've always been pretty healthy. Or was pretty healthy. Before all this tiredness, and…you know. I just take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just a multivitamin occasionally. Now, this may be a bit sensitive, but are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? I get a little itchy sometimes with certain plants, but nothing serious. Not like, anaphylactic shock or anything. And honestly, I’ve got bigger things to worry about than a little itching. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, mild seasonal itching. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history, if that’s alright. Did any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family? Honestly, I don't talk to my family much. Not close. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father…he was just a grumpy old man. Not sure what he died of. Look, I'm not a genealogist. I'm a programmer. Is this relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had high blood pressure, father’s health history is unknown. That's helpful, thank you. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. I need a clear head for my work. Alcohol makes me foggy, and smoking is disgusting. I don't need any vices to slow me down. I have things to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. That’s good to know. Alright. So, long-term tiredness that's recently worsened, some clay consumption, potential weight gain, changes in cravings, and a family history of high blood pressure. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. But don't poke around too much. And be quick about it, okay? I really do have to go.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just a quick listen and a few gentle checks. Please lie back on the exam table. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 145/90. A little elevated. Abdomen is soft, but there's some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. No masses felt. Okay. Blood pressure is a little high, and there's some tenderness in your upper right abdomen. It's not a significant amount of pain, but it’s worth noting. Given what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I think it would be best to run some blood tests. Specifically, I'd like to check your complete blood count, your liver function, your kidney function, your thyroid levels, and your iron levels. This will help us rule out a number of potential causes for your tiredness and abdominal tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests? Seriously? Look, I hate needles. And I don’t do well with waiting for results. I got things to do now, not sit around stressing about bloodwork. But fine, if you think it's necessary. Just…make it quick. And tell me the results as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to needles, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll get the results back as soon as we can, typically within a few days. In the meantime, I also want to discuss the…clay consumption. While I understand you don’t want to dwell on it, it's important to address. It could be a sign of iron deficiency, a condition called pica, or something else entirely. I'm not trying to pry, but have you noticed any cravings for other non-food items?
PATIENT: Ugh. Non-food items? Look, I already said I have other cravings, okay? Things I'm not going to list. And honestly, it’s embarrassing. Just leave it alone. Seriously. This is getting ridiculous. It’s tiredness. I want to know why I’m tired. Focus on that. And stop asking about the dirt.
DOCTOR: Okay, I respect your boundaries and won't press further about the clay consumption at this time. We’ll focus on the tiredness and what the blood tests reveal. Given your blood pressure reading and the tiredness, and while we wait for the blood work, I’m going to recommend a few lifestyle changes. First, try to reduce your stress levels. I know that's easier said than done, but chronic stress can contribute to both tiredness and high blood pressure. Second, make sure you're getting enough sleep – aim for at least seven to eight hours per night. And third, try to incorporate regular exercise into your routine – even a short walk each day can make a difference. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Exercise? I barely have time to sleep. And reduce stress? I am stressed. I got deadlines, and now I got this tiredness. It's just...a lot. Honestly, it sounds like you're blaming me for being tired. Look, I need a solution, not a lecture about exercise. Can we just get to the blood tests?
DOCTOR: I apologize if it came across that way. I'm not blaming you, and I understand you're overwhelmed. I’m simply trying to offer some potential coping mechanisms while we work to determine the underlying cause of your tiredness. Yes, let's focus on the blood tests. I’ll write the order now, and then the nurse will come in to draw the samples. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just...hurry. And tell the nurse to be gentle. Seriously. And no poking around.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll make a note for the nurse. I’ll let her know to be as quick and gentle as possible and to avoid any unnecessary poking. I’ll step out now to finish up the paperwork, and she’ll be in shortly. Do you have any other questions or concerns before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions while she’s drawing your blood. .
