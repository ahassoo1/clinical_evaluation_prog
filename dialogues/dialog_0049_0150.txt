DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day, so let’s get straight to it. I want to have a baby. And I want it to be…easy. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I hear stories, and frankly, I’d like to avoid any…complications. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: “Easy” isn’t a medical term we typically use, Ms. Shteynberg. But I understand your concerns about time. Conceiving can be straightforward for some, but it’s rarely guaranteed. To assess your situation properly, I’ll need some information. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Medical history. Fine. Yes, once. A long time ago. It…didn’t work out. It was…complicated. And frankly, I don’t particularly want to relive the details. What does that even matter now? I need to know what you can do to make sure this one does work, and quickly. Are you going to ask me about every little ache and pain from twenty years ago?
DOCTOR: It matters because past pregnancies can give us clues, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m not going to dwell on details, but certain complications do increase the risk of recurrence. However, we can certainly focus on the present and future. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I keep myself in good shape. I work with bicycles all day, it’s hardly a sedentary lifestyle. And I eat reasonably well. Look, I’m a strong, healthy woman. I don't need a list of problems. Just tell me what tests you want to run so we can get this process started. Is there a blood test? Something that will give us answers?
DOCTOR: Very well. We can certainly start with blood work. It will assess your hormone levels, check for immunity to certain infections, and give us a baseline understanding of your overall health. We’ll also need a urine sample. And, I’m afraid, a pelvic exam is standard procedure. It allows me to assess the health of your reproductive organs. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’m not one of those delicate flowers. And a…pelvic exam? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, I understand you're the doctor and all, but…it seems rather intrusive. Couldn't we skip that part? I assure you, everything is perfectly…functional. Honestly, the less poking around, the better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, a pelvic exam is not simply about confirming things are “functional”. It’s a vital part of assessing your reproductive health and identifying any potential issues that might hinder conception. It allows me to check for fibroids, cysts, or any other abnormalities. I understand your discomfort, but I am obligated to provide thorough care. I can certainly be as gentle as possible. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, obligated. Right. Look, I’m paying you, aren’t I? Fine. Do what you have to do. But I'm warning you, if you find anything, I expect a clear explanation. No medical jargon, please. As for medications… I take a multivitamin. And sometimes, if my back aches from lifting heavy bikes, I'll take ibuprofen. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, this is all rather… tiresome.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin and ibuprofen. Noted. Alright. Before we proceed with the exam, let's briefly discuss your cycle. When was your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. My cycle. Really? Do you need the exact date? It was…around the beginning of July, I think. Honestly, I don’t keep a detailed calendar. It comes and goes. I'm not exactly tracking ovulation or anything ridiculous like that. I just…expect it to happen. Is that a problem? I'm a busy woman, I don't have time for charts and graphs. Do you really need a precise date?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a general timeframe, Ms. Shteynberg. It helps us understand your hormone levels and timing of potential ovulation. It's not about charts and graphs, it’s about information. Now, do you have any family history of early menopause, or any reproductive issues like endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, heavens. My mother had…problems. Vague problems. She didn’t talk about it much. Something about…hot flashes and moods. And my sister… she had trouble getting pregnant, but she eventually did. After years of… fussing. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I’m not a genealogist. I can tell you my grandmother was a strong woman who lived to be ninety, if that helps. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Vague problems, trouble getting pregnant. Noted. Alright. We’ll proceed with the physical exam. Please change into a gown, and we'll start with a basic assessment of your height and weight. Then we’ll move onto the pelvic exam. I’ll explain everything as we go. It will be most informative.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. And try to be quick about it. I have things to do. Don’t expect a lot of pleasantries.
