DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. Welcome. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this pain, you see. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. “A little while now…” Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably… oh, maybe three or four weeks? It started kinda dull, just a little ache, and I didn't think much of it. But it’s gotten sharper lately. It’s really bothering me when I try to… well, when I move around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four weeks, starting as a dull ache and now sharper with movement. Can you point to where you're feeling the pain?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. Lower back, kinda on the left side. Sometimes it feels like it goes around a bit, but mostly right here. It's a deep ache, but when I bend over or twist, oof, it really stings.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, mostly on the left, and it’s a stinging pain with bending and twisting. Have you noticed anything that makes it feel better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… resting, definitely. When I just sit or lie down, it calms down a lot. And warm baths help too, for a little while anyway. But it always comes back when I start doing things. It doesn’t really go away completely, just… less bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, resting and warm baths provide some relief. Has the pain been radiating anywhere – down your leg, or into your hips, perhaps?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Sometimes I get a tingling feeling down my left leg, not all the way to my foot, but kinda in the back of my thigh. It’s not constant, though. Just now and then. It’s hard to explain. It's not like a shooting pain, more of a… weird feeling. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Tingling in the back of your left thigh, coming and going. Okay. Now, thinking about other things… have you had any trouble with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a… personal question! No, no trouble there, Doctor. Everything’s… normal, thankfully. Just the pain in my back, that's all. Is that tingling something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: No, it's a good question to ask, and I appreciate you answering. The tingling is something we'll explore. Now, have you had any injuries to your back in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… Not that I remember, not a serious one anyway. I used to do a lot of gardening when I was younger, lots of bending and lifting. Maybe I pulled something back then, a long time ago. But I don't recall a specific injury. Just getting older, I guess! Is that what this is? Old age catching up?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Mr. Way. Gardening definitely involves a lot of strain on the back. Do you currently have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it’s under control now with the medication. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat right, you know? And I walk a little every day, when the pain lets me. I don't have arthritis or anything like that. I just… ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure. And you’re walking when you can. Have you tried any medications or treatments for this back pain besides the warm baths?
PATIENT: No, not yet, Doctor. I figured I'd see what you thought before starting anything. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it, you know? I was hoping it would just go away on its own. That’s why I waited so long to come in. I just figured it was a muscle strain or something.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No medications yet. Okay, Mr. Way, I’m going to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, Mr. Way, when I press here on the left side, does that feel particularly tender?
PATIENT: Oof! Yes, right there. That's it. That’s definitely where it hurts the most. It's a sharp pain, not just a dull ache. That's the spot.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when I ask you to lift your left leg while lying flat, do you feel any pain radiating down your leg?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A little bit. Not a shooting pain, like I said before, but a stretching feeling, kinda like a pull, down the back of my thigh. It's not terrible, but I definitely feel it. It feels… tighter when I do that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And your reflexes seem normal, and muscle strength is good. I don't hear anything unusual when I listen to your back. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have a pinched nerve in your lower back, likely caused by some irritation or inflammation. It’s hard to say definitively without further testing. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. A pinched nerve, you say? That sounds… not good. What does that mean? And what kind of testing would I need? Is it something serious? I just want to be able to garden again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's understandable you're concerned, Mr. Way. A pinched nerve just means a nerve is being compressed, and that can cause pain, tingling, and weakness. It's not necessarily serious, and many cases improve with conservative treatment, like physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. We can start with an X-ray to rule out any structural issues, and if that doesn’t give us enough information, we could consider an MRI to get a better look at the nerves and discs in your back. Before we order those tests, I'd like to try a short course of an anti-inflammatory medication to see if that provides some relief. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. If it could help, I'd be willing to try it. I really just want to feel better. And I do trust your judgment, Doctor. What kind of medication is it? And are there any side effects I should be aware of? I always worry about those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll start with Ibuprofen, 600mg three times a day with food. It’s an over-the-counter medication, but at this dosage, it’s best to take it as prescribed. Common side effects are stomach upset, heartburn, or nausea. It's important to take it with food to minimize those effects. Less common, but more serious, side effects can include stomach ulcers or kidney problems, which is why it's important to let me know if you experience any unusual symptoms, like black, tarry stools or swelling in your ankles. I'm also going to give you a handout with some gentle stretches you can do at home to help relieve the pressure on your back. I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or twisting for the next week or so. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a plan, Doctor. Ibuprofen, stretches, and follow up in two weeks. I can do all of that. I'll be careful with the lifting and twisting, and I'll definitely let you know if I have any problems. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. I'll have the nurse bring in the handout and a prescription for the Ibuprofen. If anything changes or gets worse before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Beinborn. You too. I will. I'll see you in two weeks.
