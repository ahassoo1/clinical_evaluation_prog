DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Been happening a few days now. I take pills, you see. For my arthritis. The red ones. Lots of them. Don't know what they're called exactly, but the doctor keeps prescribing them. It’s probably that, isn’t it? I just want to know what I need to do about it. Don't have all day for this, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Black stools can be concerning, Mrs. Hatchard, and it's good you're getting it checked out. It could be related to your medication, yes, but we need to rule other things out. “Lots of red pills” isn't terribly helpful, I'm afraid. Do you happen to remember the name on the bottle, or perhaps the name of the doctor who prescribed them?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You’d think they’d write it bigger on the bottle. Let me think… Dr. Kowalski. Yes, Dr. Kowalski, over on Elm Street. He's a good doctor, but… forgetful, I think. The pills… they're small, red, and I take… oh, goodness… at least four a day. Maybe six. It's something-profen, I think? Starts with an "s". Ibu-profen? No, that doesn't sound right. Look, are you going to fix this or just ask me questions? It’s not like I memorize everything.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is a possibility, yes. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mrs. Hatchard. It’s important to have accurate information, and I assure you, I’m trying to help. Now, black stools usually indicate bleeding somewhere in the digestive tract. It could be something minor, but we need to investigate. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Good heavens. Well, no. Not that I’ve seen. I don’t go poking around in… well, you know. But I have been a bit tired lately. And my stomach… it’s been a little off. Not pain, exactly. More like… unsettled. Like I need to go to the bathroom a lot. But I figured that was just the pills too. Honestly, I take so many pills, it’s hard to keep track of what’s normal anymore. Are you saying I’m… bleeding inside? That sounds awful.
DOCTOR: It could be, Mrs. Hatchard, and that's precisely why we need to do a proper assessment. "Tired" and "unsettled stomach" are rather vague symptoms, I must say. Let's start with a physical examination. I'll listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll need to do a rectal exam to check for any obvious signs of blood. It’s standard procedure, and quite necessary.
PATIENT: A… a what exam? Absolutely not! Look here, young lady, I am not going to… poke around down there. I came in here because my stool is black, not for a… a bottom inspection. I’ve lived seventy-three years, and I know when something isn’t right. And my bottom feels perfectly fine! Are there no other ways to figure this out? I'm not comfortable with that at all. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Hatchard, with all due respect, a digital rectal exam is a crucial part of evaluating the cause of black stools. It allows me to directly assess for any abnormalities. I understand your discomfort, but refusing a necessary examination severely limits my ability to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure your well-being. We could order a stool test to look for blood, but that takes time, and a negative result doesn’t necessarily rule everything out. I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you continue to refuse, I can document your refusal and we can discuss alternative, though less thorough, investigations. However, I must warn you that this may delay a proper diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Fine! Fine, do your little… exam. But don’t go poking around too much. And hurry up about it. I have things to do, you know. This whole thing is a waste of my time, but if you insist... just get it over with. And please, try not to make a mess. I don’t want to spend the rest of the day cleaning up. Honestly, the things I have to put up with these days… .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up. I’ll explain each step as I go. It will only take a moment. Hmm. The stool was dark, as you described, and there’s some… dryness. No obvious bright red blood, but that doesn’t rule out bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. I’ll need to order a complete blood count and a stool occult blood test, and I’m also going to order a test to rule out Helicobacter pylori infection.
