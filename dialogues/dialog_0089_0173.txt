DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor, nice to meet you too. Well, I've just been getting these chills, you know? It's a bit odd, honestly. Not a fever or anything, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills without a fever. That is a bit unusual. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Um, sure. They come and go, really. Sometimes it's just a shiver, other times I feel properly cold, like I need a blanket. It doesn’t seem to be at a specific time of day, and it's not like I've been out in the cold or anything. Just…random.
DOCTOR: Random chills, alright. And how long have you been experiencing these?
PATIENT: Hmm... probably for about a week, maybe a little longer? It started gradually, I didn't really pay much attention at first, thought it was just being a bit tired. But it's not going away, so I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week. Any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, no. I’ve been a bit tired, but honestly, who isn't? Maybe a little bit of a headache a couple of times, but nothing major. No cough, no sore throat, no aches or anything like that. Just the chills and a bit of tiredness, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, sore throat, or aches… Good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yes! Now that you mention it, I haven't been as hungry as usual. And I think I might have lost a tiny bit of weight, but I haven't weighed myself properly to be sure. It's probably nothing, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced appetite and possible slight weight loss. I’m noting that. Any stress or big changes happening in your life lately?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, yeah. A fair bit, actually. The divorce is still pretty recent, so things are a bit… unsettled, you know? Trying to sort everything out is stressful, and it's been a bit lonely, to be honest. But I'm managing, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can definitely affect your body in lots of ways. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had a bad bout of flu a couple of years ago, but that’s it. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. No allergies that I know of, and I don’t take any regular medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known medical conditions, allergies, or medications. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Nothing like that. I’ve been lucky so far, touch wood!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your family. Is there any history of medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... My mum has high blood pressure, and my grandfather had diabetes, but other than that, not really. Nothing major that I know of. My dad's side of the family, I don't see them much, so I don't really know their medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your mum, diabetes in your grandfather. Noted. Now, just a couple more questions. Regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine at a special occasion, that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. That's helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Absolutely. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your temperature is normal, 98.6 Fahrenheit. Pulse is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 118 over 78, which is good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt at all. That feels fine. Everything seems okay so far, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Everything feels normal so far. Given your symptoms – chills, fatigue, reduced appetite, slight weight loss – and the fact that the exam is normal, it could be a number of things. It could be a mild viral infection that’s just lingering, or potentially related to the stress you're under. However, to be on the safe side, I’d like to run some blood tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. That sounds sensible. I'd rather be safe than sorry, so please do. What kind of tests are you thinking? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your organ function, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid issues. We’ll also check your Vitamin D levels, as low Vitamin D can sometimes cause fatigue and chills. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Perfect, actually. That covers everything, I think. So, just a standard blood draw, then? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, a standard blood draw. The lab is just down the hall. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and they'll send the results to me. I usually get them back within 24-48 hours. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, make sure you’re getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything really well, Doctor. Thank you so much for being so thorough and patient with me. I feel a lot better knowing we're getting it checked out. I'll go and get the blood tests done now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. Just head down the hall to the lab and let them know Dr. Roseburrough sent you. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before I get the results back. I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Okay, wonderful. Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Jailenne. Take care.
