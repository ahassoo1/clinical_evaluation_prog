DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me – in as concise a manner as possible, if you don't mind – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t really do doctors. It’s just… my husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your husband's concern is… noted. High blood pressure is not something to be dismissed lightly, regardless of one's personal preferences regarding medical attention. The nurse provided me with a preliminary reading, yes. But I need to establish a baseline myself and understand the context. Can you tell me, when did you first become aware of this… elevated reading?
PATIENT: Aware? I don’t do readings. The nurse took it yesterday, I guess. Before that… I haven’t a clue. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: "Perfectly fine" is… subjective, Ms. Dudeney. High blood pressure often presents with no symptoms, which is precisely why it’s so dangerous. It's a silent condition. Yesterday was the first measurement ever?
PATIENT: Yes. As far as I know. Look, I went for a routine check-up because my insurance requires it. They took my blood pressure. The nurse said it was a little high and sent me to you. That's it. I don't go to doctors unless someone makes me. It's a waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Very well. A singular reading is… insufficient, naturally. We will repeat the measurement. Please remain seated and try to relax. Now, while I do this, can you tell me about any family history of hypertension, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hypertension? Is that… high blood pressure? My grandma, on my mom’s side… she had something with her heart. She was older, though. Really old. And my uncle… he smoked. A lot. He had a stroke, I think. But that was his own fault. Does that count? I really don't know medical things.
DOCTOR: Yes, hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure. And your grandmother’s cardiac history, as well as your uncle’s stroke… are relevant. While lifestyle choices certainly contribute, there is often a genetic predisposition. Your blood pressure is elevated. 148 over 92. Again, a single reading is not definitive, but it warrants further investigation. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t believe in all that stuff. My husband tries to get me to take vitamins, but I refuse. He's always fussing about something. I eat… normally. I guess. Is that bad? I didn’t know eating could give you high blood pressure. What causes it, exactly? If it’s not from smoking or… vitamins.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, the etiology of hypertension is… multifactorial. It’s not simply a matter of “smoking or vitamins.” It involves genetics, lifestyle, diet, stress, kidney function… a whole constellation of factors. And frankly, refusing medical intervention when indicated is… unwise. Now, let's move on. What is your typical diet like?
PATIENT: Typical? I eat what’s made. My husband does most of the cooking. He likes meat, potatoes, and… casseroles. Lots of casseroles. And bread. I like bread. We don’t really eat… salads. Or vegetables. I had a tomato once, I think. He makes good pies, though. Apple and cherry. Those are healthy, right? Fruit is healthy.
DOCTOR: While fruit does contain vitamins, a diet primarily consisting of meat, potatoes, casseroles, and bread… is not conducive to cardiovascular health. It’s… suboptimal. Do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity? You mean… like exercise? No. I have a job. I’m on my feet all day at construction sites. That's enough activity, isn't it? Running around looking at blueprints and… telling people what to do. It's tiring. I go home and sit down. That's my exercise. It’s hot out there, too. Really hot.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, while your occupation undoubtedly requires physical exertion, it is not the same as dedicated cardiovascular exercise. The type of activity matters. Now, before we proceed any further, I need to ask about your social habits. Do you consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. At parties. Or with dinner. My husband likes wine. I might have a glass with him. Occasionally. I don't get drunk or anything. Just a little. To be polite. Is that bad? I don't smoke, if that matters. He used to, but he quit years ago. Does being around a smoker for a long time count?
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption is… less concerning than heavy drinking, naturally. And your prior exposure to your husband’s smoking is… noted, though its impact is likely minimal at this point. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. I get a cold sometimes, like everyone else. And I pulled a muscle in my back at work last year, but it got better. That's it. I don't like going to doctors, remember? I avoid it when I can. I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your history – or rather, your lack of history – and your recent blood pressure reading, I recommend a trial of lifestyle modifications. Increased physical activity, a reduction in sodium and processed foods, and a more balanced diet. I will also prescribe a low-dose diuretic to help manage your blood pressure. We will re-evaluate in one month. If your blood pressure remains elevated, we may need to consider further testing, such as an echocardiogram. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A diuretic? Is that… a water pill? I don’t want to take pills. That's what I was afraid of. I told you I don't like going to doctors! I guess… what kind of exercise? And what kind of foods should I avoid exactly? Are pies okay? My husband makes a really good cherry pie. .
DOCTOR: Yes, a diuretic is a water pill. It helps your body eliminate excess sodium and fluid, which can lower your blood pressure. As for exercise… brisk walking for 30 minutes, most days of the week. Avoid processed foods, excessive salt, sugary drinks, and red meat. And, Ms. Dudeney… pies, unfortunately, are not recommended. Follow these instructions, schedule a follow-up appointment, and please… try to take this seriously.
