DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 62 years old. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Yes, sixty-two… though sometimes it feels like much more! Well, to be frank, it’s this pain. Lower down, you see. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it’s quite severe. I believe my previous doctor mentioned something about… lupus? Is that right? It's all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. I’m not very good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if details are hazy; that’s what I’m here for. Lupus is a possibility, yes, and it’s good you have some prior medical history, even if fragmented. To clarify, Ms. Glymph, when did this pain begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it begin… That's a difficult question, Doctor. It feels like… years, honestly. Perhaps two or three? It started subtly, a little discomfort here and there, easily dismissed. But it's gotten worse over time, more frequent, and… sharper. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact date. I’ve been trying to keep track, but… well, you know. It slips my mind. Is it important to know precisely when it started? Perhaps focusing on how it feels now would be more helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know when it started, Ms. Glymph, but how it feels now is equally, if not more, important. We can certainly focus on the current symptoms if pinpointing the exact start date proves difficult. You mentioned it's become sharper. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Sharper… yes, that’s a good way to put it. It’s not a constant ache, you understand. It comes in waves, almost. Like a tightening, a cramping… very low down, in the abdomen. And it radiates, sometimes. Goes down my thighs, a bit. When it’s really bad, it takes my breath away. It's… unsettling, to say the least. And it’s difficult to find a comfortable position. Lying down doesn’t always help, and sitting… well, sitting can make it worse. It’s a rather unpredictable pain, really. One moment I’m fine, the next… well, not so much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's a cramping, tightening pain, low in the abdomen, radiating down the thighs, occurring in waves, and made worse by sitting. It sounds quite debilitating when it flares up. Does anything relieve the pain, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Relieve it… That’s a good question. Honestly, not much, Doctor. Warm baths sometimes help a little, taking the edge off. And lying very still, but even that isn't always reliable. I've tried some over-the-counter pain relievers, you know, the ibuprofen… but they don't seem to touch it when it’s really bad. It just… has to run its course, I suppose. I've also noticed that… well, it seems to be worse after I’ve been… active. Even a simple walk can sometimes bring it on. It's a rather bothersome situation, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, warm baths provide minimal relief, over-the-counter pain relievers aren’t effective, and activity exacerbates the pain. Now, Ms. Glymph, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… That’s a bit of a tangle, Doctor. As I mentioned, I believe I was diagnosed with… something autoimmune, years ago. Lupus, perhaps? But honestly, I don't recall all the details. I saw a doctor regularly for a time, had some tests… but it was quite a while ago. I've also had… the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, managed with medication. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. I’ve never had any surgeries, if that’s helpful. And… oh dear, I’m afraid my memory is failing me. I’m sure there’s more, but it's all so… hazy. I apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Please don't apologize, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly alright. We have time, and we'll piece everything together. High blood pressure, managed with medication, a history of pneumonia, and a possible autoimmune diagnosis – that’s a good starting point. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s… lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, a good many years now. And… That’s all I can recall at the moment, Doctor. I also take a multivitamin, but that’s hardly relevant, is it? And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, a mild sleeping aid… but only occasionally. I’m afraid my mind is a bit of a sieve these days.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Lisinopril ten milligrams daily, and occasional use of a sleep aid. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. That's another good question. I don’t believe so, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to be a bit sensitive to pollen, in the spring, but that was when I was younger. A little sneezing, a runny nose… nothing serious. As far as medications go, I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions, to my knowledge. I've been fortunate in that regard, I suppose. I truly believe I’m allergy-free, but if I suddenly think of something, I’ll be sure to let you know.
DOCTOR: Very good. That’s helpful to know. Now, Ms. Glymph, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a rather complicated question, Doctor. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, from… I believe it was heart failure. And my father… he lived a long life, but he suffered from arthritis, quite badly, in his later years. As for siblings, I have one brother, but we haven't spoken in many years. He lives… far away, and we've drifted apart. As for other family members… I’m afraid I don’t know much about their medical histories. We weren’t a particularly close family, I’m afraid. It’s not much information, I’m afraid. But hopefully, it’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Glymph. History of heart failure in your mother and arthritis in your father. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, at my age, it's rather… subdued, Doctor. I live alone, in a small cottage in the suburbs. I enjoy gardening, when the weather permits. And I read… a great deal. Mostly historical novels, you see. It keeps my mind active. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol… perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, on occasion. I used to be quite active, when I was younger… enjoyed hiking and swimming. But my knees aren't what they used to be, I’m afraid. I try to eat a healthy diet… lots of fruits and vegetables. But I do have a fondness for sweets, I confess. It’s a simple life, but it’s a comfortable one.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Ms. Glymph. A quiet lifestyle, gardening, reading, no smoking, occasional alcohol, a fondness for sweets. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are there any specific concerns or questions you have for me at this point?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose my biggest concern is… what is causing this pain? I’m worried it’s something serious, you see. And I would like to know if there’s anything I can do to alleviate it… besides warm baths, of course. I’m also a little worried about the lupus… I remember my previous doctor mentioning it, but I don't recall the details. Is it something I should be concerned about? And… will I need more tests? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just want to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Glymph, and perfectly reasonable concerns. We'll certainly explore those together. Based on what you've told me, the pain's characteristics and your history do raise the possibility of several conditions, including, as you mentioned, a possible autoimmune process like lupus. However, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to perform a physical exam and, likely, some blood tests to get a clearer picture. The blood tests will help us rule out other potential causes and assess for signs of inflammation or autoimmune activity. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I understand we need more information. Blood tests… yes, that makes sense. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, and to understand what’s happening to my body. So, yes, let’s proceed with the exam and the tests. Please, tell me what to expect.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that, Ms. Glymph. I’ll perform a general physical exam, focusing on your abdomen and lower back. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. It may be slightly uncomfortable when I press on your abdomen, but please let me know if you experience any sharp or severe pain. After the exam, I'll draw some blood for the tests. It will take a few days to get the results back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I understand it may be a little uncomfortable, and I will certainly let you know if anything is too painful. A few days for the results… that’s perfectly acceptable. And a follow-up appointment… yes, that’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience with my… vagueness. Let’s proceed whenever you are ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. I’m happy to help. Let’s begin. Would you mind if I had you lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Not at all. Let me just… carefully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Just relax and try to take some deep breaths. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. I’ll be using a stethoscope, and it may be a little cool against your skin. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Breathing normally. It’s a little cool, yes, but not unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. I’m going to press on different areas to check for tenderness or any abnormalities. Please let me know if you feel any pain, and if so, where, and how severe it is – on a scale of one to ten, with one being very mild and ten being the worst pain imaginable. I’ll start gently on the left side.
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little tender there, Doctor. Perhaps a four? It's not sharp, but… it's definitely uncomfortable. A dull ache, really. Just a little further down… it feels a bit worse there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, definitely more tender there, Doctor. Perhaps a six or seven? It’s… a sharper pain there, a cramping sensation. It radiates slightly down my left thigh. It’s not excruciating, but it’s… quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I won't press there again. Now, I am going to check your reflexes. Would you mind extending your legs for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other leg…
PATIENT: Yes, I felt that. Both legs jerked, I think. It was… subtle, but yes, I felt it. Is that normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is normal, Ms. Glymph. Both reflexes were present and equal. That’s good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs again to make sure everything still sounds clear. Everything sounds normal. Alright, Ms. Glymph. That completes the physical exam. I'll now order some blood tests to help us get a better understanding of what's going on. These tests will check for inflammation, autoimmune markers, and other potential causes of your pain.
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Blood tests… yes. I hope they can shed some light on this. What kind of tests will you be ordering, exactly? And… will they be painful? I do tend to bruise easily, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the bruising, Ms. Glymph. We'll be careful. The tests I'm ordering include a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to check for inflammation, and an antinuclear antibody test to screen for autoimmune diseases. We may need to add more tests later depending on the results, but these are a good starting point. As for the pain, the blood draw itself can cause a brief pinch or sting, but it shouldn’t be anything significant. The phlebotomist will use a small needle to draw a sample of blood from your arm. Afterward, there may be some minor bruising or discomfort at the injection site, but it usually resolves within a few days. We’ll put pressure on the site afterward to minimize the bruising. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a lot of information, Doctor. A complete blood count… a metabolic panel… an antibody test… Perhaps you could explain the antibody test, if you don’t mind? What exactly does it look for? And what would a positive result mean? I apologize for being so… inquisitive. I just want to understand what’s happening to my body.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. That’s perfectly reasonable. The antinuclear antibody test looks for antibodies in your blood that attack the nucleus of your cells. The nucleus is the control center of your cells. A positive ANA test doesn't necessarily mean you have an autoimmune disease, but it can be a sign of one. It’s important to remember that a positive ANA test is just one piece of the puzzle. We’ll need to consider your symptoms, your medical history, and the results of other tests to make a diagnosis. If the ANA test is positive, we may need to order additional tests to determine the specific autoimmune disease, if any. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So, a positive test doesn't automatically mean I have something… it just means there’s a possibility? And you’ll need more tests to figure out what, specifically, is going on? Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. It’s… a little reassuring to know it’s not a definite diagnosis. It’s just… a possibility. Thank you for explaining that to me. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm glad I could clarify that for you. Now, let's get the blood draw done. I will write the lab order and you can head over there. They'll take care of the rest. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. Fifteen to twenty minutes… and then a follow-up appointment. Yes, that sounds good. Thank you again for your kindness and patience, Doctor. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm happy to help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll make a note in your chart about your tendency to bruise easily so the phlebotomist is aware. Get well soon, Ms. Glymph. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your reassurance. You have a wonderful day. .
