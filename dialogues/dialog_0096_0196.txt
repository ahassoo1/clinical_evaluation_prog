DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… well, a long time now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of dates so well anymore. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: "A long time," you say. Alright. And when you say draining, can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… It’s hard to explain. Like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting out of bed. And I don’t have the energy to… to do things I used to enjoy. I used to love gardening, but now… just thinking about it makes me feel worn out. It’s not like a muscle tiredness, it’s… inside tired, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Inside tired" is a good way to put it. And how is this tiredness affecting your day-to-day?
PATIENT: Oh, everything. I… I used to volunteer at the library, but I had to stop. Couldn’t concentrate. And cooking… forget about it. Mostly just…toast. My husband used to do most of the cooking anyway… It’s been a few years since he passed, though. So… it’s just me now. I mostly just… rest. Which doesn't help the tiredness, I guess. It’s a bit of a circle.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed recently that might have made this worse?
PATIENT: Changed…? Not really… No, I don’t think so. Everything’s pretty much the same. Same house, same routine… well, the routine is mostly resting, like I said. Oh! The pharmacy changed hands a couple of months ago, maybe? But that didn’t really affect me much, just a different face behind the counter. I don’t know if that matters. I get my medicine there, you know, with my Medicare. I can't really remember what I take… something for my blood pressure, I think?
DOCTOR: Right. We'll get to the medications in a moment. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Aside from the tiredness, are you experiencing any other problems?
PATIENT: Other problems… Hmm… Sometimes I feel a little dizzy, especially when I stand up too fast. And my memory’s not what it used to be, obviously. I already said that, didn’t I? Oh, and… sometimes my joints ache, a little bit. Mostly my knees and my hands. It’s not constant, just… comes and goes. Is that what you mean by problems? I don't know... it's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I mean. Alright. Let's get some basic information. Do you have any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing…? No, not really. I mean, I get a little winded if I walk up the stairs, but that's probably just because I’m not very active. I haven’t had any trouble… catching my breath, or anything. No wheezing or coughing. Just… tired when I exert myself. Is that what you’re asking? I'm not very good at explaining things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight…? Oh dear. I haven’t really been paying attention, to be honest. I think I might have lost a little bit, but I'm not sure. I don't weigh myself anymore. I used to, but… what's the point? It doesn't change anything. I eat… when I feel up to it. Mostly toast. I’m not a big eater these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Then we’ll take a look at your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds… fine. Just… please be quick? I have… things to do. Or, I would if I wasn’t so tired. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Take a deep breath in… and out. Good. Heart sounds are regular, though a little faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Not bad, but a little on the higher side. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit… uncomfortable. They feel a little stiff, you know? Not painful, exactly, but… creaky. Like an old door. I used to be able to do all sorts of things… gardening, dancing… now it's just… difficult. They're not swollen or anything, just… achey.
DOCTOR: There's a slight crepitus with range of motion, as you said. No significant swelling or warmth. Range of motion is limited, but not severely. Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Well, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems we have a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as vitamin deficiency, or perhaps early signs of osteoarthritis. But given your age and the persistent tiredness, we need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D levels. We should also check your blood sugar.
PATIENT: Blood work…? Oh dear. More tests. I don’t really like needles. But… if you think it’s necessary. When will I get the results? I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? And… is it going to be expensive? I'm on Medicare, but…
DOCTOR: It's necessary to get a proper diagnosis, Ms. Licano. The lab will bill Medicare directly; your co-pay will be whatever is standard for your plan. As for when you'll get the results, it usually takes a few days, maybe a week. The lab will contact you when they're ready. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you try to increase your protein intake. Toast isn't providing you with much sustenance. Try some eggs, fish, or chicken if you can manage it. And please try to get some gentle exercise, even just a short walk each day. It'll help with the tiredness. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… not that I know of. I haven't taken anything regularly in… well, since my husband passed. He always handled the medications. I think I had some penicillin as a child, but I don’t remember having a reaction. Just… a vague recollection. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Unless… maybe some sort of rash once? But it was years ago, and I don’t remember what caused it. It wasn't serious. Is that a problem? Should I try to remember?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be a problem, but it’s good to be certain. We'll note "no known drug allergies" for now. Alright, Ms. Licano, I've ordered the blood work. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. If the blood work is normal, we may need to consider further investigation, such as a referral to a specialist. In the meantime, try to get some rest, eat a balanced diet, and get some gentle exercise. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions…? Not really, I suppose. Just… when will I feel better? I’m just so tired all the time. It’s exhausting being exhausted, you know? And… will these tests find out what’s wrong? I just want to get back to… something. Anything. I think that’s all. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best to find out what's causing your tiredness, Ms. Licano. These tests are a good starting point. Try not to worry too much. We'll take things one step at a time. Alright, well, the nurse will give you the lab requisition form and instructions. Have a good day.
