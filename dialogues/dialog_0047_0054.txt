DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. I... cough a lot. Been coughing for a long time now. And I get tired easy. Also, my nose... always blocked, feels like. Get sick a lot, too. Like, sinus... infections, I think they call them? It's been going on and on. I don't really remember when it started, just... always.
DOCTOR: “Always” is a long time, Mr. Tati. Let's try to narrow that down a bit, shall we?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay. Maybe... a year? Or more? I work a lot with tires, you know? Dirty job. Maybe started around then? I'm not sure. Sorry, my head is not so good with dates. It just… feels like a long time. I keep taking medicine from the shop, but it doesn't really help much.
DOCTOR: Medicine from the shop?
PATIENT: Yeah… like, the little pharmacy near my workshop. They sell everything. Just cough syrup and… pain killers, mostly. Old Man Lim sells it. He says it helps with the cold. But the cough… it just keeps coming back. Maybe it's not the right stuff? I don't know anything about medicine, Doctor. Just trying to get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, taking medication from… an unregulated source isn't ideal, Mr. Tati. It’s difficult to know what you’re actually taking, or if it’s interacting with anything else. Let's get a proper history. You mentioned a cough, fatigue and nasal congestion… is the cough producing any mucus?
PATIENT: Mucus? Uh… yes. Sometimes. Not always a lot. Sometimes it’s… clear. Sometimes… yellow-ish. I think. It’s hard to tell. I just cough it up into a tissue. It’s not… bloody, if that’s what you’re asking? I don't know if that's important. Sorry. I'm not good at describing things. Feels like my chest is tight when I cough, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tightness in the chest is important. And the change in mucus color… that's good you noticed that. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes I feel warm. But I just thought it was the weather, you know? It’s hot, Malaysia is always hot. Chills… not really. Night sweats? Uh… maybe? My wife says I sometimes kick the blanket off, but she also says I'm a hot sleeper. I don't really pay attention. Sorry, I really don't know. I just feel tired and cough a lot. Is this… bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s concerning enough to investigate further, Mr. Tati. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we'll talk about some possible tests. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Is something wrong? I feel okay… just tired, like always. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound a bit congested, some wheezing on both sides. Your throat is a little red, but nothing remarkable. Ears are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated – 140 over 90 – but that could be from being nervous. Let me check your lymph nodes. Hmm. A few slightly enlarged lymph nodes, nothing drastically concerning at this point. Now, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. Just to rule things out, you understand.
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? I need to go back to work. My wife… she worries about money. Will this take long? And… how much will it cost? I don't have insurance, you see. I just fix tires. I don't have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Tati, but we need to be thorough. The X-ray will help us see if there's any infection in your lungs. The blood work will check for inflammation and other potential causes. As for the cost… without insurance, the X-ray will be around 80 ringgit, and the blood work approximately 150. I understand your concerns, and we'll keep it as minimal as possible. The lab is just down the hall. You’ll need to give them a sample, and it will take about an hour for the results. I'll see you back here once you’ve had the tests done. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Eighty… and one hundred and fifty ringgit? That… that's a lot of money, Doctor. I only make a little bit each day. Is there… anything else I can do? Maybe some medicine, just to try? I really need to go back to work. My wife… I understand you need to be thorough, but… is there any way to avoid the tests?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I appreciate your concerns, but I am a doctor. I cannot simply prescribe medicine without knowing what we are treating. Guessing could do more harm than good. Look, I can write you a prescription for a basic cough suppressant to tide you over, but it's just masking the symptoms. The X-ray and blood work are essential to rule out anything serious – pneumonia, bronchitis, even something more concerning. If it turns out to be nothing, then at least we’ve ruled it out. However, without these tests, I cannot responsibly provide any further treatment. It’s 230 ringgit, Mr. Tati. That’s the price of peace of mind.
PATIENT: Two hundred and thirty… Okay, Doctor. Okay. I… I will try to find the money. My wife… she will help. Just… please, tell me if it’s something bad. I need to know. And… can I get a note, maybe, for the shop? To explain why I was away for so long? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. Here's a prescription for the cough suppressant, and here's a note for your employer. The lab is just down the hall, tell them Dr. Press sent you. They'll take care of everything. And I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. We'll do everything we can to get you back on your feet. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare for my next appointment. Please come back once you've had the tests done, and we'll discuss the results. .
