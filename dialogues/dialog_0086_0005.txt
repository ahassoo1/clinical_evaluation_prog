DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here because I am considering a move to a senior living facility. They requested a check-up to be sure I am… suitable, I suppose is the word they used. I understand this is quite standard.
DOCTOR: Standard, yes. Though frankly, relying on their judgment is… questionable. Still. A pre-placement exam. Alright. So, you're feeling generally well enough to consider such a transition?
PATIENT: Generally well, yes. Though my bones do ache a bit more than they used to, especially after a long day in the bakery. I still manage to get everything done, mind you. Knead the dough, shape the loaves… everything. It just takes a little longer, that’s all. I wouldn’t want them thinking I’m incapable, you understand. I still have a good life, and I want to continue having a good life.
DOCTOR: A bakery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have owned and operated Tkac’s Bakery for… well, for nearly sixty years now. My father before me, and his father before him. We specialize in traditional Lakota breads, though I make a good sourdough as well, if I do say so myself. It keeps me busy, and it keeps me connected to my heritage. It’s a good life, a good life indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sixty years in the bakery. That's… dedication. And potentially a lot of strain on your musculoskeletal system. We’ll need to assess that. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. Dr. Emily Carter, out by the reservation. She’s been my doctor for… oh, goodness, nearly thirty years now. I see her twice a year, for my check-ups. She’s a good woman, very thorough. I’ll happily provide her contact information, if you wish. She knows my history better than I do, I suspect. Though, as I said before, my memory is rather good. I can recall most of it myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be helpful. Her contact information, please. And while I appreciate your… confidence in your memory, Mr. Tkac, it’s standard procedure to verify. Have you been hospitalized for anything in the last five years?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Her number is 605-555-1234. As for hospitalizations… let me see. No, not in the last five years. Or ten, for that matter. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, but that was… oh, goodness, over sixty years ago now! A minor incident, really. A bit of pain, a quick surgery, and I was back to kneading dough in no time. No serious illnesses, no major surgeries, no broken bones… nothing of that sort. I’ve always been a healthy man, all things considered. I hope that is reassuring.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Appendix removed decades ago. We'll note that. Any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… that is to say, long-lasting conditions? Let me think. Dr. Carter diagnosed me with mild arthritis in my hands a few years back, which, as I mentioned, explains some of the stiffness. It flares up occasionally, especially in cold weather. I manage it with some cream and by not overdoing it. Otherwise… no. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no lung problems, no… anything of that nature. I take a daily vitamin, and that’s about it. I pride myself on being a fairly… uncomplicated patient, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mild arthritis. Noted. And just to be thorough, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I am aware of. I’ve taken various medications over the years—antibiotics for infections, pain relievers for minor aches—and never had a reaction. As a young man, I was stung by a bee, and had a bit of swelling, but I don’t believe that qualifies as a true allergy. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Perhaps she was right. I've always been lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a physical examination, then. I need to assess your range of motion, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Please sit up on the examination table. And if you could just loosen your shirt, that would be helpful.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A physical examination is perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for thoroughness. I've always taken care of my body, you see. It's been a good servant to me for many years. Though it's not quite as nimble as it once was, I admit. I trust your assessment will be… fair.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, please. In… and out… Good. Heart sounds are… within normal limits, though slightly diminished. Again, deep breaths… and out… Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there is some mild decreased breath sound at the bases. I’ll need to check your reflexes now. Please keep your arm relaxed.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I am doing my best to cooperate. I always took pride in my lung capacity – necessary for a good bellow when stoking the bakery ovens, you see. Diminished breath sounds… that doesn’t sound particularly alarming, does it? Is that something to be concerned about? My father always said a good doctor explains things clearly, so the patient isn’t left worrying needlessly.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, but not absent. Expected for your age. Now, let's check your range of motion. Can you raise both your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A little stiff, as you can see. It’s the arthritis, I expect. It feels… tighter in the mornings, and after a long day of kneading dough. Not terribly painful, mind you, just… restricted. Is that what you were expecting?
DOCTOR: Yes, as expected. There is some visible swelling and decreased range of motion in your hands. Now, can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A little unsteady, I admit. My balance isn't what it used to be. The floor feels a bit… uneven. I trust this isn't a particularly rigorous examination?
DOCTOR: Walk a few steps for me, please. And try to maintain your balance.
PATIENT: As you can see, Doctor, not particularly graceful. But I get there eventually. My daughter always said I shuffle more than I walk these days. Is something amiss? Are you detecting a problem with my gait? I assure you, I haven’t fallen in years.
DOCTOR: Alright. That will be sufficient. Please sit back down. Based on my examination, and your medical history, you present with… expected age-related changes. Mild arthritis, diminished reflexes, and slightly reduced gait stability. Nothing acutely concerning. We’ll need to review some blood work to rule out any underlying conditions, but I don’t anticipate any major issues.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring, Doctor. Expected age-related changes. I suppose one can’t expect to remain forever young. Though my mother always said a good life helps keep the aches and pains at bay. Blood work, you say? Certainly, if it will provide further peace of mind. I trust you’ll let me know the results as soon as they are available? I am eager to know if I am… suitable, as they say, for the senior living facility.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll order a standard panel. We’ll check your vitamin D levels, thyroid function, and some inflammatory markers. It will take a few days to get the results back. As for your… suitability, based on my initial assessment, I don’t see any medical contraindications to residing in a senior living facility. However, I recommend a consultation with a physical therapist to address your gait stability and strength. I can provide a referral. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A physical therapist, you say? That sounds… sensible. I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to strengthen my legs a bit. Yes, a referral would be most helpful. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have answered all of my questions, and I appreciate your thoroughness – and your patience. I shall await the results of the blood work, and the referral for the physical therapist. Thank you again for your time and attention. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the referral. The physical therapist will contact you to schedule an appointment. And I’ll have the lab results sent to you as soon as they are available. Have a good day, Mr. Tkac. .
