DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… fine, I suppose. Honestly, it’s ridiculous, really. I caught a little cold – just a sniffle, you know? Nothing serious. And now, suddenly, my legs feel like jelly. Like I’ve been running a marathon, and I don’t run. It started yesterday, and it’s not getting any better. It's very inconvenient, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is frustrating when even a little cold seems to knock you off your feet, and especially when it comes with unexpected symptoms like weakness. "Like jelly," you say – can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not painful, exactly. Just… heavy. Like there’s weights attached to them. And wobbly. I feel like I might just… collapse if I stand for too long. It's both legs, and it's pretty much the same in both. I had to practically drag myself out of bed this morning. It’s not something a person my age should be dealing with after a cold, is it? I keep very active, you know, when I'm not… unwell.
DOCTOR: No, it's certainly not typical for a simple cold to cause that level of weakness. It's good you’re describing it so clearly. “Heavy and wobbly” is helpful. And you mentioned it started yesterday – did anything specific happen before it started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Nothing specific, no. I was just… doing my usual things. Giving a tour of the old part of town, mostly. It was a warm day, but nothing excessive. I did have a lot of walking to do, explaining things to those… tourists. Honestly, they ask the silliest questions sometimes. But no, nothing that would explain this. I just started feeling… off, after the tour, and then this morning it was much worse. Really quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it came on gradually after a day of being fairly active, even with walking. And you haven’t experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had colds, obviously, like anyone. But I've never felt this weakness, this… inability to just stand properly. I’m a tour guide, Doctor! I need to be on my feet all day. It’s rather concerning, if you want to know the truth. It's not like I'm some frail old woman. I take care of myself, you know? I eat properly and I'm not one for sitting around. It’s just… baffling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone, especially with your profession relying on physical activity. It is important to figure out what's causing this. To get a better understanding, let’s go through a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness and cold symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, the cold symptoms, of course. Sniffles, a bit of a cough. Nothing major. And… oh, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I attributed that to the cold. And… my hands have felt a bit… tingly, maybe? Not constantly, just off and on. Honestly, I hadn't really paid much attention to it. It's probably nothing. But yes, those are the other things I've noticed. Though I wouldn't say they're significant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some tingling in your hands alongside the cold and weakness. Thank you for mentioning those, even if they seem minor. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any ongoing health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm quite healthy, really. Medicare keeps tabs on things, you know, they run regular checks. And everything is always perfectly… acceptable. My blood pressure is fine, my cholesterol is good. I had a little issue with my back a few years ago, but that was sorted out with physiotherapy. But no ongoing conditions, no. I’m not one for taking pills if I can avoid it. I believe in staying active and keeping things natural, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Ms. Firestone. That’s excellent to hear about the normal check-ups and your proactive approach to health. And no history of back issues currently?
PATIENT: No, the back is fine now. Completely sorted. I did a full course of treatment, and I’ve been careful ever since. It was a long time ago. Really, I'm a very healthy person. This leg weakness is… unexpected, to say the least. It doesn’t fit with my usual picture, you see? I’m usually very robust. It’s just… frustrating and inconvenient, if I'm being perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No current back problems. And thinking about your family... is there any history of neurological conditions—things like stroke, multiple sclerosis, or muscular diseases—in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question. My mother... she had some problems in her later years, but I don’t recall exactly what. Something with her… memory, I think. And my father… he just died of old age, really. Nothing specific. There weren't any… dramatic illnesses, if you understand. My family isn't really one for talking about medical things, if I’m being perfectly honest. They preferred to keep things… private. So, I don't have a lot of information to give you, I'm afraid. It's not something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Firestone. It’s not uncommon for families to not openly discuss medical history. And do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I told you, I prefer to stay natural. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just to be on the safe side, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, and certainly nothing regularly. I find that a good diet and plenty of exercise are far more effective than relying on pills. I’m very careful about what I put into my body, you see? I believe in preventative care, rather than waiting until something goes wrong and then trying to fix it with chemicals. It’s just… common sense, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally. That's helpful to know. One final question about your history, have you ever had any significant surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant. I had my tonsils out as a child, but that was… ages ago. And I was in hospital briefly when I broke my arm playing netball in school, but that was just a simple fracture. Nothing serious. No major surgeries, no prolonged hospital stays. Really, I’ve been very lucky with my health, you see? That’s why this leg weakness is so perplexing. It doesn’t fit with the pattern, you understand? I’m usually very resilient. It’s just… quite unsettling, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child and a simple broken arm. Right. Well, Ms. Firestone, based on what you’ve told me—the sudden weakness in your legs, along with the cold symptoms, fatigue and tingling—I think it’s important to do a bit of a physical examination to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I just want to understand what's going on. Honestly, I need to get back to work. Those tourists don't guide themselves, you know. But I suppose I can spare a few minutes for an examination. Just… try to be quick, if possible? It’s rather inconvenient, this whole situation.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as thorough and efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Sounds clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and muscle strength. I’ll need you to sit on the examination table with your feet dangling. Could you please relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Relaxing… as much as possible. Though honestly, it's a little difficult to relax when I’m thinking about all the things I should be doing. But yes, legs are dangling. Just… let me know if anything feels… unpleasant? I don’t want to exacerbate whatever is going on. It’s already quite bothersome, you see. And I have a tour scheduled for three o’clock. Though I suspect I will have to cancel it at this rate.
DOCTOR: Okay, good reflexes, a little diminished on both sides, but nothing alarming at this stage. Now, I'm going to ask you to try and push your feet against my hands. I’m just checking the strength in your legs. Push as hard as you can, please. Okay, good strength. A little weaker than I would expect, but again, not drastically so. Now, can you lift each leg up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: It's... a little harder than it should be. And there's a slight tremor, you see? Not constant, but it's there. Honestly, it's rather unsettling. I usually have no trouble with this. It feels… strange. Not painful, but definitely not normal. Is this… serious, Doctor? I really need to know. I have commitments, you see. And those tourists… they expect a certain level of service. It’s all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. I appreciate you pointing out the tremor. I'm also feeling some slight resistance when I press on your calf muscles, but no significant swelling or pain. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your legs and feet with this cotton ball. Tell me when you feel it.
PATIENT: Yes… I feel it. Though… it’s a little… muted, perhaps? Not as sharp as it usually is. Especially on the outer sides of my feet. It’s not completely gone, but it’s definitely… diminished. Honestly, it’s all rather unsettling. This is not what I expected. And I really need to know what’s going on. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. People rely on me. It’s all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. Thank you. Based on the examination - the diminished reflexes, slight weakness, the tremor and the muted sensation in your feet – it does seem like there's some nerve involvement. It's too early to say definitively what's causing it, but it could be related to a vitamin deficiency, nerve compression, or, less likely, something more serious. To help me narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and rule out other potential causes. I also think an electromyography and nerve conduction study would be helpful to assess the function of the nerves in your legs. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… fine. Anything that might help. Though honestly, I’m not a fan of needles. But yes, if you think it’s necessary. An… electro-whatsit? That sounds… unpleasant. What exactly does that involve? And how long will all this take? I have commitments, you see. Those tourists… they won’t wait forever. And honestly, this whole situation is just… incredibly inconvenient. Is there any way to expedite things? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. I will expedite things as much as possible. The electromyography and nerve conduction study, or EMG, is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. It involves placing small electrodes on your skin, and then sending a small electrical impulse. It doesn’t hurt, but it can feel a little uncomfortable, like a muscle twitch. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The blood tests will just require a small sample from your arm and should take about 10 minutes. I’ll write you a referral for the EMG and give you a lab slip for the blood tests. The results usually take a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and keeping your legs elevated as much as possible. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m also going to start you on a Vitamin B12 supplement. Sometimes a deficiency can cause these types of symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A Vitamin B12 supplement… fine. If it won't interfere with my schedule. And a little electrical impulse… well, it’s better than nothing, I suppose. Though honestly, I’m not thrilled about it. Thirty to forty-five minutes… I’ll have to cancel my afternoon tour, I presume? And a few days for the results? That's… unacceptable. Very well. I'll cancel the tour. But I expect a quick turnaround. And if it turns out to be something serious, I expect a full explanation. This whole situation is incredibly disruptive. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. And those tourists… they won't be pleased. Give me the referrals and the lab slip. And please, expedite things as much as possible. I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I understand your frustration, and I will do everything I can to expedite the process. I’ll make a note in your chart to prioritize the results. The lab should be able to accommodate you quickly, and I’ll call the EMG facility to see if they have any sooner availability. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased weakness, numbness, or pain – please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: One week… fine. Though I expect to hear from you before then, if anything comes up. And if those results are delayed, I will be contacting your supervisor. This is… highly inconvenient, you see. Very well. A follow-up appointment in one week. I expect a full explanation and a swift resolution to this… predicament. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have tours to cancel. And angry tourists to appease. .
DOCTOR: Understood, Ms. Firestone. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have any updates. And I apologize again for the inconvenience. Please let the front desk know if you need assistance scheduling your tour cancellations. Have a good day, despite the circumstances. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
