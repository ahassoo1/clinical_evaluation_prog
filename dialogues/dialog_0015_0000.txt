DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my legs. They just…gave out on me, practically. It was after a really nasty cold, though. Not that colds mean anything, really. People get colds all the time. But now I can barely walk without feeling like jelly. It’s quite inconvenient, I must say.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. While colds are common, it’s important to understand if this weakness is related, or something else entirely. You said your legs "gave out." Can you describe exactly what that felt like?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t bother writing that down. It’s obvious what it means. But fine, if you insist on details. It was like…the strength just left them. I was walking to get the mail – perfectly normal walking, not rushing or anything – and suddenly they felt…floppy. Like puppets with cut strings. I didn’t fall, exactly, but I had to grab onto the mailbox to keep from stumbling. It happened both legs at the same time, which is rather unsettling, don't you think? Not just one, thankfully. That would be really alarming.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have specifics. "Floppy" is…not a medical term we typically use, but I understand what you mean. Simultaneous weakness is certainly something we need to investigate. And you mentioned this occurred after a cold. Did you have any other symptoms with the cold – fever, cough, body aches, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, a full cold. The works, really. Achy all over, the drippiest nose you’ve ever seen, couldn’t sleep for the coughing… and a fever, of course. A proper one, I had to take something for it. I don’t remember the exact temperature, honestly. I don’t bother with those little thermometers. It was enough to knock me off my feet for a good three days, that’s for sure. And it was before my legs started doing…whatever they’re doing. I don’t get colds often, so I suppose it was a particularly strong one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long ago did this leg weakness start, after you recovered from the cold?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... it was, hmm, about four days, I’d say. I started feeling a little better on Monday, and by Tuesday I thought I was completely over it. Then Wednesday morning, I went to get the mail, and that’s when it happened. So, four days. Perhaps a little less, but close to four. It’s getting worse, though. Yesterday, I could still manage to get around the house, but today… well, I needed a little help getting here, to be honest. Not that I like needing help, you understand. It's undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. And is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely not constant. It comes and goes, mostly. It's worse in the mornings, much worse. Like trying to wade through molasses, honestly. And it gets a little better as the day goes on, but it always comes back. Even if I’m resting. It's… unpredictable, really. Which is the most frustrating part, I think. You can’t plan around it. One minute I’m feeling…well, not good, but manageable, and the next I'm practically glued to the floor. It’s just… aggravating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed, have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or pain in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly. A little achiness, perhaps, but nothing worth mentioning. And certainly no tingling or numbness. They just…feel weak. Like there’s no power in them. It’s very strange. I mean, I’m not a doctor, but it doesn’t feel like a nerve problem. It feels like…the muscles just refuse to work properly. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always prided myself on being very in tune with my body. I think I would know if something was seriously wrong, and this just…feels like a temporary setback after being sick. Though, admittedly, it’s a rather stubborn setback.
DOCTOR: While your self-awareness is commendable, Ms. Firestone, it's important to rule out any underlying causes. I’m going to perform a quick neurological exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It’ll involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose. Though, honestly, I doubt it will show anything. I told you, it feels like a temporary weakness. But, very well. If you must. Just please be gentle. I don't like being poked and prodded. And don't take too long, I have things to do, you know. Though, I suppose if it will get me back on my feet faster… go ahead. But no surprises, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please place your hands, palms up, on the table. I’ll start with your reflexes. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Here. And do hurry, please. It's rather undignifying to have one’s hands squeezed like this. Is that hard enough? I don’t want to strain myself. It’s these legs, you see. They’re not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Now, can you lift each leg, one at a time, against my resistance?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Against…resistance? Well. This is getting rather strenuous, isn’t it? Very well. But be gentle, please. Is that sufficient? It's quite difficult, you know. Honestly, I’m not surprised they’re weak. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. And please, don’t make me hold it for too long. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. I also want you to try standing and walking a few steps, if you’re able. I understand it may be difficult, but it will give me a better idea of your gait and balance. I'll be right here to support you.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That's…less than ideal. I suppose I have no choice. But I warn you, it won’t be pretty. There. Now. Don't rush me. Honestly, it’s a miracle I haven’t fallen yet. It feels like my legs are made of jelly. And please, don’t let go. I’m not as steady as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Thank you. That was helpful. Based on your symptoms, the physical exam, and the fact that this started after a cold, there are a few possibilities. It could be post-viral weakness, which sometimes happens after an infection. However, given the severity and persistence of your weakness, we need to rule out other causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and any signs of inflammation. I also want to get a Creatine Kinase level to check for muscle damage, and a Vitamin B12 level. It is also important to rule out any neurological issues, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for an Electromyography study. Would you be willing to follow up with a neurologist?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That's… a lot. Blood work, I suppose I can manage. I don't like needles, but if it will get to the bottom of this… But a neurologist? An EMG study? What is an EMG study? Sounds rather unpleasant. And frankly, I’m not convinced it’s necessary. I told you, it feels like a temporary weakness. But… if you insist. Very well. But I expect a full explanation, and I want a reputable neurologist. I don't want to be poked and prodded by just anyone. And please, tell me exactly what this study involves. Before I agree to anything further, I want to know what I’m getting myself into. Honestly, all this fuss over a little leg weakness… it’s quite ridiculous. But go ahead. Order your tests. And find me a good neurologist.
DOCTOR: Certainly. An EMG study, or electromyography, involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It helps determine if there's any damage to the nerves or muscles. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it typically doesn't last long. I will provide you with a referral to Dr. Ramirez, who is an excellent neurologist in the area, and his office will explain the procedure in detail. The blood work will help us rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances. I’ll also write a prescription for a multivitamin with B12 in the meantime. We will need to review the results of both the blood work and the EMG study before we can determine the best course of action. If there is no clear cause, we may need to consider other possibilities. In the meantime, I recommend gentle exercise, such as walking, to help maintain your muscle strength. But do not overexert yourself. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That…sounds dreadful. A needle in the muscle? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. Gentle exercise, you say? As if I haven’t been trying to do that already. It’s quite difficult when my legs feel like jelly, you know. I suppose. Very well. But I expect clear explanations from Dr. Ramirez, and I want to know the risks involved with this EMG study. What if it causes further damage? What if it's painful? And what if the results are inconclusive? I don’t want to go through all this fuss for nothing. Honestly, the more I hear about it, the more convinced I am that it’s just a temporary setback. But… very well. Order the tests. Schedule the appointment. And please, send me all the information you have on Dr. Ramirez. I want to be prepared. And… are there any potential side effects from this multivitamin? I don’t want to start feeling worse. Honestly, all this fuss… it’s quite overwhelming. I think I need a cup of tea. And a lie-down. But, yes. That’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood work now, and I’ll send the referral to Dr. Ramirez’s office immediately. They will contact you to schedule the appointment and provide you with all the necessary information about the EMG study, including potential risks and side effects. The multivitamin is generally well-tolerated, but as with any medication, there is a small risk of mild side effects, such as nausea or diarrhea. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please, call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And do remember to rest and avoid overexerting yourself. The nurse will be right in.
