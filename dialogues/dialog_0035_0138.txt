DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's lovely to meet you too. Land sakes, it's been a while since I've been to a doctor… Let me see… Well, my daughter, bless her heart, she's been worried about me. I've been having these… spells, I guess you’d call them. Little weaknesses, mostly on one side. It comes and goes, you know? And my sister… oh, she had terrible headaches her whole life. Real bad migraines. That's what got my daughter concerned, I think. I don't always remember things clearly, so it's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Spells” with weakness on one side… and your daughter is concerned about a family history of headaches. That’s good she’s looking out for you. Let’s try to get a better picture of these spells. When did you first notice them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… that's a tricky one. It wasn't all at once, you know? It’s been… months, maybe? Several months, at least. It started with just feeling a little clumsy, I think. Dropping things a bit more than usual. Then… well, sometimes my arm feels heavy, like I can’t lift it as easily. And I’ve noticed my face feels a little… droopy on one side sometimes. But it doesn't happen all the time. It comes and goes, like a summer breeze. I wish I could pinpoint exactly when it started, but my memory… well, it's not what it used to be. I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual onset over several months with clumsiness, arm weakness, and sometimes facial drooping on one side. And it’s intermittent – comes and goes. Have you noticed anything else happening during these spells?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. During… well, sometimes I get a bit of a… a fuzzy feeling in my head. Not a full headache, not like my sister’s, but just… not quite right. And I slur my words a little, I think. My daughter pointed that out to me. I wasn’t even aware of it at first! It’s hard to tell, you know, when you’re the one talking. But she says I sound a little funny sometimes when it's happening. Other than that… no, not really. Just feeling weak and a bit… off. It doesn't last long, thankfully. Usually just a few minutes, maybe. Then it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fuzzy feeling in your head and some slurred speech, noticed by your daughter, during these episodes. Episodes lasting a few minutes, then resolving. And it's been happening for several months. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, you know, the usual old age stuff. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my blood pressure… the doctor told me it was a little high a few years ago, but I take a pill for it. Just a little orange one, every day. I can't remember the name of it, though. And… oh, I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. I'm a pretty healthy woman, for my age! I try to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands, high blood pressure managed with an orange pill – we can look that up – and gallbladder removal years ago. That's helpful. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see… I do take a vitamin D, the doctor said my levels were a little low. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. Just over the counter, you know. Nothing fancy. And… oh, yes! My daughter gives me a fish oil capsule every day. She says it’s good for my brain. She worries so much! That's all, I think. Just those few things. I really try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D, ibuprofen as needed, and a fish oil capsule. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of! Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I used to help my mother in her garden, and I’m always around flowers and plants. Never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I think I'd know if I was allergic to something by now! No allergies to report, thankfully. Just a sensitive stomach sometimes, if I eat something rich. But that's not an allergy, just… being old!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. You mentioned your sister had headaches. Was anyone else in your family have any medical problems like stroke, heart disease, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, my… now that’s a tough one. My father… he had heart trouble, I think. He was a strong man, but he got sick later in life. Had to go to the hospital a few times. But that was a long time ago, and I was young then. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… well, my daughter says it was dementia. She just forgot things, more and more as she got older. It was very sad. And, oh, yes! My cousin, he had a stroke, I think. Years ago. He never really recovered properly. It’s a bit hazy, you know? It was a long time ago, and there were so many family gatherings… it’s hard to remember exactly who had what. But those are the ones that come to mind. A bit scary, thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heart trouble in your father, dementia in an aunt, and a stroke in a cousin. That’s helpful information. And finally, let’s just quickly go over your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I listened to her. And alcohol… well, I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, back when my husband was alive. But not anymore. It doesn’t agree with me. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if you don't mind! So, no smoking, and very little alcohol. I like to stay sharp, you know? Especially with these little spells… makes me a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and very minimal alcohol. That's good. Thank you for all that information, Ms. Tofani. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological exam to check your strength, balance, and coordination. It won’t take long, and it will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor! Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm a bit of a worrier, you see… but I'll try to be a good patient! Go right ahead. I hope you don't find anything too alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Let’s start with your eyes. Could you follow my finger with your eyes only, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. This isn't a problem, I've had my eyes checked before. Just tell me when to look up, down, left, and right? I hope I don't get dizzy! I do get a bit of a headache sometimes, you see... but I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now, I'm going to check your facial movements. Can you raise your eyebrows, close your eyes tightly, and smile for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Let’s see... There! Is that alright? It feels a little… strange, you know? Like I can't quite control the left side of my face as easily. My daughter said I looked a bit funny when I smile sometimes, and I think she’s right. It feels a bit wobbly. I hope that’s not too worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani. Now, I'm going to check your arm strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. Just let me know when to squeeze. There... is that alright? It feels a bit… difficult. My left arm feels so heavy today. It doesn’t want to cooperate, you see? It’s always been a bit weaker than my right, but it’s worse today, I think. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Now, I'm going to check your leg strength. Could you push your feet against my hands like you’re pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Just tell me when to push. There! Is that alright? It feels… a little harder on this side. My left leg just doesn’t want to cooperate today. It feels heavy and clumsy, you know? It's always been a bit weaker than my right, but it's worse today, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Thank you for your patience. Based on the exam, and what you've told me, you're experiencing weakness on the left side of your body – in your arm and leg. The facial weakness we saw and the reported slurred speech are also concerning. Your symptoms – weakness, facial drooping, possible slurred speech – are suggestive of a possible stroke or transient ischemic attack, also known as a TIA. It’s important to rule that out quickly. I'm concerned about this, and I want to get some imaging done right away to understand what's going on. We need to do a CT scan of your brain and possibly an MRI to look for any evidence of a stroke. We’ll also need to do some blood work to check your overall health. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A stroke? Land sakes, that sounds… frightening. My cousin… he had a stroke, you said? Is that what you think is happening to me? Imaging? Blood work? It all sounds so… serious. I just… I don’t feel well, but I didn’t think it was that serious. Is it going to be painful? Will I have to stay in the hospital? I just want to go home and have a cup of tea… but if you think I need these tests… then I suppose I need them. Just… please tell me what's going to happen. And will it be alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Tofani. It is frightening to hear that word, stroke. And you're right to be concerned. However, it's important to remember that we haven’t confirmed anything yet. These are just my initial concerns, based on your symptoms and the exam. We need to do these tests – the CT scan and blood work – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The CT scan is painless. You’ll lie on a table and a machine will take pictures of your brain. It’s quick and doesn’t involve any needles or anything like that. The blood work will involve a small needle prick to draw some blood. If it is a stroke or a TIA, early treatment is crucial. The sooner we can diagnose it and start treatment, the better the chance of a good recovery. We may need to admit you to the hospital for monitoring and treatment. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to get those tests done first. I’m going to order those tests right away. A nurse will come in shortly to take your blood pressure and get you prepped for the CT scan. I'll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, which is sometimes used in CT scans?
PATIENT: Oh, contrast dye? I… I don't think so. I’ve had a few tests over the years, but I don’t remember anything about dye. My daughter usually handles all of that, you see, and I just… let her take care of it. I haven’t had any reactions to anything before, though. Just… a bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes. Does that count? And… what kind of treatment would I need if it is a stroke? Will it be painful? And… will I be able to go home eventually? I have my cats to look after, you see. They’ll be worried sick if I’m gone for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergy to contrast dye is good. We’ll proceed cautiously regardless. And it’s perfectly fine that your daughter usually handles these things. If it is a stroke, the treatment depends on the type of stroke. Sometimes, it involves medication to dissolve the blood clot and restore blood flow. Other times, it may require a procedure to remove the clot. The goal is to minimize damage to the brain and prevent further complications. Pain is possible, but we’ll do everything we can to manage it with medication. It’s not usually severe, and we have a lot of options to keep you comfortable. And yes, the goal is always to get you home as soon as it’s safe. Most people recover from strokes with rehabilitation, and we’ll work with you to develop a plan to get you back to your normal life. You'll definitely be able to go back to your cats! I’m going to call the nurse now to start the process. She’ll explain everything in more detail, and you can ask her any questions you have. I’ll be back as soon as I have more information. Try to stay calm, Ms. Tofani. We're going to take good care of you.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Thank you. I… I will try to stay calm. Just… please don’t keep me waiting too long. I don’t like being alone with my thoughts right now. And… could you please let my daughter know what’s happening? She’ll be worried sick. Her name is… Isabella. Isabella Rossi. And… thank you again. For everything. I’m just… scared.
