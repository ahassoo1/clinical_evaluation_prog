DOCTOR: Good morning, Philipp. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels... funny sometimes. Like it's beating too fast, but not regular. It's been happening for a little bit now. Maybe a week? It doesn't hurt, just... weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of noticing a fast and irregular heartbeat. That's good information to start with. Can you describe what you mean by "weird"?
PATIENT: Hmm... like, sometimes it feels like it skips a beat, you know? And then it goes really fast for a few seconds. Then it goes back to normal. It's hard to explain. Like a fluttering, maybe? It happens when I'm just sitting, or sometimes when I walk. Not when I'm sleeping, though. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, skipping beats and a fluttering sensation, happening both at rest and with activity. Not noticeable during sleep. That’s helpful. Do you notice anything before it happens?
PATIENT: Before? Let me think... No, not really. Sometimes I feel a little... worried about things, but that's normal, right? I don't think it's because of being worried, but I worry a lot. Not like sick worry, just... things. It just happens. It doesn't seem to be connected, but maybe it is. I don't know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is, it is. Anxiety can certainly play a role in these kinds of sensations. But we need to rule out any other potential causes first. Now, have you ever had this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I've felt tired sometimes, and maybe my heart beat fast when I exercise, but not this... skipping and fluttering. This is new. A week ago, it didn't happen. Before that, nothing. My wife, she noticed it too, when I was sitting with her last night. She said my face looked a little different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new symptom for you, starting about a week ago, and your wife has noticed a change in your appearance when it happens. That's good information. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little cough sometimes, especially in the winter, but nothing serious. I haven't been to the doctor in... a long time. Maybe five years? I work with chemicals, so I try to be careful. I don't think it's from the work, though. We have safety rules. I am healthy, I think. Just this heart thing now. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, haven't been to the doctor in five years, work with chemicals but follow safety protocols. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgery or been in the hospital for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgery, no hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that was in Yemen, a long time ago. They put a cast on it and that was it. Nothing else. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I haven’t needed a hospital or anything like that. Mostly just this heart… feeling. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re taking it seriously, and that your wife is noticing too. Let's talk about your family. Do you know of any heart problems or sudden deaths in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had a weak heart, I think. He was old, though. He died when I was little. I don’t remember much. No one else, not really. My father was healthy, and my brothers and sisters are all okay. No one talks about heart trouble in my family, if that makes sense? It’s not something we… discuss. It’s not a big topic. Sorry if that’s not helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Philipp. Knowing there was a grandfather with a weak heart is good to know, even if details are limited. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. And I don't drink alcohol, not even a little bit. It's not allowed in my religion, really. And no drugs, never. I work with chemicals at work, but I don't take anything else. I just drink water and tea, mostly. And coffee in the morning, to wake up. But nothing else. I promise.
DOCTOR: Good, good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not to food, not to medicine, nothing. My wife always checks, because I forget things sometimes, but she says I'm good. I can eat anything, take anything, I think. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything ever. She worries a lot, my wife. But she's a good woman. Are we done now, Doctor? I hope we can figure out this heart thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, we've covered a lot. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. Please, check everything. I just want to feel normal again. It worries my wife when I feel like this. She’s a good woman, she worries a lot. Let's listen to the heart, then. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on your back, please. Okay. Your blood pressure is 128 over 82, which is normal. Your pulse rate is currently 78 and regular, but I did hear a few irregular beats while listening. It wasn't consistent, though. Your lungs sound clear. Do you feel anything when I press here?
PATIENT: No, nothing. It doesn't hurt or anything. Just feels like... you're listening. It's okay. I don't feel anything wrong. It's just strange, this feeling in my heart. But when you listen, I don't feel anything here. It's just... there. It feels like a fluttering, sometimes. But when you press, nothing. Is that bad, Doctor? Is it something serious? My wife is very worried.
DOCTOR: No pain with palpation is good. The irregular beats I heard were infrequent, which is reassuring, but we still need to investigate further. It’s possible it’s a benign arrhythmia, meaning it’s not dangerous, but we can’t say for sure without some additional testing. I'd like to order an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to get a better picture of your heart’s electrical activity. It's a quick, painless test. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: An EKG? What is that? Is it… painful? My wife, she doesn't like needles. Will it take long? I have to go back to work this afternoon, you see. But if it helps, I will do it. I just… I don’t like things that hurt. And my wife worries, she really does. But if it's quick and helps find out what’s wrong with my heart, then yes. I’ll do it. Tell me about it, please. Is it like a needle?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not like a needle at all. It’s completely painless. We simply attach small, sticky pads – electrodes – to your chest, arms, and legs. These pads detect the electrical signals from your heart, and the machine records them on a graph. It doesn’t involve any injections or discomfort whatsoever. It takes about five to ten minutes. We can do it right here in the clinic. Then, I'll review the results and we can discuss the next steps. It will give us a much clearer idea of what's going on with your heart. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, sticky pads. Not a needle. That's good. Five minutes. That's okay, I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear it's not painful. Sticky pads, five minutes. Then you look at the paper? And tell me what it means? That sounds… good. Yes, let's do it. I want to know what's wrong with my heart. And my wife wants to know too. She's very worried, you see. Okay, sticky pads it is. Where do we put them?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for me, and I'll explain as I go. We'll need to expose your chest, just so the pads have good contact with your skin. I'll give you a gown to change into. Then I'll clean the areas where the pads will go. I'm just placing these here, on your chest, arms, and legs. They might feel a little cool. This one goes here, and this one goes here. Don’t worry, it won’t hurt. Okay, all set. Now, I’m going to start the machine. Just relax and breathe normally. Alright, that's all done. The machine has recorded the electrical activity of your heart. It will take me a few minutes to review the results. If you could just wait here for a moment, I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay. Sticky pads. Relax and breathe. I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear it's all done. I'll just sit here and wait. Thank you, Doctor. It’s good you are looking at the paper. I hope it tells us something. I just want to feel normal again. Let me know what you find out. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp. I've reviewed the EKG results. It shows some evidence of premature atrial contractions, or PACs. These are extra beats that originate in the upper chambers of your heart. They're very common, and often harmless, especially if you're not experiencing any other symptoms. However, they can sometimes cause a sensation of palpitations or fluttering, which sounds like what you’ve been describing. The good news is, there's no sign of any structural heart disease or serious arrhythmias. The EKG doesn't indicate anything immediately life-threatening. But, to be on the safe side, and to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your thyroid levels and electrolytes. Sometimes imbalances in these areas can contribute to PACs. And I recommend you also wear a Holter monitor for 24 hours. It’s a small, portable device that records your heart’s activity continuously over a full day. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: PACs… extra beats. Not dangerous? That’s good. I’m glad it’s not something serious. Blood test and… a Holter monitor? What is that? Another sticky pad machine? For a whole day? My wife… she won’t like that, she worries so much. But if it helps… if it tells us what’s wrong, then yes. I’ll wear the sticky pad machine for a whole day. And the blood test. Whatever you need, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. So, blood test and a sticky pad machine for a whole day. What do I do with the sticky pad machine? Do I still have to work?
DOCTOR: Yes, a Holter monitor. It’s a small, portable device, about the size of a small pager, that we attach to your chest with wires and electrodes – yes, a few sticky pads. It records your heart rhythm continuously for 24 hours while you go about your normal daily activities. You can still work, sleep, exercise – whatever you normally do. It’s important to keep a log of your activities and any symptoms you experience while wearing it, so we can correlate them with the heart rhythm recording. The blood test is just a simple draw from your arm. We’ll check your thyroid and electrolytes. I’ll give you a requisition form for both tests. You can go to any lab, and it should only take a few minutes. Then, I'll review the results of both tests, and we can discuss the next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, sticky pad machine for a whole day. Keep a log. Blood test. Normal daily activities. That sounds… okay. A lot of things, but okay. I’ll keep the log. And I’ll go to the lab for the blood test. My wife… I’ll tell her about the sticky pad machine for a whole day. She won’t like it, but she’ll understand. She wants me to be healthy. So, blood test, sticky pad machine, and keep a log. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything else? I think that's everything. I hope we can find out what's wrong with my heart soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Philipp. I understand it's a lot, but it's the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. I’ll give you a prescription for a mild beta-blocker to take as needed for palpitations, while we wait for the test results. It won't cure anything, but it may help alleviate your symptoms. And, just to reiterate, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the test results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Chest pain, shortness of breath… okay. I’ll remember that. Beta-blocker… for the palpitations. That sounds good. I hope it helps. Two weeks… to talk about the results. I think that’s everything. No, I don’t think I have any more questions. Thank you very much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. My wife will be happy to hear we have a plan. I’ll go to the lab and get the blood test. And I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Philipp. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day to you too.
