DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hello. Dr. Bombara, right? Look, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what brings me in. My… well, my late wife booked this appointment, God rest her soul. Something about… sleep and getting back in shape? She was always fussing over that sort of thing. I just sort of… followed the paperwork. Don’t really have much energy for remembering details these days, you see. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure. Losing someone is… incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for things to feel unclear afterwards. We can certainly try to figure out what your wife was concerned about. So, just starting broadly, would you say you've been having any trouble with your sleep lately?
PATIENT: Trouble with sleep… hmm. I sleep… I do sleep. Most nights, anyway. It’s not like I’m tossing and turning all night. But… I don't necessarily feel rested when I wake up. More… like I haven't really been anywhere, you know? Like I just… existed in the dark for a few hours. Is that… a problem? Honestly, I wouldn’t know what good sleep feels like anymore. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good way to describe it, Chanz. Feeling unrefreshed even after sleeping is definitely something we should explore. It’s important to understand why you aren’t feeling rested, even if the quantity of sleep seems adequate. And how about during the day?
PATIENT: During the day… It’s… slow. Everything’s just… slow. I run a little repair shop, you see. Musical instruments. Keeps me busy enough, fiddling with strings and wood. But even that… takes more effort than it used to. I used to be able to work all day without a problem. Now I need… breaks. Lots of them. And I’m always tired, even with the breaks. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous, though. Just… delicate work. Is that what you mean? Are you asking if I’m… active? Because I'm not running marathons or anything.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Chanz. I just wanted to get a sense of your daily activity level. It sounds like you’re still engaged in work you enjoy, which is good. But a significant change in energy levels, even with relatively low-exertion activities, is worth investigating. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… That’s… a sensitive subject, to be honest. My wife, God rest her soul, was always on about my weight. I’ve… probably put on a few pounds since she passed. Not a lot, but… noticeable. I eat when I'm bored, I suppose. And there's been a lot of boredom lately. I try to… maintain. But it's difficult. It's not like I’m actively trying to gain weight, if that makes sense. Just… not actively losing it either. I haven’t stepped on a scale in months, to be truthful. Don’t really have the… inclination. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It can matter, Chanz, but it’s not the most important thing right now. Weight can sometimes contribute to fatigue and sleep disturbances, but more importantly, it’s part of the overall picture. We're just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, dear. That’s… difficult. I went to the doctor when my wife told me to, of course. Check-ups and things. Nothing major, as far as I recall. High blood pressure, maybe? They put me on some pills for it. I think. I take pills every morning, so… something must be wrong, I suppose. Honestly, I just let my wife handle all that. She kept all the records. I wouldn’t even know where to begin. Medicare covers everything, so I just… showed up when they told me to. Do you need a list of medications? I could try to find it, but it’ll probably take hours.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Chanz. Don't worry about finding a list right now. We can access your medication history through Medicare. It might take me a moment to pull it up. While I'm doing that, can you tell me if you’ve ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia repaired when I was in my twenties. But that was… a long time ago too. Aside from that, no. Nothing major, anyway. Mostly just… scrapes and bruises from being clumsy. My wife always said I wasn't very coordinated. It feels like a lifetime ago, all of it. So much has happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and hernia repair. Thank you. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My wife… she had a sister. Lives up in the city. We didn't see her much. And… I had a brother, but he passed away a few years back. Heart trouble. Not a very healthy family, to be honest. Both my parents… they're gone. Long gone. I'm… pretty much on my own, really. No close family to speak of. It's… lonely, sometimes. But what can you do? Life goes on, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of, no. I eat pretty much everything. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. She used to worry about me trying exotic foods when we traveled. Never had a reaction to anything, though. Never been stung by a bee or anything either. No rashes, no swelling, no trouble breathing. I just… haven’t noticed any allergies, if that makes sense. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Don’t ask much of life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Oh. Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I haven't had one in… goodness knows how long. My wife used to insist on them, but… I didn’t really pay much attention. Just told me everything was “fine.” Fine, fine, everything was always fine. Just do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose it can’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It will only take a few minutes. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a bit elevated: 145/90. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are normal, and neurological function appears intact. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. No masses or organomegaly noted. Okay, Chanz. Everything seems relatively normal, but we’ll need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D levels. I also want to order a chest X-ray just to rule out any underlying lung issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A bit tender, you say? Hmm. That's… not surprising. I've had a bit of indigestion lately. Probably just something I ate. I tend to overeat when I'm stressed, I suppose. Blood tests and an X-ray… Goodness. That sounds like… a lot. But alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I just want to feel… better. I just want to have some energy again. I used to be so active, you know? Now I just… exist. So yes, do what you need to do. Just let me know when I can go home. I've got a shop to run.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lab is right down the hall, and the X-ray technician is very efficient. I’ll have the results sent to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I’ve reviewed them. In the meantime, let's discuss some lifestyle modifications that might help alleviate some of your symptoms. Have you been getting any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Regular exercise? Oh, Doctor. You’re killing me. The most exercise I get these days is walking from the shop to the cafe for lunch. And back, of course. It’s not a marathon, but it keeps me moving, I suppose. But honestly, I haven't had the motivation to do much more than that. I used to go hiking with my wife, but… well, that was a long time ago. It’s difficult to find the energy, you know? And even more difficult to find the… desire. It's just easier to sit. Easier to exist. What kind of exercise were you thinking of? Something I can do sitting down?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chanz. It's perfectly alright to start small. We don't need to aim for marathons right away. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. The goal is to gradually increase your activity level as your energy improves. Now, let's talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: My diet… Oh, dear. That's not a pretty picture, Doctor. To be honest, it's mostly… convenience food. I'm not much of a cook, you see. My wife did all the cooking. And now… I just grab whatever's easy. Sandwiches, pastries, coffee… Sometimes I'll heat up a frozen dinner, but that's about it. I don't really pay attention to what I'm eating, to be honest. Just whatever fills me up. I have a sweet tooth, too. Can't resist a good pastry. And coffee… I need coffee to get through the day. It's a habit, I suppose. A bad habit. It's not a healthy diet, I know. But what can you do? It's easier to just eat. Easier to just exist.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. It’s not uncommon for dietary habits to change after a loss. It takes energy to prepare healthy meals, and when energy is low, it's easy to fall into convenience foods. Let's not focus on strict restrictions right now. Perhaps we can start with small changes. Would you be willing to try swapping one sugary drink or pastry a day for a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts?
PATIENT: A piece of fruit… or a handful of nuts? Hmm. That doesn't sound too terrible. I suppose I could try that. I do like apples, actually. And walnuts. Yes, I think I could manage that. Just one pastry a day instead of… however many I'm eating now. It’s not a major change. It shouldn't be too difficult. It's just… everything feels like an effort these days. But alright, Doctor. I'll try it. One less pastry. For my health. And for you. Don't expect miracles, though. It's a habit, you know? A bad habit.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful start, Chanz. And I don’t expect miracles. Small, sustainable changes are much more effective than drastic overhauls. It’s about progress, not perfection. Now, before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I suppose… I've been sleeping… differently. Not nightmares, exactly. Just… restless. I wake up several times during the night. And I'm not really tired when I wake up. More… frustrated. Like I haven't really slept at all. It’s probably just stress, though. It’s difficult to relax, you know? There’s always something on my mind. The shop, the bills, the… emptiness. I suppose it’s normal. But it's… unsettling. I’ve tried chamomile tea. Didn’t really help. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything you recommend?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Chanz. Restless sleep is often a sign of underlying stress or anxiety. Chamomile tea is a good first step, but sometimes it’s not enough. Before we consider medication for sleep, which we can discuss if things don't improve, I'd recommend a few relaxation techniques. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises or meditation?
PATIENT: Deep breathing exercises? Meditation? Oh, Doctor. You’re really testing me now. No, I haven't tried any of that. I’m not really the… zen type, you know? I’m a practical man. I fix things. I don’t… sit and breathe. It sounds a bit… silly, to be honest. But alright. I suppose I could try it. If you think it might help. But don’t expect miracles. It’s not really my thing. Is there an app or something? Something that can guide me? I wouldn’t even know where to begin.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Chanz. Many people find deep breathing and meditation very helpful. And there are excellent apps that can guide you through the process. I recommend “Calm” or “Headspace.” They offer guided meditations for beginners, and they can teach you simple relaxation techniques. Here are the names. You can download them on your phone. Start with just a few minutes each day. Even five minutes can make a difference. Okay, Chanz. We’ve covered a lot today. To recap, we’re going to run some blood tests and an X-ray. I’ve given you the names of a few apps for relaxation. I’ve asked you to try swapping one sugary snack a day for a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts, and to try the relaxation techniques. We'll follow up to discuss the test results, and see how you're feeling. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: "Calm" and "Headspace," huh? Alright. I'll give them a try. No promises, though. I'm not really the… tech-savvy type either. Blood tests, X-ray, relaxation apps, healthier snacks… It's a lot. But alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel… better. I just want to have some energy again. Yes, that sounds good. I'll see you when the test results are back. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I hope you have a good day. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. Remember, small steps can make a big difference. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you have a good day as well. It was a pleasure meeting you. We’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor. Thank you again for everything.
