DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today with… well, I confess my notes are a little sparse this morning. Could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pirl, is it? Hmm… what brings me in? Let me see… it has something to do with a test. A check, maybe? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something about making sure I’m… alright. Medicare sent something, I think. A letter. Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that… that’s starting to come back to me. Medicare does send quite a lot of reminders. It appears you received a notification regarding your annual wellness exam. Is that what you’re referring to, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Annual… wellness? Maybe. It sounds right, but I still don't really remember being told about it. It's probably just a routine thing, though, right? They send those out to everyone, don't they? And it involves a… a check of some kind? Not a big one, I hope. I'm not good with needles.
DOCTOR: Indeed, it is quite routine, Ms. Hughston. And you are correct, Medicare does encourage everyone to have an annual wellness visit. It's a fairly comprehensive check-up, but we can certainly tailor it to your comfort level. As part of the exam, we typically check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, weight – and review your medical history. We also discuss any concerns you might have. As for needles… we can discuss what's absolutely necessary, and avoid them if possible. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Oh, well… current health. I mostly just… keep going. You know? I still do my work, paving and such. Keeps me busy. It's hard on the back sometimes, but what can you do? I’m a widow, so I don’t have anyone at home relying on me to… well, to be at peak condition, if you catch my drift. I eat when I’m hungry, sleep when I’m tired. Not much excitement, really. Is there anything specific you’re wanting to know? I’m terrible with remembering doctors' questions.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. We’ll take it slowly. It sounds as though you remain quite active, which is excellent. Let’s start with a review of your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems – that have been diagnosed previously?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Chronic… conditions. That sounds serious. Let me think… My husband, bless his soul, he had something with his heart, I think. But me? I… I honestly don’t recall a doctor ever telling me I had anything chronic. I’ve had aches and pains, of course. Comes with the job. And a bad knee now and then. But nothing… official. Does that make sense? I’m really not good at this.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. Don't worry about it at all. We’ll get through this. Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries. Now that’s a good question. Let me see… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That's about all I can remember. Nothing since then, thankfully. No hospital stays, either. A few trips to the emergency room for bumps and bruises from work, but nothing serious enough to… stay overnight, if you know what I mean. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Hughston, thank you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… well, that’s a bit of a tricky one. I try to avoid them if I can. My husband’s doctor had him on so many pills, it was awful. I just… I don’t really take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen for my back when it’s really bothering me. And a little something for sleep sometimes, when I can't quiet my mind. But that's it, really. Nothing prescribed, if that makes a difference. Does that sound alright? I feel like I should be remembering something more important… but I just can’t.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s good you’re mindful of what you're taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… You know, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I can recall, anyway. I eat pretty much everything. My husband was allergic to shellfish, but that’s not something I share. I haven’t had any hives or trouble breathing, or anything like that. Is that… good? It feels like I should be able to list something, but my mind is just… blank. I hope that’s not a problem.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Ms. Hughston. It's perfectly fine not to have any known allergies. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tough one. My parents are both gone now, and I didn't keep up with a lot of their medical things. My mother… she had something with her blood pressure, I think. And my father… he worked in the shipyard, hard labor. He had bad joints when he got older, but I don’t know if that was a family thing or just… the work. My brother… he’s still alive, but we haven’t spoken in years. I honestly couldn’t tell you what’s going on with him. Is that helpful? It’s all a bit… fuzzy. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s common to not have a complete picture of family history. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I used to… when my husband was still around, we’d have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But I haven’t touched a drop since he passed. And no, I definitely don’t smoke. Never have. As for… recreational drugs… Oh, no. Absolutely not. I'm a working woman, Doctor. I need a clear head for my job. Not a chance. Is that what this test is about?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hughston, it's not specifically about that. It's just standard information we gather as part of your overall health assessment. Alright. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, is there anything you are particularly concerned about today?
PATIENT: Hmm… concerned about? You know, I've been feeling… a little tired lately. More tired than usual, even for me. And my back… it's been acting up. But that's just part of the job, I suppose. Honestly, I just want to make sure I'm still fit enough to keep working. That's all. I don't want to slow down. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Hughston. That’s a very valid concern. Alright. Let’s start with a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll take a look at your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle with my back, if you don't mind. It's a bit sensitive. And please, don't rush. I get nervous when people rush. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. We'll take our time. Just relax your arm for me… excellent. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally, normal breath sounds. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, could you please lie down on the examination table so I can take a look at your back?
PATIENT: Oh, my back… it's a bit stiff this morning. There you go. Be careful, Doctor. It’s right… about here. And if I flinch, it's not personal. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Just let me know if anything feels particularly sore. Hmm… there is some tenderness in the lumbar region, particularly on the left side. No obvious signs of injury. Muscle spasms are present, but not severe. Range of motion is slightly limited. Do you feel any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit tender, yes. Right there. And no, no pain radiating down my legs. Just… a dull ache in my back. It comes and goes, mostly when I've been working hard. It’s not constant, thankfully. But it’s enough to bother me. Do you think it's serious?
DOCTOR: It doesn't appear to be anything acutely serious, Ms. Hughston. It seems as though you're experiencing a muscle strain or sprain, likely related to your work. The limited range of motion and muscle spasms are consistent with that. However, to rule out anything more serious, such as a herniated disc, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. I don't particularly like X-rays. I had one years ago, and it wasn't pleasant. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I just… I don’t want to be exposed to too much radiation, you know? Is it really that important? Could we try something else first? Like… a heating pad, maybe? Or some exercises?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hughston. You're right to be mindful of radiation exposure. The amount of radiation from a single X-ray is very small, but I always take your concerns seriously. We could certainly try conservative treatment first – heat, ice, and gentle exercises – and see if that provides relief. However, given the limited range of motion and the tenderness you’re experiencing, I believe an X-ray would be prudent to rule out any structural issues. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help guide our treatment plan. If the X-ray shows no abnormalities, we can proceed with conservative management. If it does reveal something, we’ll discuss the findings and explore appropriate options. What do you say?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you really think it’s best… then yes, let’s do the X-ray. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. And I hope it doesn’t hurt. When can we get it done? And what do I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the order sent to the radiology department right away. They’re usually very efficient, and the procedure itself is quite quick – just a few minutes. It shouldn’t cause any discomfort, Ms. Hughston – just a brief exposure to radiation. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare. Just wear comfortable clothing – nothing with metal zippers or buttons in the area of your lower back. And please, let me know if you're feeling claustrophobic or anxious at any point during the procedure. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available – usually within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease your discomfort and an anti-inflammatory to reduce any swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… and anti-inflammatory… yes, that sounds good. Anything to help with the pain. Will those make me sleepy? I need to be able to work, you know. I can’t afford to take too much time off. And what about the results? How will I know when they’re in? Will someone call me? I don’t want to have to keep calling the office.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Hughston. The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, so I’ll prescribe a low dose to minimize that effect. We can adjust it if needed. And the anti-inflammatory should have minimal side effects. As for the results, the radiology department will automatically send them to me. As soon as I have them, my staff will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. You won’t need to call the office – we’ll reach out to you. Now, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's just… getting older isn't easy, you know? Thank you. I think that’s all for now. I guess I’ll go wait for the phone call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. And you’re right – getting older isn’t always easy, but we’ll do our best to keep you comfortable and active. My staff will be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. Take care, Ms. Hughston. And try to get some rest. We’ll get this sorted out.
