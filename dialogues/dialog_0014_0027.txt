DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Altine, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Look, I got things to do today, so if we could just get right to it, that'd be great. It's this heartburn, see? Been happening for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “A while now” is…vague. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, I don't know exactly. Months, probably. Look, I don't spend my time cataloging when my stomach acts up. I'm an Emergency Management Director, I deal with real problems, not…this. It's just…uncomfortable. And it's getting worse, that's what matters.
DOCTOR: Right. Emergency Management. Busy. Okay, getting worse…in what way?
PATIENT: Well, it used to just be after big meals, you know? Now it's...happening at night, keeps me up. And it's not just a little burn, it's like…food coming back up. Not a full-on throw-up, just…regurgitation. Disgusting, really. I haven't got time for this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, nighttime symptoms, regurgitation… not vomiting, regurgitation. And it’s interfering with sleep. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. It's more…a pressure, a burning sensation, like something's…irritated. It’s in my chest, mostly. And, frankly, it's embarrassing. I don't need to be explaining my digestive issues to anyone. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest discomfort. Regurgitation. We need to rule out a few things, Mr. Altine. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No, I haven’t had any trouble swallowing. I eat just fine, thank you very much. Look, I’m a big man, I don’t have trouble with…food going down. This isn’t some delicate condition, it’s just…acid reflux, right? Can we just get something for that? I'm not looking for a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: Acid reflux is possible, yes. But "just" acid reflux can sometimes mimic other, more serious things. Do you experience any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Not really. Maybe a little queasy after the…episode, but not sick, you know? I’m not the type to get sick. It's just…unpleasant. Look, I eat a sensible diet, mostly. Steak, potatoes, sometimes a good kielbasa. I don't go around eating spicy food or anything foolish. This is probably just stress, to be honest. I deal with emergencies all day! It probably upsets my stomach.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute, but we still need a little more information. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good Lord, no. Absolutely not. I wouldn't touch a cigarette. Ruined my father’s health, thank you very much. And I've got a good set of lungs, need 'em for…well, never you mind. Just get me something to stop this heartburn, alright? It's really all I'm asking for. I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. It won’t take long. Then we can discuss some options. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. I rarely take anything, honestly. A pain reliever for a bad back sometimes, but that's it. I'm a sturdy Polish man, I don't need a lot of pills. Just…let's get this over with, alright? I've got a meeting this afternoon. And please, try not to poke too much. I'm not exactly delicate.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. Abdomen is…soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Height and weight…a bit underweight for your stature. Do you have any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Underweight? What are you talking about? I'm a big man! Always have been. Maybe I lost a few pounds, I’ve been stressed, alright? It’s not like I’m wasting away! And frankly, I don’t appreciate you commenting on my weight. It’s none of your business. Just give me something for this heartburn, and I’ll be on my way. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s skip the weight discussion. Based on your symptoms—heartburn, regurgitation, no nausea, no difficulty swallowing—it could be GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, given the nighttime symptoms and the fact that it’s worsening, and the recent unintentional weight loss, I want to be cautious. I'm going to recommend a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, like omeprazole, twice daily for two weeks. But I also want you to get an upper endoscopy. It's a simple procedure where they look at your esophagus and stomach to rule out anything serious. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a gastroenterologist. Would you like me to schedule that for you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Absolutely not. Look, I’m not sticking any tubes down my throat! This is ridiculous. Omeprazole, fine, I’ll try that. But no endoscopies. I'm not wasting my time and money on unnecessary procedures. I’m a perfectly healthy man, just a bit of heartburn. Write the prescription, and I’ll be going. And don’t bother with the referral. I’m done. .
DOCTOR: Fine. I've written you a prescription for omeprazole, 20mg twice daily for two weeks. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, you need to see Dr. Ramirez. I strongly advise it. And…please, be aware of any difficulty swallowing, any bleeding, or unexplained weight loss. I'm documenting your refusal of the endoscopy. Is there anything else?
