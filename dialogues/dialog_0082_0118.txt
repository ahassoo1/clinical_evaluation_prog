DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. I believe it’s… a certification of some sort? For my work. Honestly, the paperwork these days is just dreadful. I was told I needed this exam. Something about needing to prove I can still… function, I suppose. It's all a bit blurry, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A certification for work… alright. It sounds like a routine physical, then, with a focus on ensuring you’re fit for your duties. “Functioning,” as you put it. No problem at all. We can certainly do that. Before we get started, let me just ask a few questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. It’s been… some time since I’ve seen you, hasn’t it?
PATIENT: “Some time” is putting it mildly, Doctor. I daresay I haven’t been to a physician in… well, quite a long while. Honestly, I’ve always found them rather… unnecessary. But regulations are regulations, I suppose. Ask away, though I can't promise my memory is what it once was. Do you really need to know everything?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Oriley. We don’t need to delve into everything. Just the basics to get a good picture. And don’t worry, if you can’t recall something, we’ll simply move on. Let's start with your current health. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? At my age? Doctor, where doesn’t something ache? But I suppose you mean anything… significant. Hmm. My lower back has been a bit troublesome lately. Nothing debilitating, just a dull ache. Probably just from… existing, really. And my knees creak something awful when I stand up. It’s perfectly normal, I assure you. A sign of a life well-lived.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back and knees. Dull ache, you said, and creaking. How long have you been noticing this discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. The knees, for as long as I can remember, truthfully. The back… perhaps the last year or so? It comes and goes, really. I wouldn’t say it’s a constant companion. It flares up after I’ve been… well, after I’ve been active. Though, “active” is a rather generous term these days. Mostly gardening, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Gardening, alright. And does anything relieve the back pain when it flares up?
PATIENT: Relieve it? A comfortable chair, mostly. And perhaps a bit of… inaction. Honestly, Doctor, I find that ignoring it is the most effective remedy. Why bother fussing over a little discomfort? It’s a waste of good energy. Though, my daughter insists I take some… pills. I’ve tried them a few times. Didn’t seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: I see. You've tried some medication without much success. And your daughter is concerned, which is good. Let's move on to other symptoms, then. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Doctor, are you suggesting I’m ill? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy, all things considered. I haven’t had a fever in decades. Night sweats… well, I live in a rather warm climate. A bit of perspiration is to be expected. No, I haven’t been feeling unwell in the slightest. Just… aging. There’s a difference, you know. A rather significant difference.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. I apologize if I caused any offense, Mr. Oriley. Simply routine questions, as I mentioned. Just trying to get a complete picture. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? Hmm. I suppose I haven’t been as… enthusiastic about eating lately. Not that I’ve lost my appetite entirely, just… less of an urge. As for weight, I haven’t stepped on a scale in… goodness knows how long. It’s a rather vulgar exercise, if you ask me. Numbers don’t define a man, Doctor. But if you must know, I likely haven’t gained any. Though I may have lost a pound or two. It's difficult to say, truthfully. I simply eat when I’m hungry and stop when I’m not. A perfectly sensible approach, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: A sensible approach indeed. Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… goodness. That’s… a bit of a challenge. I had something, years ago. My first wife was quite insistent I see a doctor about it. Something about… cholesterol, I believe. They put me on a rather unpleasant medication for a while. I stopped taking it eventually. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and it upset my stomach terribly. As for diabetes or heart disease… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been a rather… robust individual. Though, my memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps there was something else. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. I do recall a rather nasty bout of… the flu, many years ago. But that’s hardly a chronic condition, is it?
DOCTOR: No, the flu wouldn’t be considered chronic. And it’s perfectly alright that you don't recall everything. We’ll do our best to piece things together. You mentioned cholesterol, and being taken off medication. Do you know why you were taken off of it?
PATIENT: Oh, that doctor. A young fellow, terribly eager to prescribe pills for everything. He said something about… side effects, I believe. Upset stomach, as I mentioned. And he said my numbers weren't that high. Honestly, I think he just wanted to get me out of his office. A perfectly competent physician, I'm sure, but a bit too eager for my liking. I simply told him I'd manage it on my own. A bit of exercise, a healthy diet… perfectly sensible, really. And I haven’t had any problems since. That was… oh goodness, must have been fifteen years ago? Perhaps longer. Time flies, you know. Especially when you’re not paying attention to it.
DOCTOR: Yes, time does fly. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Yes, I believe so. A rather minor procedure, actually. Appendicitis, many years ago. When I was quite young, still in the military. I recall being rather unwell for a few days, then they whisked me off to the hospital and… well, that was that. Nothing serious, thankfully. A quick in-and-out job. And… I believe I had some wisdom teeth removed at some point. But that hardly counts as surgery, does it? A bit of discomfort, then it was over. I don't believe I've had any other procedures. Nothing major, thankfully. I've always been rather lucky in that regard. A robust constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… now that’s a complicated question, Doctor. My father… he lived a long life, thankfully. A farmer, very sturdy fellow. He was prone to… grumbling, I suppose. But nothing serious. My mother… she passed away relatively young, I believe. Something about… her heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t terribly close to her, if I'm being honest. As for siblings, I had a brother, but he moved to America many years ago and I haven’t heard from him since. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a terribly close-knit family. Everyone kept to themselves, mostly. It’s a bit of a blur, truthfully. I don’t recall any specific illnesses running in the family. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. Perhaps there was something, but it’s been so long. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's alright. Let's move on to your social history, then. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. A dreadful habit. Disgusting, really. My first wife smoked, terribly unhealthy woman. Nearly choked the house out with that awful smell. I made her smoke outside, of course. I've always considered it a rather vulgar practice. No, I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I have no intention of ever starting. A perfectly sensible choice, if you ask me. Good health is far more important than a bit of… momentary pleasure. Honestly, Doctor, I can't imagine why anyone would want to smoke. A terrible, dreadful habit. Simply awful.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… hmm. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A perfectly sensible habit, I believe. A good red wine, with a bit of cheese… very relaxing. Nothing excessive, of course. Just a glass, or perhaps two, on a quiet evening. I wouldn’t say I need it, but it’s a pleasant accompaniment to a good meal. I used to drink more when I was younger, of course. But I’ve cut back in recent years. A bit of moderation is key, you see. It's important to enjoy life’s little pleasures, in sensible quantities. Nothing that could interfere with my health, of course. A perfectly reasonable habit, I believe. Perhaps a glass of Merlot tonight, if the mood strikes me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me see… I recall having a rather unpleasant reaction to some medication years ago. Some sort of antibiotic, I believe. It gave me a terrible rash. But I can't recall the name of it, unfortunately. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see. As for foods… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been able to eat just about anything. Perhaps a bit of indigestion occasionally, but nothing serious. No shellfish, though. I've never been particularly fond of it, honestly. And pollen. I sneeze a bit in the spring, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just a bit of… seasonal discomfort. No, I don’t believe I have any serious allergies. Nothing that requires any special attention, thankfully. A robust constitution, you see. I'm generally quite resilient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. That gives me a good overview. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… well, I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? I must say, I’m not terribly fond of doctors poking and prodding, but I understand it’s necessary. Very well, Doctor. Let's get it over with. Though, I do hope it won't take too long. I have a garden to tend to, you know. And a perfectly good glass of wine with my name on it. Proceed when you're ready. But please, be gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Oriley. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Alright, a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal with a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Next, I’ll take a look at your throat. Throat looks clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Mild tenderness in the lower back area. Finally, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems relatively normal, Mr. Oriley, but your blood pressure is a bit elevated and you do have tenderness in your lower back. We should monitor your blood pressure regularly. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: A blood pressure cuff? Good heavens, no! I haven’t the slightest use for such a contraption. I’m perfectly capable of knowing how I feel, thank you very much. A little tenderness in my back? Well, I told you. I’m not as young as I used to be. It’s perfectly normal. Monitoring it? Seems rather excessive, if you ask me. Is this necessary, Doctor? It all sounds rather… alarming. Perhaps I simply need a bit of rest and a good glass of wine. Honestly, I think you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. But very well. If you insist. What exactly do I need to do with this… contraption? And how often should I be… monitoring myself? It all sounds rather tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Oriley. It’s not about making a mountain out of a molehill, it’s about being proactive. Elevated blood pressure can lead to more serious issues if left unaddressed. It's a simple precaution. I can write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. They are quite easy to use. You take your blood pressure at the same time each day, preferably in the morning and evening, and record the results. Bring the readings to your next appointment, and we’ll see how they are trending. Do you have any questions about using a home blood pressure monitor, or would you like me to show you how to use one now?
PATIENT: A prescription… for a machine? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite ridiculous. I suppose I have no choice, if you insist. But I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of managing my own health. A bit of rest and a sensible diet have always been sufficient. And yes, I suppose I'll need to know how to operate this… contraption. Though, I can't promise I'll be terribly diligent about it. A demonstration would be appreciated, if it's not too much trouble. But please, keep it brief. I have a garden to tend to, you know. And a perfectly good glass of wine with my name on it. This is all rather… inconvenient, if you ask me. But very well. Show me how this… machine… works.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Oriley. It's quite straightforward. You simply slip the cuff around your upper arm, making sure it's snug but not too tight. Then, press the start button, and it will measure your blood pressure. The results will display on the screen. You want to aim for a reading below 140/90 mmHg. I'll write down a log for you to keep track of your readings. Just note the date and time, and your systolic and diastolic numbers. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Systolic and diastolic… Good heavens, this is becoming needlessly complicated. A log, you say? Dates and numbers… Honestly, it sounds like a dreadful amount of paperwork. I suppose I can manage it, but I can’t promise I’ll be terribly accurate. My handwriting isn’t what it once was, you see. And what if the numbers are… high? What exactly am I supposed to do then? Am I to rush to the emergency room? Or simply… ignore it? Honestly, Doctor, you’re causing me unnecessary anxiety. But very well. I'll attempt to monitor these… numbers. But don't expect a terribly detailed report. A bit of rest and a sensible diet have always been sufficient. And a glass of wine, of course. A perfectly good glass of wine. That’s what I need. Not a machine and a log. But very well. Show me where to find this... emergency room. Just in case. Though I highly doubt I'll be needing it.
DOCTOR: No, you won't need to rush to the emergency room. If your readings are consistently high, then we'll discuss it at your next appointment. We might consider medication or further testing. This is simply a preventative measure, Mr. Oriley, to help us stay ahead of any potential issues. The emergency room is located at St. Jude’s Hospital, about ten minutes from here. I’ll write down the address and phone number for you. But please, don’t worry about it. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: St. Jude’s, you say? Very well. I suppose it's good to know. But honestly, Doctor, I highly doubt I’ll be needing it. A bit of rest and a sensible diet, that’s what I need. And a perfectly good glass of wine, of course. No, I don't believe I have any further questions. You’ve burdened me with enough information as it is. A machine, a log, numbers… Honestly, it’s quite overwhelming. I suppose I’ll be off then. I have a garden to tend to, you know. And a perfectly good glass of wine with my name on it. Thank you… I suppose. Though I can't say I'm terribly pleased with this whole experience. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. You take care now. And remember, if you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And enjoy your garden and your wine! Good day to you as well.
