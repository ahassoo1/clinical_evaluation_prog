DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Mr. Barban! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My name is Kiwane Barban. I am here for… a check-up. Before the insurance… starts, yes? I have Medicare. It is important to do this now, before… things change.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Barban. A proactive check-up is always a good idea, especially with insurance changes happening. I see you’ve got Medicare, that’s helpful. Let's start with a little bit about why you thought a check-up was a good idea now. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted you to schedule this appointment, or is this more of a general wellness check?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, no symptoms. I do not feel sick. It is just… sensible. A good man takes care of things before they become problems. Like maintaining a car, yes? You change the oil, you check the tires… before something breaks. It is… preventative. I do not understand why everyone does not do this.
DOCTOR: I completely agree, Mr. Barban. That’s a very sensible approach! Preventative care is incredibly important – you're absolutely right, it’s like maintaining a car. It’s much easier to catch things early, or even prevent problems altogether. Okay, so a general wellness check then. Let's go through a bit of your medical history to get a baseline. Have you had a family doctor before?
PATIENT: A family doctor? No. Not really. Back home… things were different. We did not… visit doctors much. Only when… very necessary. A little headache, a little pain… you rest, you drink tea. This is how my father did things, and his father before him. It is not something I am… used to. Perhaps that is why I am here, yes? To get… used to it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Barban. That’s very common, especially when coming from a different background. It sounds like you're taking a great step in prioritizing your health now. Okay, well we can definitely get you started with a thorough check-up. Let's start with some questions about your past medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: No. I have never been… told I have any of those things. I work hard. Very hard. Food processing… it is physical work. Lifting, moving… I am strong. I eat… reasonably. Mostly rice, some fish, vegetables when they are available. I do not sit around much, so I do not think I have problems with… blood pressure or… the sugar thing. But I am not a doctor, yes?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're staying active, Mr. Barban! That’s a big part of staying healthy. And you’re right, you’re not a doctor, and that’s why we’re here – to get a better understanding. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And… hospital? Only once. When I was a small boy. I fell from a tree. Broke my arm. It was… not a good experience. Many people, many smells… I do not like hospitals. I prefer to avoid them, yes? That is why I am doing this… preventative thing. To stay out of the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Barban. Hospitals aren't usually a pleasant experience. It's good you're taking steps to avoid needing one! Let's talk about your family. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My father… he passed away last year. A long life, thankfully. But… it was difficult. My mother… she is still living. In Yemen. I… speak to her sometimes, when I can. It is… expensive to call. And the connection is not always good. She is… getting older, of course. But she is strong, like me. She did not need doctors much either, yes? She always said hard work is the best medicine.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Barban. It sounds like your father lived a full life. And it sounds like you come from a very resilient family. Okay, just a few more questions about your health history, then we can move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat many things. Fish, rice, dates… sometimes lamb, when I can afford it. I have never had… a reaction. Perhaps a little… upset stomach sometimes, if the food is old. But that is not an allergy, yes? It is just… bad food. I do not take medications either. I prefer not to. Unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no current medications. That's good. Now, before we get to the exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. Long hours. I live simply. I eat, I sleep, I work. I send money to my mother. Sometimes I go to the market. I do not… go out much. It is not… necessary. I do not drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. Is that what you mean by lifestyle? It is a… practical life.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, that's exactly what I meant! A practical life. That gives me a good understanding. Alright, let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… acceptable. But please be quick. I have work this afternoon. And I do not enjoy being… touched unnecessarily. I trust you are a professional, yes? Just do what is needed. No need for… extra things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. I completely understand and respect that. I will keep the exam as efficient and professional as possible. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Do you have any history of shortness of breath or wheezing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I lift heavy things all day. Sometimes I am… tired, but that is different. I have never… wheezed. Never. It is not a problem I have ever experienced. Food processing is hard work, yes? It requires strength, not… delicate breathing. Perhaps if I sat around more… but I do not.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Let’s take a look at your ears and throat now. Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little red, but no signs of infection. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. All feels normal here. Do you have any pain anywhere right now?
PATIENT: No pain. Not at this moment. Sometimes my back aches… after a long shift. But that is… expected. It is part of the work. I rub some ointment on it, and it gets better. Nothing serious. I am a strong man, yes? A little back ache is not… a concern. Is this all? I really must get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Barban. Everything feels normal based on the physical exam. The slight redness in your throat could just be from dry air, and the occasional back pain is likely from your physically demanding job. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the fact that you haven't had a check-up in a while, I would like to order some basic blood work. This will help us get a baseline of your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? More… poking and prodding? Is it absolutely necessary? I do not like hospitals, and this sounds… similar. Will it take long? And how much will it cost? I do not have much money. I send most of it to my mother, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Barban. It’s not a hospital, and it’s just a quick blood draw, not a long procedure at all – about 10-15 minutes. It's done here in the clinic, so you won’t have to go to a hospital. And yes, Medicare should cover most of the cost. We can check your coverage before we proceed to make sure. It will give us a really good picture of your overall health, and it's good to have that information as a baseline. It can help us catch anything early on if needed. Would you like me to check your Medicare coverage now and get the cost estimate for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Check the Medicare. If it is too expensive… then no. I cannot afford to spend much money on… tests. I need to send it to my mother, yes? She needs it more than I do. Just tell me the cost, and I will decide. But quickly, please. I am losing work time.
DOCTOR: Okay, one moment… Okay, good news. The basic blood panel is fully covered by your Medicare plan. There is no out-of-pocket cost for you. So, it won’t affect the money you send to your mother. Does that change things?
PATIENT: Fully covered? No cost? Well… that is… acceptable. If it costs nothing… then I suppose it is alright. I still do not like being poked and prodded, but… if it is free… then do it. Quickly, please. I have work to do. And tell me how long it will take.
DOCTOR: Great. It will only take about 10-15 minutes. I'll just need to draw a few vials of blood. The phlebotomist will be right in to take care of that. I'll let you know the results as soon as they come back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I do not understand… medical things. I just work. You take the blood, and then you tell me if there is a problem. That is all. Do not speak to me about… complicated things. I will not understand. Just tell me if I need to rest more, or if I need to… change something. Keep it simple, yes? Now… let us get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. I will keep everything as simple as possible. I'll just let you know if any changes need to be made. The phlebotomist is here now. They will take great care of you. She will be right with you. Thank you for coming in today. We appreciate you taking this step for your health.
