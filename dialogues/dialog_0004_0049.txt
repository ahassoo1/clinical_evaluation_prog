DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Well, now… it’s me ears, I think. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Everything’s a bit muffled, y’see? It’s hard to hear folks talkin’. Not sure when it started, really. Just kinda… happened.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, muffled. Like talkin’ through a blanket, sometimes. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps tellin’ me to get it checked. She says I’m missin’ things on the telly. And I probably am, now that I think about it. I like me Westerns, y’know. Don’t want to miss the shootouts!
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been a sudden change, or has it developed slowly over time?
PATIENT: Slowly, I reckon. Not like a bang, y’know? Just… faded. Like an old photograph. Hard to say exactly when it started gettin’ bad, though. Years, probably. I don’t pay much mind to these things. Old age, I suppose. It's what they say, anyways.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it just difficulty hearing things, or do you experience any ringing, buzzing, or fullness in either ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, maybe? A faint sort of… whine. Not all the time, thankfully. More when it’s quiet, I think. And no, not full, exactly. Just… quiet. Everything’s just quiet. It’s hard to explain. I used to be able to hear a pin drop, my mother always said. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever worked in a loud environment?
PATIENT: Loud environment… well, now. I worked at the shoe factory for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years. All those machines clatterin' and thumpin'. It was noisy, alright. Real noisy. Though, you get used to it, y’know? Didn’t bother me much at the time. I suppose it might’ve somethin’ to do with it. Don’t rightly know. We didn’t have much in the way of ear protection back then, neither.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any family history of hearing loss?
PATIENT: Family history… now that's a good question. Let me think. My brother, Arthur, he got a bit hard of hearin' later in life, I think. But he didn't take much care of himself, always fiddlin' with loud radios and such. My mother… she always said she had trouble hearin' the birds sing, but she was always a bit… delicate, y’know? Not sure if that counts. I don’t really know much about it on my mother's side of the family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve taken a bit of everything over the years, doctor. Pills for me aches and pains, creams for me skin… never had a bad reaction, not that I recall. A bit of a tummy upset now and then, but nothin' serious. I think I'm pretty tough, y’know?
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for me arthritis, now and then. Naproxen, I think it is. When me joints are botherin’ me. And sometimes I take a bit of Tylenol for the pain, if the Naproxen isn't cuttin' it. That's about it, really. I try not to take too many pills, y’know? Don't want to be relyin' on 'em too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Schneer, let's do a quick examination of your ears. It won't take long. Could you please sit forward?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. Me old ears aren't what they used to be, y'know.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm just going to take a look inside your ears with this instrument. It shouldn't be painful, but let me know if you feel any discomfort. I'm going to gently pull your ear back and up to get a better view. Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen buildup in your right ear canal. It’s obstructing the view of the tympanic membrane. And the same here on the left side. Significant cerumen impaction bilaterally. The tympanic membranes themselves appear intact, but visualization is limited due to the wax. I don’t see any signs of acute infection at this time.
PATIENT: Wax, you say? Well, now, that don’t surprise me none. I’ve always had a bit of trouble with ear wax. My daughter always naggin’ me to clean 'em out, but I never could get the hang of it. She says I’m stuffin' 'em full of cotton swabs. Maybe she's right. So, is that bad? Is that what’s makin’ me hard of hearin'?
DOCTOR: It's quite possible, Mr. Schneer. Cerumen – that's earwax – can definitely build up and block the ear canal, leading to difficulty hearing. And yes, using cotton swabs can actually push the wax further in, making the problem worse. It's a common issue, especially as we get older. It's good your daughter is encouraging you to address it. At this point, the next step is to remove the wax. We have a couple of options. We can try to manually remove it with special instruments here in the office, or I can prescribe some ear drops to soften the wax so it can work its way out on its own. The drops are usually the gentler approach. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Drops sound… easier. I don't fancy nothin’ poked around in me ears. Not much in the way of pain tolerance these days. Gentle sounds better, definitely. How long does it take for the drops to work, then? Will I be able to hear right away? I got me Westerns to catch, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, ear drops it is. Usually, it takes about three to five days of using them as directed – typically a few drops in each ear twice a day – to soften the wax enough for it to come out on its own. You may notice some slight bubbling or crackling sounds in your ears initially, which is perfectly normal. It’s likely your hearing will gradually improve over the next week or so. If the wax doesn’t come out on its own after a week, we can schedule another appointment to remove it manually. I’m going to write you a prescription for Cerumen-Lyse drops. I’ll also give you some instructions on how to use them correctly. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Three to five days, a few drops twice a day. And if it don't work, we come back. Sounds reasonable enough. Thank you, Doctor. You've put me at ease. I just want to be able to hear me Westerns again, y’know?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Schneer. We’ll do our best to get you back to enjoying your Westerns. I’m also going to give you a handout with some information about hearing loss prevention. It's important to protect your ears from further damage. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You covered everything nicely. Thank you again for your patience with an old man and his ears. And thank you for not laughin' at me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. And no laughter here, I assure you! Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any problems or concerns. Have a good day.
