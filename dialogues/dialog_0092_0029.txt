DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this… eating thing. I just don't seem to get hungry much anymore, and when I do eat, I fill up awful quick. It's been going on for a little bit now, maybe a month or so. Not sure what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A decrease in appetite and feeling full quickly, for about a month now. That’s good information to start with. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it's not like I'm not eating, Doctor. I still eat, just… not as much. And I used to be able to put away a good plate of salmon and bannock, you know? Now, a few bites and I'm done. My wife, Elsie, she worries 'cause I'm losing a bit of weight, but I haven’t been feeling sick or anything. Just…full faster. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Obarr. It sounds like you’re still consuming some food, but significantly less than usual, and reaching a feeling of fullness more quickly. The weight loss Elsie has noticed is also important. To help me understand this further, could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… usually, Elsie makes breakfast, toast and eggs mostly. I might have a piece or two of toast and a bit of the egg. Coffee, always coffee. Lunch is usually something simple, maybe a sandwich, but I only eat half of it now. Then dinner… well, Elsie tries to make something good, salmon if she can get it, or stew. But I barely touch it these days. A few spoonfuls, and that's it. I snack a little sometimes, a biscuit with tea, but not like I used to. It's just… everything feels like too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Obarr. That gives me a clearer picture. And you mentioned coffee – how many cups do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, Elsie says too many! Probably three, maybe four. I like a good strong cup, especially in the morning. It helps me wake up, you know? I've been drinking coffee for… well, since I was a young man. Always black, no sugar.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four cups of black coffee a day. I’m noting that. Now, besides the change in appetite and feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, Doctor. No stomach pain, no trouble… going to the bathroom, nothing like that. Just…tired, maybe? A little more tired than usual, but I’m 88 years old, so that could just be the age, you know? I haven’t been feeling sick, no fever or chills. Elsie says I seem a bit… quieter, but I mostly just sit and read these days anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other significant symptoms – no pain, no changes in bowel habits, no fever, and just a general feeling of being a little more tired, and perhaps a bit quieter. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was a long time ago. And the doctor said I had high blood pressure a few years back, but he put me on a little pill for it. I think I still take it… Elsie handles most of the medication, so I’m not always sure. Other than that, not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Nothing serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your appendix removed as a child, and you were diagnosed with high blood pressure, for which you are currently taking medication. Elsie manages your medications. Do you remember the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Elsie keeps track of all that. I think it's a little white pill... small one. She fills the prescription at the pharmacy every month. I really don’t pay attention to the names, just take what she gives me. Sorry, I wish I could be more help with that. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Obarr. It’s very common to have difficulty remembering medication names, and it’s good that Elsie helps manage that for you. We can always verify the medications with the pharmacy if needed. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Elsie always asks when she fills the prescriptions, and she says I haven't got any allergies listed. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I breathe the same air as everyone else, and I'm still here, aren't I? So, no, no allergies that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was still a young man, so I don’t remember much about it. My father, he lived a long life, but he had trouble with his joints when he got older. Arthritis, maybe? And my sister, she had diabetes, but I don’t think anyone else in the family has had it. That’s about all I know, really. We didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had a heart condition, your father had joint problems, and your sister had diabetes. That's helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly stay at home these days. I used to be a fisherman, but I retired years ago. Now I mostly read… books, the newspaper. Elsie and I watch TV sometimes. I don't do much exercise, to be honest. Just a little bit of walking around the house. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly I just… take it easy. It's a quiet life, but I’m content.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re retired, enjoy reading, and have a relatively quiet lifestyle. You don't smoke, and you drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Alright, Mr. Obarr. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure and pulse. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I don't mind. I'm used to doctors poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 148/85, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72, regular and steady. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight tenderness in the upper quadrants… nothing alarming, but I’ll make a note of it. Your reflexes are a little slow, which is common at your age, and I don't notice any significant swelling in your extremities. Overall, the physical exam isn't revealing anything immediately concerning, but the slight abdominal tenderness and elevated blood pressure warrant further investigation. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The decreased appetite and early satiety, combined with the weight loss, could be due to a number of factors, including changes in digestive function, medication side effects, or even early signs of a more serious condition. The abdominal tenderness could be related to this as well.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good. What sort of… serious condition? I'm not sure I want to think about that too much. Is it something I should be worried about? And what sort of tests would I need? Elsie will be worried sick.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Obarr, and I want to assure you that we're just being thorough at this point. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to rule out potential causes. One possibility we need to consider is early signs of stomach cancer, though this is just one of several possibilities. Other potential causes could include gallbladder problems or even changes in your digestive system due to age. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to check your liver function, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any blood in your stool. And, I think it would be best to get an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. I understand Elsie will be worried, and I will be sure to keep her informed every step of the way. Would you be comfortable with proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Well… tests aren’t my favourite thing, but I suppose if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I’ll go ahead. Elsie will be glad you’re being so careful. The ultrasound sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m not a fan of waiting around, especially when it comes to things like this. And who will explain the results to me? Elsie, usually? She's better with the medical stuff than I am.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Obarr. Tests aren't everyone's favorite, but they are a necessary part of the diagnostic process. The ultrasound is a non-invasive procedure – it doesn't involve any needles or radiation. A technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and then move a handheld device over your skin. It doesn't hurt at all, though you may feel a little bit of pressure. It usually takes about 30 minutes to complete. The results typically take a few days to come back, but I will expedite them as much as possible. I will personally explain the results to both you and Elsie when they are available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail, and answer any questions you may have. I will write you a requisition for the blood tests and the stool test. And I will give you instructions on how to schedule the abdominal ultrasound. I recommend scheduling it as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Just… try to hurry with those results, alright? Elsie's going to be a nervous wreck. And thank you… for being so thorough, and for explaining everything so clearly. It’s good to know you’re looking after me. I think I'll just go home now, and let Elsie know what you've said. She’ll want to get those tests scheduled right away. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Obarr. I will do my best to expedite the results. Please tell Elsie I said hello, and that I will be in touch as soon as I have them. And don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you both again soon.
