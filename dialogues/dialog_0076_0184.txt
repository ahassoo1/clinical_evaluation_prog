DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Trendler, yes. 76… Hmm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh. Well, look here. It’s about… this. It ain't what it used to be, ya know? All… loose. Wife used to say I was a strong man. Now? Look at this! Waste of good food, really. I want it fixed.
DOCTOR: “Loose,” you say. Right. And how long has it been… “loose”?
PATIENT: Loose? Lord, since she passed, mostly. Maybe five years now? Hard to say, time blurs. It weren't always this bad, mind you. Just… got worse. I ain't askin' for a miracle, just want somethin' done ‘fore it flaps in the breeze, ya hear?
DOCTOR: Five years… Okay. And besides the… looseness, any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes you talkin' about? It hurts sometimes, when I bend over. Not all the time. And… it look bad, that’s a change, isn't it? Used to have a proper shape, now it’s just… there. Don't need no fancy words, just tell me if you can pull it tight, or what.
DOCTOR: Pain when bending… Alright. Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache?
PATIENT: Dull. Mostly. Like… a heavy feeling. Not somethin' that makes me scream, ya know? Just bothersome. Like a weight. Especially after I’ve been doin' somethin'. Liftin' things, gardenin', that sort of thing. Though I ain’t done much gardenin' lately. Lost the heart for it, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kinda question is that? You askin’ about… that? Look here, I came about my stomach, not… never you mind about my bowels. That’s private! Are you gonna fix it, or what? I ain't got all day.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Trendler. We need a complete picture. Any constipation, diarrhea, blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Look, young man, I'm a simple man. I eat, I sleep, I... used to work hard. I don’t need no fancy questions about what comes out of me. No blood, if that's what you're askin'. Everything's… normal, as normal as it gets for a man my age. Stop askin' silly things and tell me if you can fix this saggin' belly! Is it possible, or is this a waste of my time?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just… skip that then. Any nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Vomitin’? Heavens no! I eat a good breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Appetite's fine. Maybe a little less than before, but I ain’t complainin’. I just want this… this problem fixed. It’s embarrassing, ya hear? Can you do it, or not? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. Lie back on the examination table. Just the stomach for now. I'll have a listen and feel around. Don't expect miracles, understand?
PATIENT: Listen and feel? What’s there to listen to? It’s a belly! Hurry it up, young man. I ain't got all day to be poked and prodded. And no funny business, ya hear?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just… feeling for any masses or tenderness. No obvious masses. Some… laxity of the abdominal wall, as you described. Bowel sounds are present, normal. As I said, nothing remarkable. It appears to be… age-related changes, some weight loss.
PATIENT: Age-related changes?! I already told you that! I want it fixed. Can you do surgery? Can you pull the skin tight? That’s what I’m payin' you for! Don't just tell me what I already know, tell me what you can do about it! I ain't gettin' any younger, ya know?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Trendler. A tummy tuck—that’s what you're asking about—is… a significant procedure. It carries risks. And frankly, at your age, the risks outweigh the benefits. There's a possibility of complications – infection, bleeding, poor wound healing. And it won't address any underlying medical issues. Frankly, I don’t recommend it. We can discuss lifestyle changes—diet, exercise—to improve muscle tone. That’s the best option.
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes?! Exercise?! Young man, I built houses for fifty years! I’m tired! And diet? I eat perfectly good food! You're tellin' me I wasted my money comin’ here to be told to eat less and walk more? I want a solution, not a lecture! I saw it on TV! People your age get these things done all the time! I want a tummy tuck! Find someone who will do it, or I'm goin' somewhere else! This is ridiculous! .
