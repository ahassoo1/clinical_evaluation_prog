DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… it’s… the pee. Yes, the pee is hard. It doesn’t… come easy, you know? Like pushing a rock. It’s been like that for… a little while now, I think. Not a big problem, but… annoying.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds frustrating. When you say it doesn't come easy, could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it just takes a long time. I have to… push. And sometimes it stops and starts. Like a little stream, then nothing, then a little stream again. It’s not… strong, if you know what I mean. And I feel like… I don't get all of it out, sometimes. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining. My mind… it wanders, you know?
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. Don't apologize at all; you’re explaining it very well. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty starting your stream of urine, a weaker stream than usual, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Oh… gradually, I think. Yes, that’s it. It didn't just happen one day. It’s been… getting worse slowly. Maybe a few months, or… longer? I’m not good with dates, Doctor. My husband usually keeps track of things like that. He's… not here today. He's at the market. Getting mangoes, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen, that’s helpful to know. A few months of gradual onset is important. And it’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure of exact dates. Now, besides the difficulty with urination, have you noticed any other changes or symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think… sometimes I feel… a little uncomfortable down there. Not pain, exactly. Just… a dull ache. And I have to… get up at night sometimes. To pee. More than I used to, I think. My husband says I snore a lot too, but that’s always been the case. He complains, but… I don’t remember much about it. Is that what you mean? Other symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stoffregen, that’s exactly what I mean. The dull ache and getting up at night to urinate are both relevant. Getting up at night is what we call nocturia. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, fever, or chills?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh no, no blood. Not that I’ve seen. I always look, you know. Just to be sure. No fever either. I feel a little warm sometimes, but that's just the weather. It’s been very hot lately. And no chills… no, definitely no chills. I haven’t felt sick, not really. Just… old. You know? Is that a symptom? Being old?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. And no, being old isn’t a symptom! It's just part of life. Thank you for answering my questions so thoroughly. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That’s a hard one. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Very long ago. And… my blood pressure, I think, is a little high. The doctor gives me pills for it. A little white pill, I think. And… oh! Arthritis. Yes, arthritis in my hands. Makes it hard to… button my clothes sometimes. That’s about it, I think. I forget things so easily. My husband does all the remembering, usually. He takes me to the doctor… most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, that’s very helpful. So, gallbladder removal in the past, high blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I wish I knew. It's… a little white pill. Small. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My husband fills the little container for me. He knows all these things. I really don’t pay attention to names. I just take the pills he gives me. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Ms. Stoffregen. It's common to rely on someone else for medication management. We can look it up in your records, if you don't mind. Okay, I see here you're currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh… Lisinopril. Yes, that sounds right. A long name. My husband always says it very carefully. Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. He's very good with these things. So glad he fills my little container. I'd be lost without him.
DOCTOR: Good. That confirms it. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty lucky. I can eat anything. My husband makes me mango pudding sometimes, and that's full of everything. No hives, no itching, no trouble breathing. Just a happy tummy. And I haven't noticed anything in the garden that bothers me. I love to sit outside and watch the birds. No, I don't think I have any allergies. Unless you count husbands… they can be a bit of a bother sometimes!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, before we move on, could you tell me about any past surgeries you’ve had, besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… besides the gallbladder… Oh! I had a bunion removed from my foot, years ago. Very painful, that was. Took a long time to heal. And… I think that’s it. Maybe I had my tonsils out when I was a child? I don’t remember very well. Everything was so long ago. My husband says I’ve had a full life, lots of adventures… and lots of doctor visits!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Stoffregen. So, gallbladder removal, bunion removal, and possibly tonsillectomy in childhood. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s a hard one. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my brother… he had trouble with his kidneys, I remember. He had to go to the hospital a lot. And… oh! My aunt, she had diabetes. Very bad. Had to watch what she ate all the time. That’s about all I remember, really. My family… they weren't very good at talking about these things. It was always a bit of a secret.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, that’s helpful to know. History of heart problems in your mother, kidney issues in your brother, and diabetes in your aunt. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle… Well, I mostly stay home these days. I like to sit in my garden and watch the birds. My husband does all the heavy work. He's very strong. I do a little bit of cooking, but not much. I used to be very active, but my arthritis makes it hard to get around. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small glass. It helps me relax. And I try to get a good night’s sleep, but I wake up a few times to pee. That’s about it, I think. A quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a gentle abdominal exam. We’ll also do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… fine. As long as it’s not too rough. My old bones are a bit fragile, you know. And please be gentle with my tummy. It gets a bit sore sometimes. And don't mind if I close my eyes. It makes me a little nervous. Just take your time, Doctor. And tell me if you see anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I'll be very gentle. Just relax. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is not surprising given your history. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your abdomen is mildly tender, but nothing alarming. Your neurological function appears normal. I also noticed a little swelling in your ankles. Have you noticed that before?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh yes, now that you mention it… my ankles do feel a bit puffy sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just from sitting too long. My husband says I should put my feet up more often. He's always telling me what to do! Is that bad, Doctor? Is my body falling apart?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily falling apart, Ms. Stoffregen, not at all. The swelling, along with your symptoms of difficulty urinating, nocturia, and the mild tenderness in your abdomen, gives me a few things to consider. Given your age and medical history, it could be a few things. Now, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I want to check your kidney function with a blood test, and I want to do a urinalysis to check for any infection or other abnormalities in your urine. I'd also like to do a prostate specific antigen blood test, as this can help rule out any prostate problems, even in women, as it can indicate overall inflammation in the urinary tract. Finally, let's order a bladder ultrasound to see how well your bladder is emptying. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. So many tests! A blood test, a pee test, a… a what test? And a picture of my bladder? That sounds… complicated. But if it helps, then… alright. Yes, let’s do the tests. My husband always says it’s best to know what’s going on. He’s a very practical man. He'll probably come with me to the lab. He's good at all these things. But… will it hurt? I don't like needles. And I hope the picture doesn’t show anything scary.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to feel a little anxious, Ms. Stoffregen. It is a few tests, but they will help us understand what’s going on. The blood test will just involve a small prick of the finger or arm. We can use a local anesthetic cream to numb the area if you'd like. The urinalysis is simply a sample of your urine in a cup. As for the ultrasound, it's completely painless and non-invasive. It's similar to a pregnancy scan—we just use a gel on your abdomen and a handheld device to create an image of your bladder. It won't show anything scary, it just helps us see what’s happening inside. I’ll write the orders for the lab now, and the lab will schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any questions about the tests or the procedure?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You explained it very well, Doctor. Just… a small prick, a pee in a cup, and a picture. I can handle that. My husband will be with me, so I won’t be alone. He always makes me feel better. He'll probably ask a lot of questions though. He's very thorough. And he'll want to know all the results right away. He's a bit of a worrier, you see. But… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so carefully. And for being so gentle.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m glad I could reassure you. And don't worry about your husband—it's good that he’s involved and cares about your health. He's welcome to ask as many questions as he likes. In the meantime, please continue to drink plenty of fluids, and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your lower abdomen, please call the office immediately. Once the lab results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Drink fluids, avoid coffee… and call if it hurts. I can remember that. You've been very kind. Thank you again. Now… I suppose I should go find my husband. He's probably wondering where I am. He gets worried, you know. It was nice meeting you, Doctor Giganti.
DOCTOR: It was nice meeting you too, Ms. Stoffregen. Please give my best to your husband. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
