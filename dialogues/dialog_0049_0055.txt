DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, I’ve heard… things. About this medical marijuana. My niece, bless her heart, she suggested I look into it for… discomfort. Though frankly, I still think it’s a rather silly notion. But she insisted, and I do try to be reasonable. So here I am.
DOCTOR: Discomfort… right. Could you be a little more specific about what kind of discomfort you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, must we go through all of this? It’s… aches. Old age, mostly. A bit of stiffness in the joints, particularly my knees. It’s not debilitating, mind you. I still manage. But it’s… bothersome. And it’s becoming more frequent, if you understand. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Aches and stiffness…primarily in the knees, getting more frequent. And you’re considering medical marijuana for this. Have you tried anything else for the discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, of course I have! What do you think I am, some sort of…indulgent young woman? I’ve tried liniments. Rub-ons. Hot baths. My husband makes me drink that dreadful turmeric tea. Nothing truly works, you see. That’s why I’m here. Though I still maintain it’s a bit much, all this fuss over a few aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Right. And when did this… discomfort begin, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It started… oh, goodness, probably five or six years ago. Slowly, you understand? Not a sudden thing. Just a little more ache each year, a little less… spring in my step. It’s been gradual. It’s not as if I woke up one day crippled, Doctor. Really, I'm quite capable. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Five or six years ago, gradual onset. Any specific activities that make it worse?
PATIENT: Well, obviously stairs. And long walks. Anything that requires… effort, really. I used to be quite the gardener, you know. Now… now it’s a bit much. Though I do still supervise, of course. My husband does most of the heavy lifting these days. He’s a good man, but he doesn’t have my eye for detail. Honestly, the whole thing is rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Stairs and long walks exacerbate the discomfort. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… cold weather, certainly. Dampness. And… sitting for too long, actually. It gets stiff. Though I suppose that’s hardly surprising, is it? It’s just… everything makes it a little worse these days. It’s the price one pays for a long life, I suppose. Though I do wish it weren’t quite so bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain in other areas of your body?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Just my knees, primarily. A little in my hips sometimes, but nothing… serious. I am not falling apart, Doctor. I simply have a touch of… age-related stiffness. I do maintain a good posture, you know. And I walk regularly, when the weather permits. I’m not some sort of invalid.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discomfort?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean, “symptoms”? I have aches and pains, Doctor. Is that not enough? No, I haven't any…fever. No dizziness. I sleep fine, thank you very much. And my appetite is perfectly normal. I do enjoy a good meal, you know. I’m a perfectly healthy woman, despite my age. Really. I’m just… looking into options. Though I’m still skeptical, I must admit. It all seems rather…frivolous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just quickly review your medical history here… It appears you haven't had a comprehensive physical exam in… some time. Would you mind if I did a quick assessment of your knees, hips, and range of motion?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, Doctor. I came here for a certification, not a full medical examination. I assure you, I know my own body. And I haven't the time for unnecessary… fuss. I’m perfectly capable of walking, thank you very much. I simply thought perhaps this… marijuana might offer some small relief. But if it involves all this… poking and prodding, I’m not sure it’s worth it. Really, I'd prefer to just discuss the…requirements.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, a proper assessment is vital to determine if you are a suitable candidate for medical marijuana, and to rule out other potential causes of your discomfort. It's about ensuring your safety. I'm not suggesting you're not capable, but I have a professional obligation to gather all necessary information. I can't ethically provide a certification without it. Perhaps we should discuss whether this is the right course of action for you.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is preposterous! I came here with a simple request, and now you’re telling me I need to be… examined? I’ve lived a long and full life, and I assure you, I know my own body perfectly well. I don’t need a young doctor telling me what’s wrong with me. I think I've wasted enough of my time. I'll find someone else, thank you very much. Someone who respects my…autonomy. .
