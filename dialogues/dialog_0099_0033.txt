DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Julie, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… it’s rather inconvenient, this whole business. I seem to be… not seeing and hearing things as clearly as I used to. It just came on suddenly, you understand? A most unsettling development. I have important engagements, you know.
DOCTOR: Suddenly, you say. And how suddenly is suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s difficult to say precisely. A few days, I suppose. Though it might have been longer. Time rather… slips away, doesn't it? It wasn’t gradual, certainly. One morning, things were… acceptable. The next, rather blurry and muffled. It’s quite bothersome, really. I have a luncheon to attend next week, and I simply must be presentable.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, blurry vision and muffled hearing developing over a few days. Let’s try to be a little more specific. With the vision – is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both, I believe. Though I haven’t taken the time to… analyze it, Doctor. One doesn’t simply go about testing one’s eyesight, you know. It’s… a general haziness. Like looking through a slightly dirty window, perhaps? And it’s terribly distracting. I do hope it isn’t anything serious. I have a very full schedule.
DOCTOR: Right. And the muffled hearing – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I should think. Though, truthfully, I rarely listen to much worth hearing. All this modern… noise. Still, it makes conversation… challenging. I find myself asking people to repeat themselves, which is terribly impolite, don’t you agree? It's simply unacceptable to have to strain to hear. Really, Doctor, I trust you can fix this quickly?
DOCTOR: We’ll see what we can do. Let’s get a little bit of background, if you don’t mind. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, Doctor, is this a detective novel? I simply don’t do symptoms. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, you understand. Perhaps a slight headache, occasionally. But that’s likely due to the… stress of managing my affairs. And a touch of fatigue, naturally. One does get tired, doesn't one? But nothing that would warrant… a thorough investigation. Honestly, I find all these questions rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on then. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, dear. Let me think… well, there's a small something for my blood pressure, prescribed by Dr. Ramirez, ages ago. And occasionally, a mild sedative if I can't sleep. But that's only when absolutely necessary, you understand. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. Honestly, Doctor, I don't make a habit of filling my system with… chemicals. It's simply not a good look. Do you require a list? I doubt I recall all the names, truthfully. It changes, you know.
DOCTOR: The record indicates Lisinopril 10mg daily and Trazodone 50mg as needed. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness, no. I am perfectly healthy, Doctor. Though… I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin as a child. A small rash, I believe. But that was… decades ago. I doubt it’s relevant now. Honestly, I find it rather insulting that you're questioning my health. I assure you, I have a very strong constitution. A little blurry vision and muffled hearing is hardly cause for alarm. Though I do expect a swift resolution to this… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I’ll check your ears, eyes, and a basic neurological assessment. It will just take a few minutes. Please sit forward. Opening your mouth, please… ah. Mild cerumen impaction bilaterally. Nothing overtly concerning. Now, let’s check your eyes… follow my finger… left, right… up, down. Good. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light…but slightly diminished response. Visual acuity… can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't worn glasses in years. It’s… embarrassing to be subjected to such a test. I can make out… some of the letters. Though it’s terribly blurry, as I’ve already explained. Are you certain this is necessary? I have a very important luncheon to attend, and I’m wasting valuable time here. It’s…quite bothersome. Just tell me what's wrong, Doctor. Don't make me read charts.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it appears your vision is significantly reduced. And your hearing… … diminished bilaterally, particularly at higher frequencies. Given your age and these findings, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be age-related hearing loss, a problem with the optic nerve, or even something more serious. I’m going to order an audiogram to assess your hearing and a referral to an ophthalmologist for a full eye exam. We also need to rule out other potential causes, so I’m ordering a basic blood panel. Do you have any family history of hearing loss or vision problems?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor, I barely speak to my family. They're…quite dreadful people. As for medical histories, I have no idea. They never discuss such unpleasant things. My mother was rather… vague about everything. And my brother… well, let's just say he wasn't known for his clarity of thought. I doubt they would know anything useful. Honestly, you're wasting your time asking about them. Just… fix me, Doctor. That’s all that matters. I have a reputation to maintain. Do you think these tests will take long? Because I absolutely must be at that luncheon.
DOCTOR: The tests will take a few days to schedule and complete, Ms. Julie. Until we have the results, I recommend avoiding loud noises and bright lights. I'll also prescribe a mild steroid nasal spray to see if we can reduce any inflammation contributing to the hearing loss. In the meantime, please monitor your symptoms and if you experience any sudden changes, such as dizziness, severe headache, or vision loss, go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Goodness, no. I have never set foot in an emergency room, and I certainly don’t intend to start now. Steroid nasal spray… very well. Though I do hope it doesn’t have any unpleasant side effects. I have a very important luncheon to attend, and I absolutely cannot afford to be… unwell. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather inconvenient. I trust you’ve documented everything thoroughly? And can I have a copy of these… results, whenever they are available? I have a very capable assistant who handles all my medical affairs. I simply haven’t the time to deal with such trivial matters. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Yes, everything will be documented and forwarded to your assistant. Here is a copy of the referral for the ophthalmologist and the prescription for the nasal spray. Please follow up with the specialists as soon as possible. Have a good day, Ms. Julie.
