DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh. Good morning to you too, Doctor. They tell me I have to come. Something about the mine? I feel fine, you know. Been working that mine for… long time. Never had trouble. But the young people, they worry too much these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You’ve been working at the mine for a long time and generally feel well. Just to be clear, is this a new request from someone—perhaps your employer or a family member—or is this a routine check-up they've scheduled for you due to the nature of your work?
PATIENT: Routine check-up. Employer, I think. New people in charge. Always changing things. They send a paper, say I must come. Waste of my time, frankly. But I came. So, what do you want to know? Don’t ask me about feelings, I don’t do feelings.
DOCTOR: No feelings required, Mr. Bigger. Just some information to make sure everything is alright. We appreciate you coming in. Let’s start with a little bit about your health generally. Have you had any major illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm. Let me think. Old age, I suppose. But not hospital hospital. Just… the aches and pains. Like everyone my age. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree. That’s it, really. Nothing serious. Doctor, are you writing all this down? Waste of paper if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am, Mr. Bigger. It’s important to have a complete picture. And even small things can be helpful. So, broken arm as a child, good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had any surgeries. Why would I need surgeries? I work with my hands, strong hands. They haven’t needed fixing. Though my wife… she had something done on her knee, many years ago. But that’s her story, not mine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries for you. That’s good. Now, thinking about your family – your parents, siblings, children – has anyone in your family had any serious health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my mother, she lived a long life, but she died old. Very old. Father too. They had… the usual things. Old people things. I don’t know what you call them, these fancy diseases. No cancer that I know of. My sister, she had bad legs, couldn’t walk well. But that was just… how she was. Many children, many troubles, but nothing… serious like you said.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, mother and father lived to a good age, some issues with legs in your sister’s family. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Mangoes, yams, fish… everything! Never had any trouble. No itchy skin, no swelling… I am a strong man, Doctor. I don’t get allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s very good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take medications. Never needed them. Herbal supplements? What are those? Sounds like foolishness. I eat good food, that's all I need. Maybe a little palm wine sometimes, but that's not a medication!
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. That’s fine. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about what you do at the mine?
PATIENT: What I do? I operate the machines. Big machines! Move the rocks, dig the holes. Been doing it for… long time. Heavy work. But strong work. I'm the best machine operator they have. They try to get young boys to do it, but they can’t handle it. Too soft.
DOCTOR: That sounds like very physically demanding work, Mr. Bigger. And you've been doing it for a long time. Do you have any trouble breathing, any chest pain, or cough while you're working or even at rest?
PATIENT: Trouble breathing? No. I breathe just fine, thank you very much. Chest pain? Never. Cough? Sometimes, after a lot of dust, but what do you expect? It's a mine! Dust comes with the job.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Hmph. What for? I told you, I’m fine! But… fine. Do your exam. But don't waste my time if you're not going to find anything. And be gentle with the blood pressure thing. Hates that machine.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t squeeze it too tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s 150 over 90. A little on the higher side. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but I hear some diminished breath sounds at the bases. “Heart: Regular rhythm, grade 1/2 murmur auscultated. Lungs: Clear bilaterally, diminished breath sounds at bases.” Okay. Now, let's just check your pulse in your feet. Pulses are present, but slightly weak. “Extremities: Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.” Alright, Mr. Bigger. That’s all for the quick exam.
PATIENT: Hmph. See? What did I tell you? Everything's fine. A little weak… I walk a lot, you know. Old age. Don’t make a big deal out of it. Now, are we done here? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bigger, while everything seems fine, there are a few things I’d like to discuss. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulses are a bit weak. The diminished breath sounds at the bases of your lungs also warrant some further investigation. Given your work in the mine, and these findings, I'd like to order a chest x-ray to rule out any potential lung issues. We should also repeat your blood pressure reading at a later date to get a more accurate result. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Hmph. What for? More foolishness. I told you, I’m fine. Dust, you said it yourself. It’s a mine! I don’t want any x-rays. Waste of time, waste of money. And I don't like radiation. No, no x-rays. You're just trying to find something that isn't there. Now, can I go?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your concerns. But the x-ray isn't about finding something isn't there, it’s about making sure everything is alright. It’s a precaution, given the nature of your work and some subtle findings from my exam. It's a relatively quick and painless procedure, and it can give us valuable information. If you’re concerned about radiation, the amount is very small. However, if you are absolutely opposed to the x-ray, we can proceed without it. But I strongly recommend it. If not an X-ray, perhaps a referral to a pulmonologist for an evaluation of your lung function?
PATIENT: Pulmon… what did you say? Sounds complicated. No. No complicated things. I don't want anyone poking around in my lungs. Look, Doctor, I've been working that mine for a long time. Long time. Never had trouble. I feel fine. And I don’t want any poking or x-rays or whatever you call it. I think I've had enough of this. Are we finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I respect your decision. However, I do want to emphasize the importance of monitoring your blood pressure regularly. I can provide you with a referral to a local pharmacy that offers blood pressure checks. I will also document our discussion in your chart, and you are welcome to schedule a follow-up appointment if you experience any changes in your condition, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or increased fatigue. Here is the information for the pharmacy offering blood pressure checks. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… try not to worry too much, Doctor. Some things you just have to live with. Now, if you'll excuse me… And don't send me back for more foolishness. .
