DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello, Doctor. Thank you. It’s… the flushing. I get very red in the face. It happens sometimes, and it’s been happening more lately, I think. Not sure why though. It’s a little… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Flushing, alright. And you say it's been happening more recently?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe the last… two, three months? Before that, it was just now and then. Like, if I was… you know… lifting something heavy, or getting a little angry. But now… sometimes it just happens when I'm sitting. Or eating. It doesn't seem to have a reason.
DOCTOR: So, it's becoming more frequent and less predictable. Any other symptoms with the flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart feels… a little fast, when it happens. Not racing, just… quicker than normal. And… I think I sweat a little more on my face when I get red. But that could just be because I'm warm. It’s very hot outside, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this happening at any particular time of day, or after certain foods?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t think so. I eat… mostly rice and vegetables. Sometimes chicken. Nothing spicy. It could be after… tea, maybe? I drink a lot of tea. Black tea, with a little milk. But I drink tea every day, so I wouldn’t think that’s it. It just… comes and goes. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history? My wife… she passed away five years ago. She didn’t have this problem. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she had arthritis. But nothing like… getting red. No. I don't think so. We didn’t talk about these things much, you know? It wasn’t… our way.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy, you know? And allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little dust sometimes, but that’s all. It’s just the flushing, Doctor. It’s very bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a quick look at your vitals. And then we’ll do a brief physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature... just standard stuff.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know why I’m getting so red all the time. It's making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is 88, regular. Temperature is normal. Lungs sound clear. I don’t feel any obvious masses in your neck. Skin is warm to the touch. Tell me, are you experiencing any night sweats, weight loss, or prolonged fevers?
PATIENT: No, no night sweats. And I haven't lost any weight. I eat a good breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My wife always said I ate too much! And no fevers, Doctor. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just because of the weather. It’s very hot, you know? Just the flushing. That's all. It’s the only thing bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms, age, and slightly elevated blood pressure, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be something benign, like rosacea, or it could be related to your blood pressure. However, given the increased frequency and the fact that it’s unpredictable, we should rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. This will give us a baseline and help us identify any underlying issues. We’ll also need to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot of tests. Is it… serious? My wife… she didn't like doctors very much. She said they always wanted to do too many tests. But… if you think it’s necessary, I will do them. I just want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, it's standard procedure to rule things out. Your wife’s preferences are not relevant to the appropriate care of your health. It’s better to be thorough, especially considering the recent changes in your symptoms. The tests are relatively simple. We'll take a blood sample here in the clinic, and the EKG is a quick, painless procedure. We need to gather information before we can make any conclusions. It’s far more responsible than simply dismissing your concerns. I will have the lab technician draw your blood now. Then, we’ll get you scheduled for the EKG. Do you have any questions about the procedures themselves?
PATIENT: No… no questions. You're right. It’s best to be careful. I just… I don’t want to cause any trouble. And I don't have much money, you know? Will these tests… be very expensive?
DOCTOR: The cost will depend on your insurance coverage, which you stated you don’t have. The clinic does offer a sliding fee scale based on income. We can discuss that with the billing department after the tests are completed. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. The lab technician is ready for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Follow me.
PATIENT: Okay. Lead the way, Doctor. I hope they don't find anything… serious.
DOCTOR: The technician will explain everything to you. Just try to relax. The sooner we get these results, the sooner we can figure out what’s going on.
PATIENT: .
