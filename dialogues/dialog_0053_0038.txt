DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I believe I need to make some arrangements… for the future. Something about what happens if… well, if I can’t make decisions for myself. I was advised to get a form, I think? An Advance Directive, perhaps? It was a… a friend who mentioned it. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive, yes. A sensible precaution, I suppose, though at your age… It’s good you’re thinking ahead, but let’s not jump to conclusions about needing one just yet. We'll need to determine why you think you might need this. You said your memory isn’t what it used to be?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… correct. It’s not a sudden thing, not exactly. More like… gaps. Vague recollections. Important things, sometimes. My… my divorce, for instance. I remember the feeling, the sadness… but the details are… hazy. And I worry that it will worsen. It’s… unsettling not to be able to recall things. I want to be sure my wishes are known, should I become… incapable of expressing them.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, memory lapses are the primary concern. And you're understandably worried about potential future decline. Can you give me some examples of these “gaps”?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult. Small things, mostly. Like… I was working on an etching just last week, a landscape, and I know I finished it… but I can’t recall the specific details of the design. Or… I went to the market on Tuesday, I believe, and I bought apples, but I can't remember which kind. Silly things, really. But then… sometimes it’s larger. Like appointments. I rely heavily on reminders, and even then… It’s… frustrating. And a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Right. So, primarily recent memory issues. And you've noticed this is impacting your daily life – forgetting details of tasks, appointments… It sounds like typical age-related forgetfulness, honestly. Most people experience some cognitive slowing as they get older. But we should rule out anything more serious, of course. Let me pull up your EHR… height and weight are listed as 183cm and 123lbs. Anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Age-related…? I… I suppose. But it feels… more pronounced than what I’ve heard others experience. And I’m only thirty-five. As for my height and weight… no, nothing has changed recently. Those measurements are accurate, I believe. I… I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, despite everything. It's just… difficult to focus when you can’t rely on your own mind.
DOCTOR: Thirty-five is still young, yes. But stress, anxiety, even dietary factors can contribute to cognitive issues. We'll need to run some baseline tests, just to be thorough. I'm thinking a basic neurological exam, and some cognitive screening tests. And blood work to check for any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. I’ll order those now. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible. I appreciate you taking this seriously. Allergies… hmm. No, not that I am aware of. I haven’t had a reaction to anything in… a very long time. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to certain pollens, but nothing severe. I’ve always been quite… robust, health-wise. Until recently, of course. Do you think these tests will help determine… what’s happening?
DOCTOR: They will give us a starting point, Ms. Buoniconti. A baseline. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to be certain. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… That’s… difficult to recall. I believe I used to take something for mild anxiety, a few years ago, but I stopped… I can’t quite remember the name. It was prescribed by my previous doctor, in… in the city. I haven’t taken anything regularly for quite some time, though. Just occasional over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, perhaps. Nothing significant. I apologize for my… lack of clarity. It’s truly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. So, discontinued anxiety medication, occasional pain relievers. It’s good you’re trying to recall, but these details are important. We need a complete list, if possible. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. It’s just… so long ago. And everything feels… hazy. Surgeries… I believe… I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, of course. And… There was something else, years ago. A minor procedure on my hand, related to my work… an etching injury, I think? A small cut that required stitches. But that was… decades ago. I truly apologize for my inability to provide more specific information. My memory is… simply not what it used to be. Is this… concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Ms. Buoniconti. But we’ll proceed as best we can. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My mother’s side… I didn’t know them very well. She… she emigrated from Mongolia when I was very young. And I lost contact with most of my relatives. I believe my grandmother… She was… unwell in her later years. Something… with her mind. But I was very young, and the details are… vague. I’m afraid I can’t provide much information. It’s… a sensitive topic. And my memory… I apologize for being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history, then. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned before. I do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. Never have. I am a dedicated artist, and I require a clear mind for my work. I find that question… rather presumptuous, with all due respect. Is that impacting your assessment? My inability to recall specific details, and not… lifestyle choices?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Buoniconti. We need a complete picture. Now, let’s focus on your current situation. What is your occupation?
PATIENT: As I mentioned previously, I am an etcher and engraver. I create detailed artwork, primarily landscapes and portraits. It requires a great deal of focus and precision. I work from my home studio, mostly. It’s… a solitary profession, but I find it very rewarding. At least, I did. It’s becoming… increasingly difficult to concentrate, as you know. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any support system?
PATIENT: Support system…? I… I am divorced. My ex-husband… we are not in contact. And I… I don’t have any close family nearby. I have a few acquaintances, fellow artists, but… It’s mostly… solitude. I manage on my own, but… it can be isolating. I apologize for being so… bleak.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Buoniconti, based on what you’ve told me, you’re experiencing some memory lapses and difficulty concentrating. It’s good you’re proactive about getting this checked out. I'm going to perform a basic neurological exam and order some cognitive screening tests and blood work, as previously mentioned. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Please follow me. We’ll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I… I appreciate your thoroughness. Please, don’t hesitate to explain anything I don’t understand. My memory… as you know, it's not always reliable.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just sit here, and I'll begin. First, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? August… August… the second…? Yes, I believe it is August the second. 2025, isn’t it? Is that correct? I… I’m not entirely certain. It feels… distant.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Is that correct? I… I believe I have them. But it required a great deal of concentration. It feels… fragile. Like they could easily slip away.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about your orientation. What city are we in?
PATIENT: What city…? That’s… a difficult question. I believe… a rural area? I don’t… I don’t recall the specific name. I traveled quite a distance to get here, and I wasn't paying attention to the details. It’s… embarrassing. I truly apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: The year…? Oh dear… Is it… 2024? No… 2023? I… I’m not certain. It feels… distant. Like a fog. I apologize. My memory is… simply not what it used to be. I am terribly embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It appears you are experiencing some significant cognitive impairment. Based on these preliminary findings, I suspect you may be experiencing early stages of dementia. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. I’m going to order a full blood panel, a brain MRI, and a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Dementia…? No… that’s… impossible. I… I’m only thirty-five. There must be a mistake. I… I just have a bad memory. It’s been stressful… A brain MRI…? A neurologist…? Oh dear… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I understand this is unsettling news, but it’s important to get a proper diagnosis. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have dementia, but we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your cognitive impairment. The MRI will help us rule out any structural abnormalities in your brain, and the neurologist will conduct a more thorough neurological exam and cognitive testing. I'm going to schedule these tests for you immediately. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid driving or making any major decisions until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. Do you have someone who can accompany you to these appointments and assist you with transportation?
