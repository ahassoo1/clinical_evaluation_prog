DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, just... a cough. Been coughin’ up some stuff. Not good stuff. Like... red in it. Been happenin’ a bit. I smoke, you know. Always have. Don’t remember exactly when it started, though. A while, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. A cough with some red in the mucus… and you’ve been a smoker for a long time. I understand. When you say “a while,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough... geez. Since I was… young, I think. Maybe… forty years? Something like that. It's hard to say, really. I don’t keep track of things like that. It’s always been… just part of life, you know? A cigarette with coffee, and… well, you get it. Is it bad? Is that why I’m here?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re getting it checked out, Mr. Reyno. Forty years of smoking is significant, and a cough with red mucus does need to be investigated. We need to figure out what’s causing it. Okay, I see you’ve had Medicare for a while, and this is a rural clinic visit... Good. First, let's talk about the cough itself. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. More when I… move around, I guess. Or when it’s cold. Not all the time, though. Sometimes I forget I even have it, then I take a deep breath and… there it is. It's a dry cough mostly. Not much… phlegm, except for… the red stuff. That happens every now and then. Not every cough, just… sometimes. It’s kinda scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, worse with activity or cold air, and generally dry, but with occasional red-tinged mucus. That’s helpful. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Uh… …I get tired easier, I think. But I’m… older. So that could just be… old age. No fever, I don’t think. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but again, could be… everything. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. Does it matter? Is somethin’ wrong wrong?
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me all of this, Mr. Reyno. Fatigue and shortness of breath do matter, even if you think they’re just from getting older. We need to rule things out. Okay. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? … I don’t know. I haven’t been weighin’ myself. Maybe a little? My clothes… feel a little looser, maybe. But I haven't really noticed. I eat okay, I guess. Not like I used to, but… enough. Is that bad too? Everything seems to be bad.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Reyno, but it's information we need to consider. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask about some other things, just to get a complete picture. Have you had any chest pain, or any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not really. Sometimes a little… tight, maybe. But it comes and goes. Like indigestion, you know? Swelling… no, not that I’ve noticed. My ankles… I wear boots most of the time, so I wouldn’t see it, would I? This is a lot of questions. Can we… get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand you want to get this over with, Mr. Reyno, and we will. Just a few more questions, then I’ll do a quick exam. Have you ever had tuberculosis, or been exposed to anyone with tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Tuberculosis…? … Geez. That was… a long time ago. When I was a kid, I think. Maybe. They tested us at school, I remember that. I don’t think I had it, but… I don’t know. Everything’s kinda blurry. No, I haven’t been around anyone with it, not that I know of. We don’t… mingle much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, Mr. Reyno, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: … Not that I know of. Never really paid attention. The doctor gives me somethin’, I take it. Never had a bad reaction, as far as I remember. Maybe… a little stomach upset sometimes, but nothin’ serious. I don't take much medication. Mostly just… stuff for my arthritis. Is that it? Can we… get to the exam now? I feel kinda dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno, that’s all the questions for now. I want to listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look in your ears. Then I'll check your oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter. It will just take a few minutes. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just… hurry, please. I ain’t feelin’ so good. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not terribly concerning given your history. I’m hearing some… wheezing in your lungs, and some diminished breath sounds, particularly on the lower right side. Your heart sounds are a little muffled, but regular. Your ears look clear. Now, given your smoking history, the cough with red mucus, the wheezing, and the diminished breath sounds, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or, we need to rule this out, a lung mass. It’s also possible it's pneumonia. I’m going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also want to order a sputum culture to see if there’s any infection present. Would you be able to cough up some mucus for that test?
PATIENT: A lung… mass? …Is that… bad? Really bad? I don't wanna die. Can’t I just… stop smokin’? Will that fix it? Sputum… coughin’ up stuff? I can try. It ain't easy, though. I mostly just hack. Just tell me… is it gonna hurt? Is it cancer?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, please try to stay calm. A lung mass can be serious, but it doesn’t automatically mean cancer. It could be many things, and we won't know until we get the X-ray results. Stopping smoking is absolutely the best thing you can do for your health, and it will help, no matter what the cause of your symptoms is. The sputum culture will just involve coughing deeply into this cup. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt. The technician will give you instructions on how to do it properly. I'm also going to order a blood test to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection. I want to rule out everything possible before we decide on a treatment plan. I'm sending the orders to the lab now. The X-ray and blood test can be done here at the clinic. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning. The sputum culture you'll do at home. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Tomorrow…? …Can’t I just… get somethin’ for the cough? Somethin’ to stop it? I don’t wanna wait. And… coughin’ up stuff… what if I can’t? What if I just… dry cough? This is… a lot. Is there anyone I can call? My daughter… she lives in town. I just… want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand you're feeling overwhelmed, and it's okay to feel that way. I wish I could just give you something to make the cough go away, but it's important to find out why you’re coughing before we start treatment. Giving you medication without knowing the cause could actually make things worse. I've written down the instructions for the sputum culture on this paper, just in case you forget. And if you can only dry cough, that's okay. We can still send the sample for analysis, and we'll work with what we have. You absolutely can call your daughter. Here’s the number for the clinic, and I can also write down my direct line if you want to call with any questions before tomorrow. I’m going to have the nurse check your oxygen levels again before you leave, and if they’re low, we can give you some supplemental oxygen. We want to make sure you’re comfortable. I know waiting for the results is difficult, but we’re going to get this figured out. Would you like me to call your daughter for you now?
PATIENT: …No. No, I can call her. I just… want to go home. Please. Get me outta here. I’ll… I’ll try to cough up somethin’. I will. Just… don’t tell me it’s cancer, okay? Don't say that word. Just let me go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Reyno. I won't say that word. I understand you want to go home, and I'm going to make sure you're comfortable enough to do so. Nurse, could you please come in here for a moment?
