DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I received a letter about getting certified for home health… or maybe hospice care? Honestly, I wasn't entirely sure what it was about, but it said to come in for an assessment, so here I am. I’m Calin Sachar, by the way.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sachar. It's good to have that clarification. It sounds like someone may have proactively reached out regarding potential home health services, and perhaps there was some confusion about the specific reason. We can definitely sort that out today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I work as a presser, you know, in textiles. It's pretty physical work, standing all day and using my hands a lot. Lately, I’ve been getting really tired, even after a full night’s sleep. And my hands… they ache something awful. It’s making it harder to do my job, to be honest. I’ve also been feeling a little short of breath sometimes, just with regular activity. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tiredness, hand aches, and shortness of breath – those are all important things to discuss. So, the fatigue… has that been a gradual onset, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It’s been… gradual, I think. It didn’t just happen overnight. Maybe over the last six months or so, I’ve just been feeling more and more drained. At first, I thought it was just the stress of work, you know? Things have been busy. But it’s not getting any better, even when things slow down a bit. It’s just… constant now, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Constant fatigue, even with rest, is definitely something we need to investigate. And you mentioned the hand aches – where exactly are you feeling the pain in your hands?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my wrists and the base of my fingers, Doctor. And sometimes it goes up my forearms. It’s a dull ache, mostly, but when I’m actually working – pressing clothes all day – it gets sharp, like a burning feeling. I try to take breaks, but it doesn’t always help. It's just… uncomfortable. And lately, it’s been making it hard to grip things properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Wrist and base of fingers, radiating up the forearm, dull ache that sharpens with activity… sounds like we should take a closer look at that. Now, going back to the shortness of breath – can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m gasping for air or anything, Doctor. It’s more like… I get winded really easily. Like, if I walk up a flight of stairs, or even just walk quickly to the bus stop, I find myself needing to stop and catch my breath. It didn’t used to be like that. And sometimes, even when I’m just sitting down, I feel like I can’t take a full, deep breath. It's a little frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand why that would be frightening, Ms. Sachar. It’s good that you're bringing this to our attention. To get a better picture of what's going on, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and also do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? I'm a bit worried, but I’m glad I came in. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sachar. Just breathe normally. I’m listening to your heart now… everything sounds regular, good rate and rhythm. Now, your lungs… take a deep breath for me… and exhale… again… good. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can detect at the moment. Now, your wrists… there’s some mild tenderness on both sides, particularly on the thumb side. And I notice some slight swelling in the knuckles of your hands. Can you squeeze my hand for me?
PATIENT: Okay… there. It’s a little painful, actually. Especially when I put any force into it. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a deep ache, like it’s all stiff. And I can feel it… it’s uncomfortable even after I let go. It feels… constricted, I guess is the word. I haven’t said anything to anyone about this yet, to be honest. Just trying to push through it.
DOCTOR: I see. That constriction and pain with grip is significant. Alright, Ms. Sachar. I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do. Ask whatever you need to. I’ll try my best to answer. I don’t have a lot of experience with doctors, so bear with me.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ms. Sachar. We’ll take it slow. First, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to. I eat pretty much everything. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. I’ve never had to worry about allergies or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to just tough things out, honestly. I take some vitamins occasionally, but that’s about it. Just a multivitamin, nothing regular. I usually only take it when I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, of course, but never anything serious. My doctor back home… well, I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in a while. That’s part of why I’m here, I guess. I just… things have been busy, and I haven’t gotten around to it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've been lucky enough to avoid all of that, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I suppose, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, nothing. I’m usually pretty careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. In her hands, mostly. It got pretty bad towards the end. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. But other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. We weren't very close, to be honest. I don’t have a lot of information. It’s sad, really.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Sachar. It's common to not have a full picture of family medical history. Alright. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, as I said, I work as a presser, so I'm on my feet all day. It’s pretty physical work. I live alone, in a small apartment. I don’t really have much time for hobbies, to be honest. Mostly I just come home and rest. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re tired all the time. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much. I used to go dancing sometimes, but I haven't been in a while. Things have just… slowed down. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good sense of things, Ms. Sachar. Thank you. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Given the fatigue, hand aches, and shortness of breath, combined with the swelling and tenderness in your hands, it could be something like early signs of rheumatoid arthritis, or potentially a repetitive stress injury, but we need more information. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for inflammation markers, and also possibly an X-ray of your hands to look for any joint damage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's going on, and what I can do about it. Blood tests and an X-ray… alright. Will I need a referral for the X-ray? And… will the blood tests be covered by insurance? I don't have any insurance, unfortunately. I've been meaning to get some, but… it's complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, you will need a referral for the X-ray, and I can arrange that for you. As for the blood tests, unfortunately, without insurance, there will be a cost. I can give you a list of local labs and their pricing so you can compare. We also have some resources here at the clinic that may be able to assist with financial assistance for lab work. We can explore those options together if you'd like. In the meantime, I recommend you try to avoid activities that aggravate your hand pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage the discomfort, but please follow the instructions on the label carefully. Are you allergic to NSAIDs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not allergic to those. I’ve taken ibuprofen before, for headaches, and it’s been fine. I can try to take it easy with my hands, and I’ll see if I can get some financial assistance for the blood tests. This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I just… I just want to feel better. Do you think it could be serious? I’m a bit worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Sachar, and it's completely valid. It’s good you came in. It could be serious, but it’s also very likely to be something manageable. It's too early to say definitively without the test results. We're just gathering information at this point. The blood tests will help us rule out certain conditions and identify any inflammation. The X-ray will allow us to see if there's any damage to the joints in your hands. Once we have those results, we can discuss the best course of action. I'll write you the referral for the X-ray and the lab order. I'll also provide you with information about the clinic's financial assistance programs. Is there anyone you’d like me to contact if there are any issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have anyone. I'm on my own, mostly. But thank you for offering. I’ll try to get the tests done as soon as I can. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little less scared, to be honest. Is there anything else I need to do right now? Or can I go?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sachar. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. No, there’s nothing else you need to do right now. Just schedule the X-ray and blood tests at your convenience. The lab results will typically take a few days to come back, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. Here is the referral and lab order, as well as the information about the financial assistance programs. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and try to rest your hands as much as possible. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment. If you develop any new symptoms, or if your existing symptoms worsen significantly, please contact us immediately. .
