DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Redeye, good morning. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Been going on for two days now, at least. It’s really quite annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Two days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, started…let me think… Tuesday afternoon, I believe. After I was setting up for the karaoke night at The Rusty Mug. I had a bit of a laugh with Old Man Hemlock about his singing, and then boom, started hiccuping. Usually, they go away pretty quick, you know? But not these ones.
DOCTOR: Right, karaoke night… and a good laugh. Hmm. And have you tried anything to get rid of them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, all sorts of things! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down…that didn't work. My niece told me to eat a spoonful of sugar, that’s a silly one. And I even asked my ex-husband for advice, can you believe it? He said to scare myself, which…didn’t help either. Nothing’s touched them. That’s why I’m here, really. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Well, that's certainly a thorough attempt. You've tried the usual remedies, it seems. Alright, let’s get a little more information. Besides the hiccups themselves, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… No fever, I don't think. No chest pain. A little bit of heartburn, now that I think about it, but I get that sometimes anyway, especially after a long day and a spicy meal. And I'm a little tired, but honestly, who isn't these days? Nothing major, I promise. Just…hiccups. Constant, bothersome hiccups.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn and a little tiredness noted. Do you have any difficulty breathing, or any pain when you swallow?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Breathing is fine. Swallowing is…normal, I guess? It doesn't hurt or anything. It's just…the hiccups interrupt everything! Makes it hard to talk, hard to eat…it’s a nuisance, truly. It feels like something is just…catching in my throat with each one, but not painful. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick listen to your chest and take a look at your throat, just to rule out anything obvious. Can you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to stick my tongue out or anything. I'm happy to cooperate. It's just… please be quick? These things are driving me mad!
DOCTOR: Alright. Your throat looks… perfectly normal. No redness, no swelling. Everything appears quite healthy. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Lungs are clear on both sides. No wheezing, no crackles. Heart sounds regular. Everything sounds alright, Ms. Redeye. It's… perplexing.
PATIENT: Perplexing? That’s…not very reassuring, Doctor. So, you can't find anything wrong? Is it…stress, do you think? I have been a bit run-down lately, trying to keep The Rusty Mug afloat. It’s harder work than people realize.
DOCTOR: Well, stress can certainly manifest in… unusual ways. And running a business is undoubtedly stressful. However, two days of persistent hiccups without any other symptoms…it’s not typical for just stress. It could be a minor irritation of the phrenic nerve – that’s the nerve that controls your diaphragm. Sometimes those can resolve on their own. Have you had any recent changes in medication?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question! No, no changes in medication. I take a little something for my blood pressure, that's all. Been on the same dose for years, though. And I haven't started any new vitamins or anything like that either. I really haven't changed anything in my routine, except for…well, setting up the karaoke, I guess. Could it be something I ate? I did have a rather large plate of falafel from that new place downtown.
DOCTOR: Falafel, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! That place, "Layla's Delights". It was very tasty, but…maybe something wasn't quite fresh? It's just a thought. I'm trying to recall if anyone else who ate there seemed unwell, but I haven’t heard anything. It was busy, so I didn’t really get a chance to ask around.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it’s possible something didn’t agree with you. A mild gastrointestinal upset could irritate the phrenic nerve, causing hiccups. It’s difficult to say for certain. We could order some blood work to rule out other possibilities, but given your otherwise normal exam and the lack of other symptoms, I’m inclined to think this will resolve on its own. I'm going to recommend a bland diet for the next few days – rice, toast, bananas. Avoid spicy foods and carbonated drinks. And continue to hydrate. If the hiccups persist for more than a week, then we’ll revisit this and consider further investigation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… sounds quite sensible, Doctor. Bland diet, no spice, plenty of fluids. I can manage that, I suppose. Although, rice and toast for a week doesn’t sound terribly exciting. But if it stops the hiccups, I'm willing to try. A week, you say? And then we’ll think about blood work? Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s just… they’re so annoying! I’m hoping they go away quickly. .
DOCTOR: Yes, well, sometimes these things just… happen. They are often more of a nuisance than a serious medical issue. I'll write down these instructions for you. Come back if they persist beyond a week. In the meantime, try to relax, Ms. Redeye. And perhaps reconsider the karaoke nights for now. Now, is there anything else bothering you today?
