DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’m here today regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the masks they’re asking us to wear. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps an alternative.
DOCTOR: Alright, an issue with the masks at work… and you're looking at potential exemption or alternatives. I understand. Before we dive into that, could you tell me a bit more about why you’re seeking an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to explain, truthfully. It’s not a matter of discomfort, not exactly. It’s more… a feeling. A tightness in my chest, a bit of trouble breathing when I have something covering my face for too long. It reminds me… of things best left in the past. It causes a bit of distress, a panic, almost. I've tried explaining it to my supervisor, but I don’t believe they fully understand. It’s a… cultural sensitivity, I suppose. A personal thing, tied to my heritage. I apologize if that sounds… vague. It’s hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: No, not at all vague, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. It sounds like this is connected to some difficult experiences, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. A tightness in the chest, trouble breathing, feelings of panic when wearing a mask…and a connection to your heritage. That's important information. Just to be clear, does this feeling happen every time you wear a mask, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: It happens every time, Doctor. Without fail. Even a simple cloth mask, for even a short period. It doesn’t matter the material or how loose it is. It begins almost immediately – a slight pressure, and then the feeling builds. It’s… unsettling. I've tried different kinds, different fits, even attempting to acclimate myself slowly, but nothing seems to help. It truly is every single time. It’s why I’ve been hesitant to even request this exemption; I didn't want to appear… difficult, or to cause trouble for my workplace. But it’s becoming… unsustainable.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Knabenshue. That sounds incredibly distressing, and I commend you for trying to manage this on your own. The fact that it happens every time, regardless of the mask, is significant. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you experienced anything like this before the current mask mandates?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. And… a difficult one to answer. It’s… no, not exactly like this. I've always been a bit sensitive to confinement, I suppose. Growing up… well, there were restrictions placed upon my people, naturally. Things weren't always freely given. But this feeling… this specific anxiety connected to covering my face… it began with the initial mandates, and has persisted since. Before that, I never experienced this level of distress. It feels… amplified, somehow. Tied to those older feelings, I suspect. A resurgence, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, this is a relatively new experience, triggered by the mask mandates, but potentially connected to past experiences of restriction. That’s very helpful. Now, have you discussed this with your primary care physician at all?
PATIENT: I haven’t, Doctor. I… I wasn't sure how to explain it to them. It feels… intangible, you see? I worried they wouldn't understand. I’m not experiencing a physical ailment, not in the traditional sense. It’s more… an emotional and spiritual distress. It felt… inappropriate to bring it up without a clear medical explanation. I thought perhaps you could offer a different perspective, someone who might understand the… complexities of it all.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s perfectly reasonable to seek someone who might be more attuned to these nuances. It sounds like this is causing you significant distress, and you're right to explore all avenues. To get a better understanding of your overall health, would you mind if I asked a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, ask whatever you need to. I will answer as truthfully as I can. I understand the importance of a full picture. I have no objections.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with this: Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I’ve always been… fortunate, in terms of physical health. I’ve never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions. I lead a fairly active life, when I’m able. I enjoy walking, and spending time outdoors. I try to maintain a healthy diet, though it can be difficult at times. My blood pressure is generally good, and I’ve never had any issues with my heart or lungs. I had a routine check-up last year, and everything came back normal.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid any need for surgical intervention. I’ve broken a bone or two as a child – a typical boyish mishap – but nothing that required a hospital stay or surgery. I pride myself on being… resilient, I suppose. I've always been able to heal quickly and recover well. I have a strong constitution, and I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not. I avoid medications whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if I need something. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just to supplement my diet, but that’s the extent of it. I don’t have any allergies to medications, and I’ve never experienced any adverse reactions to anything. I believe in keeping my body as natural as possible, and avoiding anything that could disrupt its balance. I find that a healthy diet and regular exercise are the best medicine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a… complicated question, Doctor. My family history is… fragmented, in a way. There were many losses, many disruptions. Record-keeping wasn't always prioritized, you understand. But to the best of my knowledge, there wasn't a strong prevalence of chronic illnesses. Heart disease, perhaps, in some older relatives, but that’s fairly common. There were no instances of hereditary conditions or mental illness, to my knowledge. My mother was a strong woman, and she lived a long and healthy life. My father… well, his history is largely unknown. There were… circumstances. But I don’t believe there were any significant hereditary concerns. It’s difficult to say for certain, given the… gaps in our family history.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s alright if the information is incomplete. Now, have you experienced any significant psychological or psychiatric issues in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve always been… emotionally stable, I believe. I’ve faced challenges, certainly, as everyone does. But I’ve always been able to cope with stress and adversity. I’ve never been diagnosed with any mental health conditions, and I’ve never sought therapy or counseling. I have a strong support system – my community, my friends – and I find that talking to them is enough to help me through difficult times. I’m a private person, naturally, but I’m not afraid to ask for help when I need it. I believe in resilience, and I’m proud of my ability to overcome challenges. I'm a bit of a stoic, perhaps. I don't dwell on things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. Now, just a couple of final questions. Do you have any allergies to anything – food, environmental factors, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions to anything. I can eat anything, and I’m not sensitive to any environmental factors. I’ve spent a lot of time outdoors, and I’ve never had any issues with pollen or insects. I’ve always been… fortunate in that regard. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or any other allergy medication. I’m not sensitive to any perfumes or chemicals, and I’m not prone to hives or rashes. I’m quite… robust, I suppose. A strong constitution. I rarely get sick, and I rarely have any allergic reactions. I’m quite… plain, in that regard. I don’t have any sensitivities or allergies to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. You have a remarkably clean medical history, and you seem to be a very resilient person. Now, let’s talk about what’s going on with the masks. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like this is less a physical issue and more of an emotional response, potentially linked to past trauma and a feeling of restriction. I want to be clear: your feelings are valid, and I take them very seriously. Before we discuss potential exemptions or alternatives, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to rule out any underlying physical causes for your discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… prudent. I understand the need to rule out any other possibilities. I am happy to cooperate with a physical exam. I trust your judgment, and I appreciate your thoroughness. I have nothing to hide, and I want to ensure we’re addressing this matter in the most comprehensive way possible. Please proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit on the examination table for me, please. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your breathing and overall respiratory function. It will be quick and non-invasive. Okay, everything sounds clear on both sides. Heart rate is normal and regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Respiratory rate is within normal limits. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. And exhale slowly. Good. Chest expansion is symmetrical and full. No signs of labored breathing or abnormal effort. Everything appears normal physically. This further supports the idea that this is primarily an emotional response.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, Doctor. Though I confess, I wasn’t expecting any different. I appreciate you taking the time to perform the examination nonetheless. It provides a measure of… validation, I suppose. Knowing that there isn’t a physical ailment contributing to this distress is… helpful. Now, what are my options? Regarding the exemption, or perhaps an alternative solution to wearing a mask at my workplace?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Based on everything you've shared, and the normal physical exam, I believe this falls under a category of psychological distress triggered by a specific circumstance – in this case, wearing a mask. Now, regarding exemptions… it’s… complicated. Many workplaces require documentation from a medical professional. However, simply stating “psychological distress” isn't always sufficient. They may require a more specific diagnosis, such as anxiety disorder or panic disorder. I'm hesitant to assign a diagnosis without a more thorough psychological evaluation. It wouldn't be ethical to do so. However, I can write a letter outlining your symptoms, the impact they have on your ability to perform your work duties, and my recommendation for reasonable accommodations. We can frame it as a sensitivity to the restrictive nature of masks triggering a significant emotional response, and a potential contraindication to wearing them. It’s not a guarantee of an exemption, but it's a strong starting point. Regarding alternatives… have you considered a face shield?
PATIENT: A face shield… I hadn’t thought of that. It’s… less encompassing, less restrictive. It allows for more airflow, more freedom of movement. It might… mitigate some of the distress. It's worth considering, certainly. And a letter… that sounds like the most practical course of action. Outlining my symptoms and recommending reasonable accommodations. I understand you can’t guarantee an exemption, and I don’t expect you to. Simply having documentation from a medical professional would be… invaluable. Could you perhaps phrase it in terms of a sensitivity stemming from cultural experiences, and the potential for triggering a significant emotional response? Without… detailing the specifics, of course. Just a general acknowledgement of the cultural factors involved. Would that be possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I can certainly frame it in terms of a sensitivity stemming from cultural experiences, and the potential for triggering a significant emotional response. I'll avoid detailing specifics, respecting your privacy. I can also emphasize the impact of this distress on your ability to perform your work duties effectively, and recommend a trial period with a reasonable accommodation, such as a face shield, to assess its effectiveness. I also want to recommend that you consider speaking with a mental health professional. A therapist or counselor could provide you with coping mechanisms and strategies to manage your anxiety and distress, and potentially provide additional documentation to support your exemption request. Would you like me to provide you with a list of local mental health resources?
PATIENT: That sounds… excellent, Doctor. A letter outlining my symptoms, acknowledging the cultural factors, and recommending a trial period with a face shield. That's precisely what I was hoping for. And yes, please. A list of local mental health resources would be greatly appreciated. I… I haven't actively sought therapy in the past, but I understand the benefits of having a professional to speak with. It might be… helpful to explore those options. Thank you for the suggestion. Is there anything else you recommend, or anything I should be aware of before pursuing this matter with my workplace?
DOCTOR: Here’s the letter, Mr. Knabenshue. Please review it and let me know if you’d like any changes. As for additional recommendations… be prepared to advocate for yourself. Many workplaces are unfamiliar with these types of sensitivities, and you may need to educate them about the impact of this distress. Be calm, professional, and focus on the impact it has on your work performance. Document everything – your requests, their responses, any accommodations made or denied. Also, understand your rights. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may be a useful resource if you encounter discrimination or unreasonable denial of accommodations. I can provide you with a link to their website as well. Finally, remember to prioritize your well-being. This can be a stressful process, and it's important to take care of yourself. Here’s a list of local mental health resources and the link to the EEOC website. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. This has been… immensely helpful. I truly appreciate your thoroughness, your understanding, and your willingness to advocate for my well-being. You've provided me with a solid foundation to pursue this matter with my workplace, and I feel much more confident moving forward. Thank you, again, for everything. I will review the documentation carefully, and reach out if I have any further questions. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. And remember to prioritize your well-being. Take care of yourself. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best in navigating this situation.
