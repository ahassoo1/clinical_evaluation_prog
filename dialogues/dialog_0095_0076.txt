DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re really bothering me, especially when I walk. They’re on my shins, both of ‘em. Red and kinda hard, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins, both of them, red and hard… and they bother you when you walk. Alright. How long have you noticed these bumps, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… maybe… a couple of months now? It started with just one, I think, and then more kept showing up. Not all at once, slowly, you know? It’s hard to say exactly how long, Doc. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, a couple of months, starting with one and gradually more appearing. That’s helpful. And have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps, definitely. When I sit down and put my feet up, it doesn’t hurt as much. But… working, that’s when they really flare up. All that walking and being on my feet all day. I do a lot of lifting too, at work, moving boxes and stuff. I don’t know if that has anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting improves it, and work – particularly walking, standing, and lifting – makes it worse. That gives us a good starting point. Do you recall any injury to your legs that might have started this?
PATIENT: Injury? Hmm… not that I remember, Doc. I bump my legs sometimes at work, you know, running into things with all the boxes, but nothing serious. No big falls or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty careful. I can’t think of anything that would have caused it, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant injury that you recall. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think… sometimes my legs feel kinda itchy around the bumps, but not all the time. And… they feel warm, too. Not feverish warm, but warmer than the rest of my skin, you know? That’s about it, I think. No swelling, no pus or anything like that. Just bumps, itchiness, and warmth.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchiness and warmth around the bumps. I’m going to take a look at your legs now, if that’s alright with you. Just need to examine them. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doc. Go ahead. Just let me know if I need to move or anything. I’m a little ticklish, though!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the bumps here on both shins. They are firm to the touch, and I do notice some warmth compared to the rest of your skin. There’s a bit of redness around them as well. No swelling or open sores at this time. Are these bumps painful to the touch, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Yes, they are, Doc. Not like a sharp pain, but a dull ache, especially when you press on ‘em. It’s kinda like a bruise, you know? And they feel… hard. Real hard. Like little stones under the skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache with palpation, feeling hard like stones. That helps. Now, have you had any changes in your weight recently, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Not really, Doc. I think I’ve stayed pretty much the same. Maybe lost a pound or two, but nothing major. I eat about the same as always, and I’m always on my feet at work, so… no big changes there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant weight change. And just to get a complete picture, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife handles most of that stuff, you know? I go to the doctor when she tells me to. I think… I think I have high blood pressure, but I take medicine for it. And… I think the doctor said something about my cholesterol being a little high, too. Other than that… I don't think so. My wife will probably know better.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, managed with medication. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me see… sometimes I take something for my heartburn, when it flares up. Just an over-the-counter thing, you know, like Tums. And… sometimes ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. That’s about it, Doc. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tums as needed for heartburn and ibuprofen occasionally for aches and pains. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doc. My wife always asks me that when I go to the doctor, and I always tell her no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever I want, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doc. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And… definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drug use. Alright, Mr. Aluia, thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you might have shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome. The bumps and pain on your shins, especially with activity, and your history of lifting and being on your feet a lot, are consistent with that diagnosis. However, to rule out other possibilities, like a stress fracture or a circulation problem, I’d like to order some blood tests. We'll check your inflammatory markers and basic blood counts. And I would like to get an x-ray of your shins, just to be sure. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an x-ray, huh? That sounds… thorough, Doc. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, that’s alright with me. I just want to get this pain figured out. It’s really bothering me when I work, and I don’t want it to get worse. When can we do those tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I understand wanting to get this addressed. We can do the blood tests right here in the clinic today. The x-ray, we can schedule that for tomorrow morning at the imaging center across the street. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds good, Doc. That’s fine with me. Across the street is convenient, too. So, blood tests today and x-ray tomorrow. Will I need to do anything special before the tests, like fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the blood tests, I'd like you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. And for the x-ray, no special preparation is needed. Just wear comfortable clothing. In the meantime, I recommend that you rest as much as possible, avoid any strenuous activity, and apply ice packs to your shins for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible and discuss them with you then. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doc. Fast for the blood tests, rest, ice packs… I can do that. I’ll try to take it easy, but it’s hard when I have to work, you know? But I’ll do my best. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you looking into this for me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I understand it’s not easy, especially with work. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Alright, I’m going to write up the orders for the blood tests and the x-ray. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for scheduling the x-ray. Do you have any other questions for me before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doc. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I really appreciate your help. I’ll see the nurse now, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will be right with you. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening pain, swelling, or fever. Take care, Mr. Aluia. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doc. I will. Thank you. Take care too.
