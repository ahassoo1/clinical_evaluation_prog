DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit awkward to discuss, truthfully. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In the, um, groin area. It’s been on and off for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me. I apologize for being so vague; it's difficult to explain, and frankly, I don’t remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: "Groin pain," you say. Alright. It's perfectly alright to be uncomfortable discussing these things, Ms. Stepro. We're here to figure out what's going on. “On and off” is a start, but could you tell me a little more about how it feels?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring. Um, let me see. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels like a heavy pressure. And it seems to radiate, a little, down into my… well, towards my leg. It's worse after I've been on my feet a lot, you know, working with the wood. But even when I’m resting, it’s sometimes just… there. It’s hard to describe. I don't know if that helps?
DOCTOR: A dull ache with pressure, radiating down the leg, worse with activity… yes, that is helpful, thank you. You mentioned working with wood. What kind of work do you do, Ms. Stepro?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I do a little bit of everything, really. Mostly furniture repair, some small carvings… I try to keep busy. It's mostly physical work, lifting and moving things, bending over… things like that. I’ve been doing it for… a long time, I suppose. Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I can’t recall precisely when I started, to be honest. But it’s a good amount of standing and bending, always. Do you think that could be it?
DOCTOR: It could be musculoskeletal, certainly. But we need to rule other things out. Have you noticed any swelling or bruising in the area?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t noticed any visible swelling, no. And bruising… not that I’m aware of. I check, sometimes, but… no, nothing like that. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just notice the discomfort. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I haven't felt anything like this before. Is it something serious? I apologize for asking so directly, but my mind is jumping to conclusions.
DOCTOR: It's good you're voicing your concerns, Ms. Stepro. It's best to be thorough. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bladder or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my… that's a rather personal question, isn’t it? Let me see… No, I don’t believe so. Everything seems to be… normal, as far as that goes. No trouble going to the bathroom, no changes in… well, you know. I’m a bit embarrassed to discuss this, but I want to be as helpful as possible. Is this… common with this type of pain? I really don’t understand what could be going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. We're trying to cover all the bases. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or unusual vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Oh… my. That is… unexpected. No, Doctor, definitely no fever or chills. And no, I haven’t noticed any unusual… discharge. I'm a single woman, you see, and… well, let’s just say I’m very aware of my body. There has been nothing like that. This is all very… unsettling, honestly. I feel rather foolish for even being here, to be perfectly frank. Is this something men usually complain about? It just feels… wrong. I hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepro, while I appreciate your… attention to detail, this line of questioning is standard procedure. It’s important to rule out various possibilities. Now, let’s move on. Have you experienced any pain during intercourse?
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor, with all due respect, that is… entirely inappropriate. I haven't… I don't have intercourse. I’m a single woman, as I mentioned, and I haven’t been with anyone for… a very long time. I find this questioning deeply offensive and frankly, rather irrelevant to the pain I’m experiencing in my… groin. I came to you for help with discomfort, not a personal interrogation. I’m beginning to regret coming here. I think perhaps I should just leave.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I apologize if my questions were… intrusive. It's simply my professional duty to explore all possibilities. Let's move on. Perhaps a physical exam will provide more clarity. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… a physical exam? Of that area? Oh dear. I… I hadn’t anticipated that. I suppose… if it’s necessary. But please, Doctor, be gentle. And… explain everything as you go. I’m very nervous, as you can imagine. I really wish you hadn’t asked those previous questions. It’s all rather… humiliating. But if it will help determine what's wrong, then yes. But please, be as quick and discreet as possible. I don't know if I can handle much more of this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the table. I’ll need to examine your abdomen and then, yes, the pelvic area. I’ll explain each step as I go. It will be a quick examination, Ms. Stepro. Just relax as best you can. Now, I'm going to start by palpating your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please… be gentle. My memory isn’t the best, you see, and I don’t handle pain very well. I'm… apprehensive, to say the least. I will try to relax, but it's difficult. Please, just… tell me what you are doing as you go. And if I flinch, please don’t take offense. It's just… a nervous reaction. I hope this won’t take long. I feel very vulnerable at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just palpating your abdomen, checking for any areas of tenderness. Breathe normally, Ms. Stepro. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. A little. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache. Like a pressure. It's… uncomfortable. Is that normal? I'm not sure if that's the pain I came here about, or just… general discomfort. It's difficult to pinpoint. Please, just tell me what you're looking for. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Now, I’m going to need to examine the pelvic area. This will involve an external examination, and then a brief internal examination, if you’re comfortable with that. I understand this may be uncomfortable, and we can stop at any time. Just let me know. We’re checking for any abnormalities, masses, or sources of pain. I'll use a lubricant to make it more comfortable. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. An internal examination? I… I hadn’t realized. I’m not sure I can… I’m very uncomfortable with this. I came here for a simple pain, not… this. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we not just… take some tests? Or a scan, perhaps? I’m feeling quite faint, to be honest. I truly don’t think I can go through with this. This is all too much. I wish I hadn't come. I apologize for being difficult, but… this is deeply upsetting. I think I need a moment.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepro, a physical examination is crucial for proper diagnosis. I understand your discomfort, but without it, I cannot determine the cause of your pain. While scans and tests are helpful, they are not always conclusive. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. However, if you absolutely refuse, we can proceed with some preliminary blood work and schedule a scan. But please understand that this will significantly delay a diagnosis. Now, please lie back down. We’ll take it slowly.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. But please… be quick. And gentle. I truly… I truly don't know what I'm doing. And… explain everything as you go. I just… I just want this to be over. I apologize for being so… difficult. But I'm very frightened. And… please, don’t say anything. Just… do what you need to do. I'm ready, I suppose. But please… be gentle.
