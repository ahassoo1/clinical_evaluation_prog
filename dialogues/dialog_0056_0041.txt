DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Astore, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is good to meet you too. Well, it's… my strength, you see. It’s been going down, little by little. Not fast, but… noticeable. It makes things hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’ve noticed a gradual decrease in your strength. And it's making everyday things more difficult. Can you tell me a bit more about how it’s making things hard?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Little by little. It’s… like lifting things, you know? Groceries, even my grandchildren. I don’t want to hurt them if I drop them, but my hands… they don't feel as strong as they used to. And walking… longer walks are harder now. I get tired quicker. It's just… not like before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s impacting your ability to lift things, and your endurance with walking. That’s helpful to know. Has this been happening suddenly, or has it really been a slow process over time?
PATIENT: Slow, Doctor. Very slow. I think… maybe a year now? Hard to say exactly. It's not like I woke up one day and couldn't lift things. Just… less and less easy, over many months. I didn’t think much of it at first, just getting older, you know? But it kept going.
DOCTOR: Right, a gradual onset over the past year. That’s good information. Have you noticed any pain with lifting, or does it just feel like weakness?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. Just… heavy. Like trying to lift something very, very heavy, even if it isn't. And sometimes… a little shaky. My hands will tremble if I try to hold something for too long. Not always, but sometimes. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, just a feeling of heaviness and occasional tremors with holding things. And your wife has noticed it as well. That’s good she’s keeping an eye on things. Now, have you noticed any weakness in other parts of your body besides your arms and hands?
PATIENT: Yes, my legs too, a little. Not so bad as my arms, but… when I walk for a while, they feel tired. And sometimes, I stumble a little. Not fall, but… wobbly. It scares my wife even more, that. She says I need to come see a doctor. She is a good woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, so weakness in your legs as well, and some unsteadiness when walking. It's good your wife is encouraging you to get this checked out. Have you had any falls recently, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no falls. Just… close to it, maybe twice in the last few months. I catch myself. My wife helps, too. She’s always there to steady me. But… it makes me nervous to walk without her. It's not like me, you know? I used to be very strong. Used to train athletes, even. Now… it's different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no actual falls, just some near misses. And you used to be quite active, training athletes. That's helpful background. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had a problem with my nerves a long time ago. Years and years ago. The doctor said it was… something with the covering on the nerves. I don't remember the name. I had some trouble walking then too, but it got better with medicine. That was… maybe fifteen years ago? And I have high blood pressure, but the doctor has medicine for that. I take it every day. Other than that… just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of nerve issues about fifteen years ago, and high blood pressure which is currently managed with medication. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife handles most of that now. She keeps track of everything. I believe… it's a small white pill. And… it starts with an “A”? I am sorry, Doctor. My memory is not what it used to be. She will know for sure. She has a list at home.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Astore. Don't worry about it at all. We can always double-check with your wife or get the information from your pharmacy. Now, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the white pill for the pressure. I don’t like taking too many pills, if I can help it. My wife gives me some vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them half the time. She says I need them for my bones, but… I don’t pay much attention to that.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication. And some vitamins occasionally. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most things. My wife makes good food. She watches out for me, makes sure I don't eat anything I shouldn’t. She is very careful. I am lucky to have her.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And it sounds like you have a very supportive wife. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what’s happening and… what can be done about it. I don't want to become a burden to my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/85. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so, given your history. Now, I’m going to check your pulse and listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I want to check your muscle strength and reflexes. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here you go. Not as strong as they used to be, I’m afraid. I can feel it getting weaker, little by little. My wife says I grip the steering wheel too tight sometimes, she worries I will break it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can feel that. Your grip is a bit weaker than I'd expect for someone your age. And I’m noticing some slight tremor in your hands. Now, let's check your strength in your legs. Can you lift your legs up while I gently resist?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here I go. It's harder than it looks. Feels… heavy. And a little wobbly. I have to hold onto the chair, just to be safe. My wife always says I need to be careful. She is right, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your legs are a bit weaker as well, and I’m noticing some difficulty with balance. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon with age, but it's something to note. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing progressive weakness in both your arms and legs, accompanied by some tremors and balance issues. There are a few possibilities we need to investigate further. It could be related to your previous nerve condition, or it could be something new. To help narrow down the cause, I’d like to order some blood tests and potentially an MRI of your brain and spine. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you think are best, I will do them. I just want to know what is happening, and what can be done. MRI… is that… painful? I don’t like being closed in, if that makes sense. It reminds me of being a boy, lost in the jungle... But I will do whatever you need me to do. Just tell me what to expect. And thank you, Doctor. For listening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore, that’s perfectly understandable. An MRI isn't painful at all. You lie on a table, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your body. It's a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. You won't be closed in completely, there’s a lot of space around you. We can also discuss medication to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious about it. The blood tests will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other potential causes of weakness. I’ll also write you a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in nerve and brain disorders – for a second opinion. Would you like me to schedule those appointments for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, Doctor. Not too scary. Yes, please, if you would be so kind as to schedule them for me. My wife handles the paperwork usually, but she is busy with the grandchildren this week. I don't want to bother her with it. Just… let me know when and where. And thank you again, Doctor. For being so patient. I appreciate it very much. It’s a relief to finally be getting some answers.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. I’m happy to help. I’ve scheduled you for blood work at the lab across the street on Wednesday morning at 9:00 AM. You don't need a fasting appointment. And I’ve booked you an appointment with Dr. Lee, the neurologist, for two weeks from today, on August 16th at 2:00 PM. I’ll have the lab requisition and the neurologist referral printed for you now. In the meantime, it’s important to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Try to avoid strenuous activity that makes your weakness worse. And if you experience any new symptoms, like difficulty breathing or slurred speech, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you have covered everything very thoroughly. You are a very kind and patient doctor. I feel much better now, knowing what is being done. Thank you again for your help. I will make sure my wife knows about the appointments. Perhaps she will come with me to see Dr. Lee. Yes, that would be good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore, that sounds like a good plan. I’m glad I could help. Please let my office know if you have any questions or need to reschedule. And I wish you and your wife all the best. It was a pleasure meeting you.
