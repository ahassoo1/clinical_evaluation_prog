DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s good to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, I’d rather not be here, if I’m being truthful. But my daughter insisted. She says I haven’t been myself lately. I… I just feel tired, all the time. And not in a physical way, exactly. More… inside. It's a long story, and I don't know where to begin.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a significant change in how you feel, and it’s good of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. It's perfectly alright if it’s a long story – we have time. Perhaps we can start with when you first began noticing this tiredness, or this feeling of not being yourself. Was there a specific event or timeframe when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… a specific event? That’s difficult. It wasn’t one thing, not really. It’s been… gradual. Perhaps… after the divorce? That was… oh, goodness, nearly ten years ago now. But it’s been getting worse lately, the last six months, I’d say. I used to be very active. Lifeguarding in the summers, ski patrol in the winter. Kept me busy, kept me… focused. Now… Now I mostly stay home. It’s… lonely.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Derasmo. A significant life change like a divorce can certainly have a lasting impact, even years later. And it sounds like you were very active before, which is wonderful. The change in activity level could also be contributing to how you feel. To help me understand a little better, could you describe this tiredness in more detail?
PATIENT: It's not like being physically exhausted, you understand? After a long day of lifeguarding, I’d be tired, but a good tired. This… this is a heavy tiredness. Like… a weight on my chest. And it makes everything feel… pointless. I don't want to do things. Even things I used to enjoy. It’s like the colour has gone out of life, if that makes any sense. I just… sit. And think. And mostly, I just feel sad. It's a quiet sadness, most of the time. Not… crying all the time, but just… empty.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like you're describing a loss of interest and pleasure in things you once enjoyed, accompanied by feelings of sadness and a sense of emptiness. Those are important things to share with me. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Yes. I sleep… too much. Or I lie in bed for hours, trying to sleep, and then wake up feeling even more tired than before. It’s a very frustrating cycle. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don’t eat at all. Other days I eat… comfort food, mostly. Things I shouldn’t, really. Biscuits, chocolate. It doesn’t make me feel any better, but… it distracts me, for a little while. Is this what you were hoping to hear, Doctor? It all sounds rather pathetic, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Derasmo. This is all very helpful information, and it doesn’t sound pathetic in the least. In fact, it's quite common for people experiencing emotional distress to have changes in sleep and appetite, and to turn to comfort foods. It sounds like you are very self-aware, and honest about what's happening. Now, have you been experiencing any physical symptoms along with these feelings?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Hmm… let me think. My back aches a bit, but that’s probably from getting old. And I get headaches sometimes. But I always chalked that up to stress, or the weather. Nothing… dramatic. Oh! And I've been feeling a bit… shaky. Not all the time, but occasionally. Like my hands tremble. It’s probably nothing, really. Old age catching up with me. I don’t want to bother you with all this.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the shaky hands, Ms. Derasmo – that's important. While it may be nothing, it's good to investigate. And please, don't feel like you are bothering me. My job is to listen and help determine what’s going on. To get a broader picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had pneumonia once, many years ago. And my blood pressure was a little high for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years. Apart from that… nothing serious. I’ve always been a healthy person, really. Until recently, of course. My late husband, he had diabetes. But I’ve never had any problems with that. I get regular checkups, but the doctors never found anything… wrong. It’s all rather confusing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It can be confusing, Ms. Derasmo, especially when things change without a clear explanation. Knowing about your husband’s diabetes is helpful, as there can be a genetic component. And it’s good that your blood pressure is well-controlled. Are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. A small orange one, once a day. And… sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for the headaches. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. My mother always said… well, never mind. It’s a silly old wives’ tale. I don’t like relying on medication. It never seems to solve the root of the problem, does it?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Derasmo. Many people prefer to avoid medication when possible. And it’s good you are aware of what you’re taking. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult one. My mother… she was always a worrier. Very anxious, always fretting about something or other. She never really saw a doctor about it, though. Just… accepted it as part of her personality. My father was very stoic. Never complained about anything, even when he was clearly in pain. He had heart trouble towards the end of his life. And… my brother, he had some problems with alcohol. But that’s all I can really think of. It wasn't a family that talked much about its illnesses, if you understand me. It was more of a ‘keep it to yourself’ kind of family.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Derasmo. Many families aren't open about medical history, so it's common to have limited information. Knowing about your mother's anxiety and your father’s heart trouble is helpful. Finally, I’d like to ask about your social life. Do you have many close friends or family members you see regularly?
PATIENT: Not anymore, really. My daughter visits when she can, but she's very busy with her own life. And… well, my husband passed away several years ago. We didn’t have many friends, just a few acquaintances from church. After he died… I just sort of drifted away from them. It’s easier that way, I suppose. Less to explain. I keep to myself mostly. I have the television, of course. And my garden. But it’s not the same as having someone to talk to, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it isn’t the same, Ms. Derasmo. And it sounds like you've experienced a significant amount of loss and change in recent years. Now, with your permission, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… fine. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I suppose it can't hurt. I haven’t been to a doctor in ages. I hope I’m not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: You're not trouble at all, Ms. Derasmo. It's perfectly normal to feel a little apprehensive. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright. I always worry it will be high, just because I'm at the doctor's office. It's a terrible thing, isn't it? My body always betrays me at the worst possible moment.
DOCTOR: That's very common, Ms. Derasmo – it’s called white coat hypertension. It happens to many people. Your blood pressure is 142/88 today. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so, especially considering the circumstances. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me… and again… Your heart rate is regular and a little slow, which is fine for your age. Your lungs sound clear on both sides. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It’s a little… difficult, though. My eyes aren’t what they used to be. I need reading glasses for most things.
DOCTOR: Your strength is good in all extremities, and your reflexes are normal. No signs of any focal weakness. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, Ms. Derasmo, which is reassuring. However, given your symptoms – the tiredness, loss of interest, changes in sleep and appetite, and shaky hands – I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong with me. It's just... wearing me down. Everything. I suppose blood tests are a good place to start. What sort of things will they be looking for?
DOCTOR: They’re a good place to start. We’ll be checking a complete blood count to look for any signs of anemia or infection, a thyroid panel to see if your thyroid is functioning properly, a vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. We’ll also check a B12 level. We'll also do a test to rule out any inflammation. These tests will help us to determine if there is a physical cause for your symptoms. I'll also need to ask you a few questions about your mood, which will help me to better understand what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Questions about my mood… I suppose that’s to be expected. It's just… hard to talk about. But I understand. If it will help, I'll answer them as best I can. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this. It's a standard tool that helps us assess how you've been feeling emotionally. Over the last two weeks, have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that’s very true. Nothing really appeals to me anymore. Even things I used to enjoy. It's like… the joy has gone out of everything. I just… exist. That's a good way to put it, I suppose. I just exist. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Derasmo, that answers the question. And I want to assure you, acknowledging these feelings is a sign of strength, not weakness. Next question: Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless… yes. That’s a good word for it. I don't know what the point of anything is anymore. It's not that I want to… to hurt myself, or anything like that. But I just… don't see a future for myself. It's just… grey. Everything is just grey. I suppose that sounds rather dramatic, doesn't it? I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, it doesn’t sound dramatic at all. It sounds like you’re describing a very difficult emotional state. And it's perfectly alright to feel this way. You’re not alone. Based on your symptoms and my examination, and the responses to these questions, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes first with the blood tests. I'd also like to discuss some potential treatment options with you, after we get the results back. These could include lifestyle changes, therapy, and medication. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Anything to feel… better. I’m willing to try anything, to be honest. Lifestyle changes… I suppose I could try to get out more. But it's hard. It takes so much… energy. Therapy… I don’t know. I've never really talked about my feelings with anyone. It's not something my generation did, you see. But… if it would help… yes, alright. And medication… I’m a little hesitant about that, but… if it’s necessary… yes. I just want to feel like myself again, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, that is not too much to ask at all. And you've already taken a huge step by acknowledging how you're feeling and being open to treatment. Okay. I’m going to order the blood tests now. They’ll need a sample from your arm. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be able to assist you. Once you’ve had the tests done, you can come back, and we'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available, which is usually a few days. In the meantime, I want you to know that I’m here for you. If you're feeling overwhelmed or having any difficulty coping, please don't hesitate to call the office. We can also provide you with resources for mental health support. Would you like me to give you some information about local support groups and therapists?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… helpful. Just to have something to look at, you see. I suppose I should try to be proactive about this. It’s just… a little overwhelming, to be honest. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your patience. And your kindness. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. It is a lot to take in, and you've handled it with grace. Here’s some information for you. The nurse will be right with you to draw your blood, and then you’re free to go. Remember, you're not alone in this, and we'll work through this together. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. And please, take care of yourself. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again. I suppose I should go and get this blood test done. I’ll… see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse is just outside. Please let me know if you need anything at all. I'll see you in a few days, Ms. Derasmo. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you then. .
