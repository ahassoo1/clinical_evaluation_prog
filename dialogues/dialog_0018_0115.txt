DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it's my… a patient of mine. He’s been looking rather yellow, you see. A dreadful color. Something about his liver, I believe. It’s all a bit… hazy, if you don’t mind me saying. I'm Annelle Durig, by the way. Though I suppose you know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, I do. It’s perfectly alright that things are hazy; that's what I’m here for. You mentioned a patient of yours is exhibiting jaundice – the yellowing of the skin – and you suspect a liver issue. To clarify, are you a healthcare professional yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Yes, I am. A medical dosimetrist, actually. Though it's been… some time since I was actively practicing. A very long time. It's the calculations, you see. Precise work. But this patient… he’s been under my care for a while, and I noticed the change. It worries me, even if I can't quite recall all the details. Is that… alright? Is that enough information? I do wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. It’s very astute of you to notice and seek guidance, even after a period of time away from active practice. Your professional background is helpful context. To understand the situation better, could you tell me more about this patient?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's the difficult part. He… he has hepatitis, I believe. Or some sort of liver disease. It's been a long course of treatment. He's… middle-aged, I suppose. A quiet man. Not much for talking about his feelings. I’ve been calculating his radiation dosages, naturally, but I don't handle the medical side of things directly. I just... I noticed the yellowing, and it's been getting worse lately. Is that helpful? I feel terribly disorganized. Perhaps you have some questions for me?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Durig. Don’t apologize for feeling disorganized; it’s perfectly reasonable given the circumstances. You’re focusing on your area of expertise, and you’ve rightfully flagged a concerning symptom. Let's try to gather a bit more information. Do you know approximately how long ago he was diagnosed with hepatitis or the liver disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a very good question. It was… several years ago, I believe. Perhaps five? Maybe more. It was before… before my husband passed. Yes, definitely before then. It was a gradual thing. He wasn't acutely ill at first. Just… tired, I think. I really wish I could give you a more precise timeframe. I feel useless. Is there a test you could just… do on him to find out? Perhaps that would be simpler.
DOCTOR: You are not useless at all, Ms. Durig. You've brought a valuable observation to my attention, and that's what matters. It's understandable that details are hazy after some time. Yes, there are many tests we can perform to assess his liver function and determine the cause of the jaundice. We'll need to draw some blood and likely order some imaging studies as well. First, let's focus on getting some basic information about him. Do you happen to know his name and date of birth?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. His name… is Mr… Mr. Abernathy. Yes, that’s right. Abernathy. And his birthday… That’s… that’s difficult. I don’t believe I ever asked. I just received the dosage requests and sent them back. I am terribly sorry. I truly am. Is it… is it essential to know his birthday? Perhaps his insurance… would have it? I don't even know if he has insurance. He's a very private man. I'm just making this more complicated, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You are not making things more complicated, Ms. Durig. It's perfectly alright. Patient privacy is important, and it's common for information to be incomplete. Knowing his date of birth would be helpful for accurate record-keeping and to ensure we have the correct medical history, but we can certainly proceed without it initially. Perhaps you could tell me if you know where he receives his medical care?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. Yes, I do know that. He goes to… Dr. Peterson. On Elm Street. A general practitioner, I believe. A very nice man. I’ve seen him in the waiting room a few times. Peterson… yes. Dr. Samuel Peterson. That's right. He has a small practice, very local. I believe he accepts most insurance plans, but I haven't any direct knowledge of it. Will that help? Perhaps you could contact him? He'll have all the necessary details.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Durig. Knowing his primary care physician is excellent. I will certainly attempt to obtain his medical records from Dr. Peterson’s office. In the meantime, let’s talk a little about what you've observed in terms of his symptoms. Besides the yellowing of the skin, have you noticed any other changes in him?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. He’s been… more fatigued, I think. Yes, definitely more tired than usual. And… he's lost a little weight, perhaps? It's hard to say, as he wasn't a large man to begin with. He also seemed… a bit more confused lately. Just a little disoriented, you know? Not severe, but noticeable. And… He complained of an itching sensation, I believe. Yes, a persistent itch. Is that… is that important? I do apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more helpful. .
DOCTOR: Those are all very important observations, Ms. Durig. Fatigue, weight loss, confusion, and itching can all be associated with liver disease and are valuable pieces of information. Please, don't apologize at all. You're providing me with exactly what I need. Now, regarding his confusion – has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually?
