DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Piet, huh? Sounds… foreign. Well, I been feelin’ kinda… winded. Like I can’t get enough air, you know? And my mouth… always feels like sandpaper. Eyes too, dry as dust. Been happenin’ for a while now, I guess. Don’t rightly remember when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling winded, dry mouth and eyes… and you've noticed this for a while now. “Old age” can certainly bring changes, but let's try to figure out what's going on. When you say “winded,” does that happen with activity, or even at rest?
PATIENT: Activity? Rest? Uh… both, I think. Or maybe just… all the time? Look, I don't spend much time runnin' marathons, if that’s what you’re askin’. It's just… hard to breathe. Always feel like I gotta take a bigger breath. And it doesn’t help that my mouth feels like the Sahara in here. You got any water?
DOCTOR: Yes, feeling short of breath both with activity and at rest is good to know. And the dry mouth definitely adds to the discomfort. I do have some water. Here you go. Now, besides the shortness of breath and dry mouth, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… symptoms… let me think. Well, I get tired easy. Real easy. And my… my legs kinda ache sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. And I… I don’t sleep as good as I used to. Just tossin’ and turnin’. But everyone gets old, right? Don’t see what that has to do with… air.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, leg aches, and trouble sleeping... I’m noting all of that. You’re right, those things can come with age. But we need to see if they're connected to the difficulty you're having breathing. Now, have you had any chest pain, coughing, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not really. A little tightness sometimes, but I figure that's just… old man stuff. Coughin’? Not much. Maybe a little tickle in my throat now and then, but nothin' serious. Swelling… uh… I haven't looked at my feet lately. Don't really bother with that sort of thing. Too much trouble bendin' over. Honestly, I just want to be able to breathe without feelin’ like I’m drownin’. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that is not too much to ask at all. We’ll work to figure this out. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like heart problems, lung problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me see. The doctor… years ago… said somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ a little high. But I don't take pills for it. Didn't seem worth the bother. And I think I had somethin’ with my… stomach, once. Ulcer, maybe? But that was a long time ago. Never had any trouble with my lungs, not that I remember. And diabetes? Never been told that. I eat what I want, when I want. Not gonna lie about that. Is this important? You makin’ me nervous askin’ all these questions.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Guilds, and I apologize if I'm making you nervous. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. High blood pressure is definitely something we’ll want to check again. Okay, any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hospitalizations… let me think. Uh… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That was a long time ago, of course. And… I was in the hospital once for a broken leg. Fell off a ladder paintin’ my house. But that was… oh, must be fifty years ago. I don’t remember much about it. Mostly just pain. And nurses. And bad food. You askin' about everythin’ that ever happened to me?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a full picture, Mr. Guilds. Okay, appendix and a broken leg – good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, I had a brother, but he passed away a few years back. Heart trouble, I think. And a sister, but we don’t talk much anymore. She moved to Florida, you know? All about the sunshine and… early bird specials. As for medical problems… my mother had somethin’ with her… joints. Arthritis, maybe? And my father… I think he had high blood pressure too. But honestly, I don’t pay much attention to all that family stuff. Everyone’s got somethin’, right? Is this gettin’ us anywhere? I still can’t breathe easy.
DOCTOR: It is getting us somewhere, Mr. Guilds, thank you. Family history of heart problems and arthritis is helpful information. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My brother smoked, though. Killed him, probably. Bad habit, that is. Used to stink up the whole house. I always told him he was shortenin' his life, and he just laughed. Bad fella. Never did listen to reason. So, no, I don't smoke. Never have, never will. Now, can we get this over with? I'm gettin' tired just talkin' about all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking history is excellent. Now, before we finish with questions, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… vitamins… uh… let me think. No, not really. I take a little somethin’ for my… stomach, sometimes. Just when it bothers me. Something I got from the drugstore. Can’t remember the name of it. And I used to take a multivitamin, but I ran out a while back and never bothered to get more. Honestly, I don't believe in all those pills. They just make you feel worse, if you ask me. So, no, not really. Just the stomach stuff, now and then. Can we please get to the exam now? My chest is feelin' tighter just sittin' here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, we can do that. Just one last quick thing, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to nothin'. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just from spicy food. I don't think that counts as an allergy. So, no, no allergies. Finally. Can we get on with it? I'm startin' to feel lightheaded. This is ridiculous. I came here to breathe, not answer a million questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, you’re right. Let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just hurry up, please. My chest is really botherin' me now. And try not to poke too much, alright? Old bones, you know. And don't expect me to be able to hold my breath for long. I ain't as young as I used to be. Just get it over with. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and again… good. I'm hearing some… wheezing in your lungs, Mr. Guilds. It's subtle, but it's there. And your breathing sounds a little labored. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure… Your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 90. And your pulse is a little fast, at 92. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears… Your ears look clear. And your throat looks okay, a little dry. Now, let me listen to your heart again… Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not loud, but it's there. Okay, that’s all for now. I'm noting all of these findings.
PATIENT: Murmur? Elevated… what was it? Sounds bad. What does all that mean? I knew somethin' was wrong. This is exactly why I don't like doctors. Always findin' somethin' wrong with you. You gonna give me pills? I don’t want pills! I just want to be able to breathe! Tell me straight, what’s wrong with me? Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, please try to stay calm. I understand you’re anxious, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. The wheezing I heard in your lungs suggests some narrowing of your airways, which could be due to a number of things, like asthma or chronic bronchitis. The elevated blood pressure is concerning and needs to be addressed. And the murmur I heard in your heart is a slight abnormal sound and requires further investigation. Now, I’m not saying you have anything serious, but these findings need to be looked into more carefully. I want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I also want to do some blood tests to check your oxygen levels and rule out any infection. I’m not going to prescribe any medication right now until we have the results of these tests. But it’s possible you may need medication to help open your airways or lower your blood pressure, depending on what we find. Would you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? This is ridiculous! I’m an old man, not a science project! What’s the point of all these tests if you're just gonna give me pills anyway? Look, I’ve lived a long life without all this fancy equipment. I just need some air, that’s all! But… if you think it’s necessary… I guess so. But no promises about not complainin’. And hurry up, alright? I ain’t got all day. What do I gotta do? Where do I go? Just tell me straight, no complicated instructions. I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, I understand your frustration. We'll get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. You'll need to go to the radiology department for the chest X-ray. It's located on the third floor, just past the cafeteria. They’ll take a picture of your lungs. Then, you’ll go to the lab on the second floor for the blood tests. They’ll take a small sample of your blood. And finally, the technician will perform an EKG in the exam room right here. I’ll give you these requisitions to take with you. They’ll need these to process the tests. The lab and radiology technicians will explain everything to you. They’re very good at what they do. Once the results are back—usually within a day or two—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. Do you have any questions about where to go or what to expect?
PATIENT: Third floor… cafeteria… second floor… lab… Requisi-what? Just a bunch of floors and papers. I guess I don’t have a choice, do I? It’s either this, or I can’t breathe. I swear, if these tests take all day… And what if they find somethin' bad? I don't want to know. Just tell me what to do, alright? No complicated instructions. Third floor first, right? Near the… food? Just point me in the right direction. And hurry up, alright? I’m gettin' tired just thinkin' about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, third floor first. Just head down the hallway to the elevators. Take the elevator to the third floor and turn right when you get off. You'll see the cafeteria on your left. The radiology department is right next to it. The receptionist there will help you with everything. And Mr. Guilds, please try not to worry. We’re just gathering information to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. I’ll be here to discuss the results with you when they come back, and we’ll make a plan together. Here’s a map of the clinic. Do you think you’ll be able to manage?
PATIENT: Map… more papers… Honestly, I’m lost already. Third floor… turn right… elevator… It’s a miracle I can even find my way to the bathroom. But… I guess I gotta try, right? No other choice, do I? Alright, fine. I’ll go. But if I get lost, I’m comin’ back here and demandin’ a personal escort. And if these tests take all day, you’re buyin’ me lunch. Just… tell me again, third floor, turn right? And find the… food place? I think that’s all I can handle for now. I’m gettin’ a headache. Just… let me go. And hurry up, alright? I wanna get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Yes, third floor, turn right, and you'll see the cafeteria. The radiology department is right next to it. And don't hesitate to ask anyone for help if you get lost. I'll see you when you get back, Mr. Guilds. And don't worry, we'll take care of you. .
