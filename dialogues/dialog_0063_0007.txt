DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Reihner. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have a rather full schedule, so if we could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. My back… it hurts. Has been for a while now, truthfully. I work with fences – erecting them – and it’s just gotten worse and worse. I need to know what’s going on, if that makes sense. I’m Lakiya Reihner, by the way. Though I suppose you have that already.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, I do. Fences, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Building them. Lots of lifting, bending… it’s hard work. Mostly wood and wire. We do some metal posts too, but not as much. It’s the lifting, I think. And the twisting to get the wire tight. It started as just a little ache, but now… now it’s a proper pain. Makes it hard to sleep, even.
DOCTOR: “Proper pain,” you say. And how long has this “proper pain” been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… maybe three months now of the ache getting worse. But the really bad pain, the kind that keeps me up at night… that started about two weeks ago. It's mostly in my lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my leg, a little. Not all the way, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Two weeks of “shooting” pain… Hmm. And have you tried anything to alleviate this discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I've been taking… well, I take some pills. Acetaminophen, I think it’s called. My neighbor gave me some. It helps a little, but not much. And I’ve been trying to rest, but with the work… it’s difficult. I tried a warm bath once, but it didn’t seem to do anything, either. Honestly, I don’t know what to do anymore.
DOCTOR: Acetaminophen… from a neighbor, you say. Right. Well, we really need to get a proper history. Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not exactly. Not weakness, no. Sometimes my feet feel a little… tingly. Just at the end of the day, when I’m really tired. It goes away when I sit and rest them. But not weak. I can still walk alright, and I need to be able to, for the work. It wouldn’t do to fall up on a fence, now would it?
DOCTOR: And any history of prior back injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve always been… sturdy, I guess. I mean, I’ve had little aches and pains, like anyone else, but nothing serious. No falls, no breaks, no operations. This is new. And it’s worrying me. I don't want this to get worse and keep me from my work. It’s all I have, really. My husband… he passed a few years back. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a quick examination then. If you could please lie down on the examination table, face up. I'll need to assess your range of motion and check for any neurological deficits. We’ll try to be swift.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you’ll excuse me… . It’s a little cold, isn’t it? But yes, go ahead. I'll try to stay still. Just… tell me if anything hurts too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you point to where the pain is most concentrated?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. And it kind of… goes around, you know? Not just one spot. And when you press here… … that’s where it really hurts. It’s a deep ache, not a sharp pain. Unless… unless you press right there. Then it’s sharp. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be precise.
DOCTOR: Reflexes appear normal. Some tenderness upon palpation of the lumbar spine, as you’ve indicated. No obvious neurological deficits noted at this time. I suspect… a muscle strain. Though, given the radiating pain, we shouldn’t rule out a disc issue entirely. I'll order some imaging, just to be certain.
PATIENT: Imaging, you say? Like… an X-ray? Or one of those… noisy machines? Honestly, Doctor, I don't like those machines. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. I just… I need to get back to work, you know? How long will it take to get the results? And what does a “disc issue” mean, exactly? I don’t understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: An MRI, most likely. It’s more… informative. And yes, it is rather noisy. A “disc issue” means a problem with the cushions between the bones in your spine. It could be a bulge, a tear… several things. As for how long, the results will take several days to be processed and reviewed. In the meantime, I’m prescribing a course of muscle relaxants and a stronger pain reliever. I also recommend physical therapy. It’s imperative that you limit strenuous activity until we have a definitive diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxants… and physical therapy. Physical therapy… that’ll mean going somewhere, and taking time off work… I suppose I have no choice, if it’ll help. Several days… That feels like a long time. And what about… working? Can I do anything at all? Like, maybe some light tasks? I can’t just sit around doing nothing. It’s not in my nature. And… will Medicare cover all of this? The therapy, the scans… it all adds up, you know.
DOCTOR: “Light tasks”… I strongly advise against it until the MRI results are in. Risking further injury will only complicate matters. As for Medicare coverage, yes, it should cover the prescribed treatment, though you will likely have a co-pay. I will have the staff provide you with the necessary paperwork. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… the paperwork, please. And… maybe a clear explanation of what I need to avoid while I’m waiting for the results? What kind of pain should I call about, right away? I don’t want to worry needlessly, but I also don’t want to ignore something important. This is all a bit… overwhelming, to be honest. I appreciate your help, Doctor. Truly. But it’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: This outlines the necessary precautions and warning signs. If you experience any severe weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or intense, unrelenting pain, proceed to the nearest emergency room immediately. Avoid lifting, bending, and twisting. Rest, take the medication as prescribed, and attend your physical therapy appointments. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The staff will schedule your MRI and physical therapy. Good day, Ms. Reihner.
PATIENT: .
