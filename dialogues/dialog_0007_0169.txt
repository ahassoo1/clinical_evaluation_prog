DOCTOR: Hi Derick, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc... it's this puffiness, see? My face... and legs. Been gettin' worse lately. Not sure why it's happenin', to be honest. Old age, probably. Everything goes when you get old, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, puffiness in your face and legs. And you've noticed it getting worse recently. I understand your thought about it possibly being related to age, but we definitely want to figure out what’s going on. Just to be thorough, can you tell me when you first started noticing this puffiness?
PATIENT: Hmm... when, you say? That's a tough one. Seems like... a few months, maybe? Can't rightly say when exactly. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it's barely there, other times... well, like today. I don't really keep track of these things. Is it important to know the date? Seems like a lot of fuss over a little puffiness.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a timeframe, even a rough one, to see if anything else changed around the same time. But don’t worry if you can't pinpoint an exact date. A few months is good enough for now. You mentioned it comes and goes – is there anything you’ve noticed that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Worse or better... now there's a question. Let me think... hot weather, definitely makes it worse. And if I'm on my feet all day, it swells up somethin' awful. Used to be able to work all day without a problem, but now... not so much. Doesn't seem to get better with much, honestly. Maybe when I sit and put my feet up? But that's just... bein' lazy, really. Doesn't cure it, just... takes the edge off. I don’t go to doctors often. Never have. This whole thing is a bother, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hot weather and being on your feet for long periods seem to make it worse. And resting with your feet up provides some temporary relief. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the puffiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me see. Well, I get a bit… winded, sometimes. Especially climbin' stairs. Thought that was just… gettin' old, too. And my ankles feel kinda… achey. Not all the time, just when they’re really swollen. And… I’ve been more tired lately, I suppose. But who isn’t tired these days? I don’t know if any of that’s connected to the puffiness though. It’s probably just… normal stuff, you know? Old age catchin' up.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, especially with stairs, achy ankles when swollen, and increased fatigue. Those could be related, and it's good you're telling me everything, even if you think it's just "normal stuff." Now, have you had any chest pain, any dizziness, or changes in how much you're urinating?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, thankfully. Never had chest pain. Dizziness… not really. Maybe a little lightheaded if I stand up too fast, but I always figured that was just my blood pressure. And… urinating… Well, I go to the bathroom, of course! What kind of question is that? I don't really… measure it or anything. Not more or less than usual, I don't think. Is this a trick question, doc? You're askin' awful personal things.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a trick question, and I apologize if it felt too personal. It’s just important to rule out certain things. We’re just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, so no chest pain, no significant dizziness, and urination hasn’t changed. Have you had any problems with your kidneys or liver in the past?
PATIENT: Kidneys or liver… Goodness, no! Never had any trouble with those things. Always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. I eat my vegetables, I don't drink too much… well, not anymore. Used to enjoy a beer now and then, but my wife… well, she didn’t like it. But no, no kidney or liver problems. Never been told I had any. Just… normal stuff, you know? This is a lot of questions for a bit of puffiness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of kidney or liver problems. And you mentioned you used to drink alcohol, but not anymore. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Not really. Not anymore. Used to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, a little white pill, but the doctor took me off it years ago. Said I didn’t need it anymore. And… that’s it. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I don't believe in takin’ a bunch of pills if I can avoid it. Makes you feel worse than what you're tryin’ to fix. No vitamins, no supplements, nothin’. Just… me. And this puffiness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you used to take medication for high blood pressure but are no longer on it, and you don't take any other regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or insects?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. Bit of a runny nose in the spring, maybe, but that’s just the pollen. And I get a few mosquito bites in the summer, but who doesn’t? Nothing serious, nothin’ that requires a trip to the doctor. I'm pretty tough, you know? Built like a Swede! Don't break out in rashes or have trouble breathin’ or anythin’ like that. Never have. This is a lot of fuss over a little puffiness, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it’s a lot of questions, but it helps me get a full picture. Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, kidney problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? My mother… she had a bad heart. Died when I was young. And my father… he had somethin’ with his kidneys, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don't rightly remember the details. And my sister… she got the sugar, diabetes, they called it. Spent her last years not bein' able to eat much of anythin'. And, yeah, my wife’s side… high blood pressure, I think. Lots of it. It seems like everyone in my family has somethin’ wrong with ‘em. Not much good luck on that front, I tell ya. Honestly, doc, it’s a long list. Makes you wonder what won’t go wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Heart disease in your mother, kidney problems in your father, diabetes in your sister, and high blood pressure on your wife’s side. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! Never touched the stuff. My wife… she hated it. Said it was a terrible habit. And I always figured she was right. I don’t need anythin’ messin’ with my lungs. Never had the urge, never even tried it. A good, clean livin’ Swede, that’s what I am. And always have been. Now, my friends… some of ‘em smoked, back in the day. But not me. Never touched it. And I'm glad I didn't. A terrible habit, I tell ya. Just ask my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, you’ve never smoked. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well, like I said before, I used to enjoy a beer now and then. Mostly on weekends. But it's been years since I had a drink. Not since my wife passed away. She didn’t approve of it, and… well, I didn't want to upset her. And after she was gone… didn't seem right, you know? Just didn't have the taste for it anymore. Maybe a sip at Christmas now and then, to remember her, but that’s about it. Not much of a drinker these days. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you used to drink occasionally but have stopped in recent years. Now, what about your activity level?
PATIENT: Activity level… Well, not what it used to be, that's for sure. Used to be a carpenter, built houses, worked hard all day. But that was years ago. Now… I mostly sit around. Read the paper, watch TV. Take a little walk now and then, if the weather’s nice. But it’s not much. This puffiness makes it hard to get around, you know? Don’t have the energy I used to. Mostly just… takin’ it easy these days. Too old for much else, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’ve reduced your activity level and are mostly taking it easy. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Well, I suppose so. But don't go pokin' around too much, doc. I’m a sensitive fella. And I don’t like bein’ touched. Just be gentle, alright? And tell me what you're doin’ before you do it. Don’t want any surprises. And try to be quick about it. I’m not one for lingerin’ around. Alright, go ahead then. But be gentle, remember?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as gentle as possible and explain everything before I do it. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Okay, your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. I hear some faint crackling sounds in your lungs, especially on the lower sides. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Now, let's check your ankles. I see some significant swelling in your ankles, and when I press on them, it leaves a visible indentation. That's what we call pitting edema. Your feet also show some swelling, but less pronounced than your ankles. Skin is warm and dry. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90. Okay, that's what I’m seeing. There’s some crackling in your lungs, swelling in your ankles and feet, and your blood pressure is a bit high. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Crackling in my lungs… swelling… high blood pressure… What does that mean, doc? Is it somethin' serious? Is it my heart? My father had somethin' with his kidneys, you said, and my mother… her heart. Is it somethin' I got from them? Is this what happens when you get old? All this puffiness, and now cracklin' and swellin'… It sounds terrible. Tell me straight, doc. Don't sugarcoat it. Is it bad? Am I gonna… you know…?
DOCTOR: Okay, Derick, let's take it one step at a time. I understand your worry, and it's good you're asking these questions. The crackling in your lungs could indicate some fluid buildup, which can happen with several things, including heart problems, but also lung issues. The swelling in your ankles, called edema, can also be a sign of heart failure, kidney problems, or even problems with your veins. And your blood pressure is a bit elevated, which can contribute to these problems. Now, I'm not saying you have heart failure. We need more information to figure out what's going on. Your family history does make it important to investigate this thoroughly. It could be related to something you inherited, but it could also be something else entirely. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some tests. These include a complete blood count to check your overall health, a kidney function test to see how well your kidneys are working, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We may also need to do an echocardiogram to look at the structure and function of your heart. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… More pokin’ and proddin’, huh? I don't like tests, doc. Never have. But… I suppose if you think it's necessary. I just want to know what's wrong, and I want somethin' done about it. Don't want to just sit here and wait for it to get worse. But tell me… how long will it take? And what if the tests are… bad? What if it is somethin’ serious? And… how much will all this cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Don’t have a lot of money to throw around.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Derick. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about tests and the potential results. As for how long it will take, the blood tests are quick, usually just a few minutes. The EKG is also fairly fast, about 10-15 minutes. The chest X-ray will take a little longer, maybe 20-30 minutes. The echocardiogram will take the longest, probably around an hour. We can schedule these over a few days to make it easier. As for the costs, I know you’re on a fixed income, and that’s important. I’ll have my staff check the costs for each test and see if there are any financial assistance programs available. We can also discuss the most essential tests first to keep the costs down. Regarding the results, I want to be upfront: it’s too early to say what’s going on. But we’ll get the information we need to make a proper diagnosis and create a treatment plan. If it turns out to be something serious, there are many treatments available, and we’ll discuss all your options. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. We’ll take it one step at a time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: One step at a time… Alright. One step at a time. That… that sounds better. Can you… can you explain what each test actually does? I don’t understand all that medical talk. What will they be lookin' at? And… will it hurt? And… if they find somethin’ wrong, will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to go to the hospital. Just tell me… what am I in for? Honestly. What am I in for?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I can explain everything in plain language. Let's start with the blood tests. These will give us a general overview of your health, checking things like your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. It's just a small sample of blood taken from your arm, and it doesn’t hurt much – just a quick pinch. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, measures the electrical activity of your heart. They’ll place some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart rhythm. It doesn't hurt at all – you won't feel anything. The chest X-ray takes a picture of your lungs and heart. You’ll stand in front of a machine, and it takes a quick image. It doesn't hurt, but you’ll need to hold your breath for a few seconds. And finally, the echocardiogram uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. They’ll put some gel on your chest and move a probe around, and it shows us how well your heart is pumping. It doesn’t hurt, but it can feel a little cold. As for the hospital, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Most likely, these tests will help us figure out what's going on, and we can manage it with medication and lifestyle changes. If, for some reason, you do need to go to the hospital, we’ll discuss all the options and make sure you’re comfortable with the plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: That… that makes a little more sense. No hospital right away, that’s good. Just tests. And stickers and gel. Alright. Let’s get the tests done then. When can we do them? And… will I need someone to drive me? I don’t like drivin’ when I’m nervous. And… can you tell my staff to be gentle? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. Alright. Let’s do it. But be gentle, alright? And no hospital right away, remember?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we’ll be as gentle as possible. And no hospital right away, I promise. We can schedule the blood tests and EKG for tomorrow morning, and the chest X-ray and echocardiogram can be done the day after. That gives us a little time to spread things out. I recommend having someone drive you, just for peace of mind. It’s always good to have someone with you when you’re feeling anxious. I’ll let my staff know to be extra gentle with you. They’re all very kind and understanding. Let me write down the schedule and give you the contact information for the lab and radiology department. Here you go. If you have any questions or concerns before the tests, please don’t hesitate to call my office. We’re going to figure this out, Derick. Just take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Alright. Tomorrow morning… and the day after. Thank you, doc. You’ve been… well, you’ve been very helpful. I still don’t like tests, but… I feel a little better now. Knowing what to expect, that’s good. Alright then. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow morning. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Derick. I’ll see you tomorrow morning. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day.
