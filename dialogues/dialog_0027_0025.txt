DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome. My name is Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my people. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test, with spit, to find out? My son, he told me about it. I want to know where my family really from.
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. Your son is referring to genetic ancestry testing. Yes, we can arrange for that. It involves a saliva sample, and it can give you some information about your ancestral origins. However, it’s important to understand it doesn’t tell the whole story, and the results can sometimes be…complex. It’s more about percentages and broad regions, rather than pinpointing a specific village. Before we proceed with that, though, are you experiencing any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Health? Not really. Old, you know? But strong for my age, I think. I build things… little boats, mostly. Wood. Always worked with wood. No sickness, no pain… just want to know about my family. Is the test… hard? Do I have to drink something bad?
DOCTOR: No, no drinking anything bad at all! It’s a very simple test. We just need a small sample of your saliva – a little spit in a tube. It's quite painless, really. Just to be thorough, when you say you feel strong, are you having any trouble with your memory?
PATIENT: Memory… sometimes I forget names. But everyone forgets names! I remember how to build the boats, though. Been doing it too long to forget that. I remember my mother, her stories… she told me we came from… well, I don’t remember exactly where. That’s why I want the test! Is it expensive? My son said it costs money.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal at your age, forgetting names. Good that you remember your mother's stories – that’s wonderful. Yes, the test does have a cost, and it’s not always fully covered by insurance, even Medicare. Let me check the current pricing for you… It’s approximately $250 for the standard ancestry test. We can also discuss options for more detailed testing, but that would be more expensive. Before we decide, just to be completely sure, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Two hundred fifty dollar… okay. My son can help. I eat okay… fish, mostly. And rice. Not much beef, too expensive. Weight… maybe a little less. Old age, you know? Everything goes down. I want to know about my family, Doctor. Where they lived before. Is this test find that? Will it tell me if I have cousins somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, the test can give you an idea of potential relatives, although connecting with them would be a separate process. It focuses on identifying your ancestral origins, showing you the regions your ancestors likely came from. It provides a breakdown of your ethnic percentages, which can be very interesting. Given your recent weight loss, even if it's attributed to age, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. It’s a routine part of a visit, and it's good to have that information. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay… if you think so. I trust you, Doctor. I don't like doctors much, but you seem nice. Check my heart… if you must. But hurry, please. I want to get the spit test done. I’m excited to see what it says! Will I get results fast?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your trust, Mr. Scobie. I'll make it quick. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, which isn't necessarily concerning given your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, about the spit test… it usually takes about 2-3 weeks to get the results back from the lab. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss them together. Before we do that, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medicine, Doctor. Never taken medicine in my life! And no allergies… I eat everything. Fish, rice, coconuts… everything. Just want to know my family. Is the spit test… painful? Do I have to open my mouth wide? I don't like dentists either, you see.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, it's not painful at all! And you don't have to open your mouth wide. It's just a small sample of saliva—you simply spit into a tube. It’s very similar to providing a sample for a COVID test. Just one more question before we proceed. Do you have any family history of serious illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she died old, very old. But she got sick at the end. Maybe… tummy sickness? My father, he fell from a tree, long time ago. That’s how he died. Nobody talked much about sickness in my family. We just… got sick and died, sometimes. Is the spit test tell me if I will get sick?
DOCTOR: That's understandable. The test itself doesn't predict whether you will get sick, Mr. Scobie. It focuses on your ancestral origins. However, knowing your family history can help us understand your risk for certain conditions and guide preventative care. Given your family history, even with the limited information, it's good to be aware. Okay, let's proceed with the spit test. I'll have the nurse bring in the collection kit and explain the process. We’ll send it off to the lab and schedule that follow-up appointment for about three weeks from now. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I’m excited now! Bring the spit, please. I want to know my family. I’ve waited a long time for this. Is it a big tube? I don’t have much spit, you know. Old age!
DOCTOR: It's not a big tube, Mr. Scobie, don't worry. Just a small amount is needed, and we can always collect a little more if necessary. I’ll have the nurse come in right away with the kit. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m just going to document some of the information we’ve discussed. It’s important to have a good record of everything. .
PATIENT: .
