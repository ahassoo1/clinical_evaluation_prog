DOCTOR: Right. Marija Chilla, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s about… planning, shall we say. My husband and I were discussing, and we feel it’s time to get some affairs in order. Specifically, I’d like to complete one of those forms… the one where you write down what you want done if you are unable to speak for yourself. A directive, I believe it’s called? It feels… responsible.
DOCTOR: A directive… yes, an advance healthcare directive. Quite sensible, I suppose. Though, usually people come in when something is wrong, not to prepare for… eventualities. But alright. It's a fairly straightforward process. Do you have any existing documentation, or is this entirely new?
PATIENT: Entirely new, Doctor. We’ve never done anything like this before. My husband suggested it, actually. He's always been… thorough. I simply wish to be certain my wishes are known, should something unforeseen occur. It's not something I enjoy thinking about, naturally.
DOCTOR: Thorough, yes. A useful quality. Very well. It involves outlining your preferences for medical treatment, designating a healthcare proxy… it’s a bit legalistic, I admit. Before we begin listing specific treatments, let's cover some basics. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing of any significance, Doctor. I maintain a healthy lifestyle – a balanced diet, regular exercise. A touch of arthritis in my knees, perhaps, as one gets older, but nothing that requires ongoing treatment. It’s more discomfort than a condition, really. My general practitioner assures me it’s perfectly normal. I am a very healthy woman, overall.
DOCTOR: Arthritis… noted. “Perfectly normal” is a relative term, of course, but we’ll keep that in mind. Alright. Any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve always been quite… robust. A childhood bout of measles, I suppose, but that’s hardly significant. Nothing requiring hospitalization, no major operations. My family has good genes, I believe. We tend to live long lives.
DOCTOR: Good genes are… helpful. And your parents?
PATIENT: Both still living, Doctor. My mother is 78 and quite sprightly, still tending her garden. My father is 82, a retired professor – very… opinionated, but otherwise healthy. He’s had the usual age-related aches and pains, of course, but nothing debilitating. They live in Morocco, so I don’t see them as often as I’d like.
DOCTOR: And you, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I said, I pride myself on maintaining good health. A multivitamin occasionally, but that’s hardly a medication. I prefer natural remedies where possible – herbal teas, a healthy diet. I’m not one for relying on pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. I’ve always been able to eat and take whatever is necessary without issue. I believe a strong constitution is key. It's really quite simple, isn't it? Good health, proper living... Is this process typically so… involved for something so straightforward?
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to cover all bases, Mrs. Chilla. Routine, really. Now, let’s briefly discuss your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I find such habits… appalling. My husband and I maintain a very respectable lifestyle. A glass of sparkling water with dinner, perhaps, but nothing stronger. We prefer cultural pursuits – theatre, museums, intellectual conversation. We are both educators, you see. It's important to set a good example.
DOCTOR: Very good, very good. Now, before we move onto the actual directive, let's do a brief physical exam, just to establish a baseline. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs… standard procedure.
PATIENT: An examination? Doctor, with all due respect, I came here to complete a form, not undergo a physical. I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. A waste of my time, frankly. Are you suggesting I'm somehow… unwell? I explained all of this already.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Chilla, it is standard procedure. I am documenting your current state of health as a reference point. It takes five minutes. Frankly, it’s prudent. If you wish to proceed with this directive, I need to fulfill my professional obligations. Do you want me to continue, or shall we simply… disregard the entire process?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? This is… quite unreasonable. I came to you seeking a simple administrative task, and you insist on treating me as though I am… a patient requiring extensive medical attention! It’s utterly absurd. My husband will be most displeased. I think I’ll seek a second opinion. A doctor who understands the meaning of respect, and doesn’t waste my time with unnecessary examinations. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Chilla. As you wish. I must insist you seek proper medical care if your condition changes, however. Good day. .
