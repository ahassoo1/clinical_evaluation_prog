DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I don't have all day. I want to be pregnant. A healthy pregnancy. No… complications. I’m 51, yes, but I’m in good shape. I want to know what I need to do to make that happen, and quickly. I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. You're looking to explore the possibility of a healthy pregnancy, and you'd like to discuss the steps involved and ensure there are no obstacles. That's perfectly reasonable. To best advise you, I'll need to gather some information. Could you tell me if you've been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: Trying? Doctor, please. This isn’t my first rodeo. Let’s just say… timing hasn’t been optimal until recently. And, frankly, I'd like to avoid a long, drawn-out process. I want to know what tests need to be done, what supplements I should be taking, and if there’s anything… special… I need to consider given my age. Are you following me? I want a plan, not a life story.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm following you perfectly. You're looking for a focused approach to optimize your chances of a healthy pregnancy, and you'd like to know what investigations and interventions are appropriate given your age. Let’s start with some background information, if you don’t mind. Could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, now we get to the history. Fine. Divorced, as if that’s relevant. Medicare, for what it's worth. I've had the usual things – a broken arm when I was a child, the flu a few times. Nothing… major. No chronic illnesses. I exercise regularly – cycling, obviously – and I eat a reasonably healthy diet. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink. Is that sufficient, or do you need a detailed account of every childhood sniffle? I really do have things to do today.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Shteynberg, thank you. No chronic illnesses, regular exercise, healthy diet, no smoking, and limited alcohol intake – that’s excellent. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just the broken arm, I told you. They set it, put a cast on it. Very standard. No other surgeries. Look, Doctor, are we getting anywhere, or are we just cataloging my life? I need to know what’s possible, and what I need to do. Specifically.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if it feels slow. It's important to gather this information to create the most appropriate plan for you. Regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 85. My father had… nothing remarkable, really. He was a healthy man. No genetic disorders that I’m aware of. We weren’t exactly a family that spent a lot of time discussing medical ailments. Is that good enough? Or do you require a genealogical chart spanning centuries? I swear, Doctor…
DOCTOR: That's perfectly sufficient, Ms. Shteynberg. High blood pressure in your mother is good to know. Now, let’s talk about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And occasionally ibuprofen for a headache. That’s it. No allergies. I'm not some delicate flower, Doctor. I handle things. Are we finally approaching the point where you tell me what I need to do? I haven’t got all day, you know. This is incredibly frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. And yes, we are getting to that point. Given your age – 51 – and your desire to conceive, there are a few important considerations. It's important to acknowledge that pregnancy at this age carries increased risks, both for you and the potential baby. These risks include gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, chromosomal abnormalities, and miscarriage. Before we proceed, I would like to order some blood tests to assess your overall health and ovarian reserve. These tests will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, and levels of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone and Anti-Mullerian Hormone . AMH specifically helps us understand your remaining egg supply. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Of course I’m agreeable to tests. That's what doctors do, isn't it? I expected this. It’s just… get on with it, then. The sooner we have results, the sooner we can determine if this is even feasible. And please, no lecturing about risks. I’m a grown woman. I can weigh the pros and cons. Just… draw the blood and let’s move on. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. That's a very sensible approach. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. My nurse, Sarah, will be expecting you and will take care of the blood draw. She’ll explain the process and answer any questions you may have. After the blood draw, she’ll send the samples to the lab for analysis, and we should have the results back within three to five business days. In the meantime, I recommend starting a prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid. This will help support healthy fetal development should you become pregnant. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. Just get it done. And please, tell your nurse I don't have time for small talk. I'm a busy woman. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. Sarah is very efficient. I’ll let her know. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting for the results. Have a good day.
