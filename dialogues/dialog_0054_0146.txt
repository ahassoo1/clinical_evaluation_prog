DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's... muscle weakness, mostly. Been getting worse the last few weeks, and it’s starting to worry me. I don’t really know how to explain it other than just… feels like I don’t have the strength I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness. And you said it’s been worsening over the last few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, it started small, you know? Just noticing it was a bit harder to lift things at work – auto damage appraisals, lots of bending and reaching. Thought I was just getting old, honestly. But now… even getting out of a chair takes effort sometimes. And stairs? Forget about it. It’s not painful, exactly, just… difficult. It's really frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're paying attention to this and getting it checked out. Not painful, just difficult – that’s helpful to know. When you say “getting out of a chair” and “stairs,” is the weakness in all your muscles, or is it more focused in certain areas – like your legs, arms, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly my legs, I think. And my back feels weak too, like it’s going to give out if I try to lift something heavy. My arms seem okay, thankfully, because, well, my job… needs those. I haven't noticed anything wrong with my arms, anyway. It’s definitely worse when I’m trying to stand up from sitting for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily in your legs and back, worsening with prolonged sitting and standing. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, I guess. Just generally run down. And… this is probably nothing, but my hands have been shaking a little bit sometimes. Not constantly, just… now and then. It’s hard to say if that's related, though. I drink a lot of coffee, you know? Could just be the caffeine.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. Fatigue and intermittent hand shaking – those are both things we should explore further. And it’s good you’re thinking about potential causes like caffeine. Now, let's go through a little more detail. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder control recently?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on. Bladder control? What does that have to do with my muscles being weak? I mean, no, everything's… normal down there. I haven’t noticed anything different. This is getting a little personal, Doc. I just came in about my legs feeling tired, not… that.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. I apologize if that was too direct. It’s just that sometimes weakness and changes in bowel or bladder function can be related, so I have to ask. It’s part of ruling things out. Let's get back to the muscle weakness. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or any recent illnesses or infections?
PATIENT: No fever, no weight loss. I haven’t been sick, not really. Had a bit of a cold a couple months ago, but that was it. Nothing major. Usual stuff, you know? Just the sniffles. I’m usually pretty healthy. This muscle thing is what’s worrying me because it’s new. I don’t usually feel this… weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight loss, recent illness just a mild cold. And you're emphasizing that this weakness is new for you, which is important. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I don’t take any regular medication, either. Oh, wait… I had some physical therapy a few years back for a bad back – pulled something lifting a car at work. But that was years ago, and it's fully recovered. I don't even think about it anymore. This feels… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no existing medical conditions, no regular medications, and a history of a back injury years ago that has fully recovered. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like muscle diseases, neurological problems, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My family… we don’t really talk about health stuff much. My dad had high blood pressure, I think, but he didn’t go to the doctor much. And my mom… she passed away a few years ago. Nothing specific that I know of. Lots of us just get tired easily, if that counts. No one that I know of had anything… serious with their muscles or nerves, though. It's not a topic we discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s common for families to not discuss health matters openly. No known family history of muscle or neurological problems. Finally, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking, no drugs. I drink coffee, like I said, probably too much. And… I have a beer or two with dinner sometimes, on the weekends. Nothing crazy. I work long hours, so I don't really have a lot of time for much else. It’s not a very exciting life, Doc. Mostly just work, and then trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing all of that with me. No smoking, occasional alcohol, and long work hours. Okay, Mr. McKinnon, based on what you've told me, it sounds like we need to investigate this muscle weakness further. Given your symptoms – progressive weakness, fatigue, and the intermittent hand shaking – and the fact that this is new for you, I’d like to do a physical exam, and likely some blood work to start. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I can't keep feeling like this. Exam and blood work, definitely. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, could you please sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. Just tell me what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’m going to tap a little hammer on your knees and ankles. This is perfectly normal, it just helps me see how your nerves are functioning. Okay. And now the other leg. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that good? It feels… weaker than it should be. I'm not sure I have as much grip as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now, I’d like you to resist me as I try to push your hands down. Don’t use force, just hold your position. Okay, good. And now the other arm. Now, let's check your leg strength. Could you try to push your heel down against my hand?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. My leg feels tired already. It’s not as strong as it should be, I can tell. It’s definitely weaker on this side.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now the other leg. Alright. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I lightly touch your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. Just a light touch, right? Feels normal. Yeah, I can feel that one too. Both feet feel the same, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Finally, I'm going to check your gait – how you walk. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Is this okay? It feels a little… off. I’m walking slower than usual, I think. It's harder to balance.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. McKinnon. That’s enough for now. Based on the physical exam, I’m noting slightly diminished reflexes, some weakness in your arms and legs, and a slightly unsteady gait. These findings are not definitive, but they do warrant further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a few other tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to order a Vitamin D level. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. Blood work, Vitamin D… I just want to figure out what’s going on, Doc. I’m starting to get worried. When will I get the results? And what happens after that?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. McKinnon. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. Usually, the results come back within 3-5 business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Depending on the results, we may need to order further testing, such as an MRI or a nerve conduction study. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist. A neurologist is a specialist in the nervous system and can help us determine the cause of your weakness. It's best to have a specialist involved early on. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. A neurologist, MRI, nerve studies… It sounds serious, but I guess that’s what I need, right? 3-5 business days for the blood work… Okay. I’ll wait to hear from you. What should I do in the meantime? Should I… rest? Avoid lifting anything? I mean, I have a job…
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy objects. Try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. If your symptoms worsen – if you experience any new symptoms like numbness, tingling, double vision, or difficulty breathing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. As for your job, see if you can modify your duties to avoid heavy lifting for now. I can write a note to your employer outlining your limitations if needed. We’ll know more once we have the blood work results and the neurologist’s opinion. Don't jump to conclusions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, no heavy lifting, rest, stay hydrated… and go to the ER if things get worse. And a note for work. That’s… helpful. I appreciate it, Doc. I just want to get back to normal, you know? I just want to feel like myself again. When is the best time to schedule that follow-up appointment? After I get the blood work results back?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll schedule the follow-up appointment after we receive the blood work results. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available, usually within 3-5 business days, to get you set up. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doc. Thank you. I’ll wait for the nurse to call with the results. I guess there's nothing else I can do right now. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. And remember, we'll figure this out together. .
