DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have a lot of time, but it's my mum, okay? She's been bruising like crazy lately. She's on that blood thinner stuff... Warfarin, I think it's called? And it just seems worse than usual, even with small bumps.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your mother is bruising easily, and she’s taking Warfarin. That’s good information to start with. It is important to investigate increased bruising in someone on a blood thinner. Do you happen to know what dose of Warfarin she’s on?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, I don’t. She handles all her own meds, and I try not to interfere, you know? She gets upset if I ask too many questions. But… she usually takes it around the same time every evening. A small orange pill, I think. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry about the exact dose. Small orange pill is a good starting point. It's common for patients to manage their own medications, and I understand respecting her independence. Let’s see… I do have some records here. It says she’s been on 5mg of Warfarin daily for… about three years now. And her INR was last checked a month ago and was within the therapeutic range, 2.1. But things can change. Besides the increased bruising, has she noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad to hear it was in range last month. Other symptoms… hmm. She’s been a little more tired than usual, maybe? And she complained about her gums bleeding a bit when she brushes her teeth. Nothing major, she said, just noticed it a couple of times. She's also been saying she feels weak, but she always says that, honestly. She's 83.
DOCTOR: I understand. At 83, it can be hard to sort out what’s new and what’s just… part of getting older. But the tiredness, bleeding gums, and weakness along with the increased bruising definitely warrant a closer look, especially on Warfarin. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to her heart and lungs, check her blood pressure, and take a look at the bruising. It will give me a better idea of what’s going on. And I'll take a look at her gums too. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. She’s at home, right now. I brought her in today because I was worried enough. She's a tough old bird, but… she doesn’t always tell me when something’s really wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you brought her in when you had concerns. That's very attentive of you. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Blood pressure is 138/82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Okay, I see quite a bit of bruising here, varying in color - some older, some more recent. It's present on both arms and legs, no focal tenderness. Now, let's take a look at her gums... Her gums are slightly swollen and there is some minor bleeding when I gently probe them. No signs of any active infection or other lesions. Okay. That gives me some additional information.
PATIENT: Right, she's always had a bit of swelling. The dentist keeps telling her to floss more. Honestly, she just doesn’t like going to the dentist. So, what does all this mean? Is it serious? Is she going to be okay? I just want to know if we need to rush her to the hospital or something.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good we have a baseline understanding of her dental history. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, the increased bruising, along with the bleeding gums and tiredness, could be related to the Warfarin. It’s possible her INR has shifted out of the therapeutic range, meaning her blood isn't clotting as it should. However, it's also important to rule out other causes. While it’s unlikely she needs to rush to the hospital right now, we do need to investigate this further. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a repeat INR test. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'll also check her kidney function, just to be safe. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause injury, and we’ll keep a close eye on her for any signs of more serious bleeding – things like nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in her stool, or any unusual headaches. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. No roughhousing, basically. Okay, blood tests. Good. And you said it’s probably the Warfarin? Is it easy to fix? Can you just… give her a shot or something to make the blood clot again? Look, I'm not a doctor, so I’m just asking.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and it's good you’re thinking through this. Yes, if it is the Warfarin, it's often relatively straightforward to adjust. We can’t simply “give a shot” to make the blood clot again; that would be too risky and could cause other problems. Instead, we can reduce the dose of Warfarin, or in some cases, give a medication called Vitamin K to help counteract its effects. However, we need those blood test results first to determine the best course of action. The blood tests will also help rule out other potential causes of bruising, like a bleeding disorder or other medical conditions. We’ll get those results back within 24-48 hours, and I’ll call you immediately to discuss them. In the meantime, I’ll write out a detailed list of symptoms to watch for, and my contact number if you have any concerns. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that sounds… good. A list is good. And your number. I always worry about forgetting things, so writing it down is a lifesaver. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I think that’s all for now. Hopefully, it's just a simple fix. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand your concerns, and I’m glad I could help. It's good you brought your mother in, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any questions at all. Have a good day, and please tell your mother I said hello.
