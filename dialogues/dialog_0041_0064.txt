DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Is okay if I call you Doctor Polczynski? Good to meet you too. I have… a pain here, in my chest. It started a few days ago, maybe four? It’s not a bad pain, you know? More… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on me, a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do, Sherion. Doctor Polczynski is fine. Okay, uncomfortable... like someone sitting on your chest. Four days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, four days. Maybe a little more, but I think four. It comes and goes. Sometimes I don't feel it at all, and then… poof, it’s back. When I walk up the stairs, it feels worse. But when I sit, it is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, comes and goes, worse with stairs, better with sitting… That's helpful. And just to clarify, is this pain constant when it is there, or does it fluctuate even when you’re experiencing it?
PATIENT: Oh… fluctuate? What does that mean, exactly? Sorry, my English is… not the best sometimes. It's not always the same pain, if that makes sense. Sometimes it feels… tight. And sometimes it feels… like a squeezing. Is that what you mean? It is never sharp, though. Never sharp.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Sherion, please don't apologize at all. "Fluctuate" just means it changes, and you explained it perfectly – sometimes tight, sometimes squeezing. No sharp pain is good to know. Okay. So it’s a tightness or squeezing sensation, comes and goes, worse with stairs… Have you noticed anything that makes it better besides sitting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I take a rest… when I stop doing things and just… be still, it goes away quicker. And… my husband, Ricardo, he makes me chamomile tea. That sometimes helps calm it down. Not always, but… often. Is good tea.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea, that's nice. Okay, so rest and tea seem to help. Have you had any other symptoms along with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I feel a little tired, but I am old! Is normal to be tired. And… sometimes I get a little short of breath when I walk, but that only when I go very fast. Is just… getting old, I think. I don’t have a fever, I check.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tired, shortness of breath with fast walking, no fever. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… Doctor Ramirez, she told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. She gave me a little white pill to take every morning. I take it. I don't remember the name of the pill. And… I had a little surgery on my knee a long time ago, but that doesn't feel connected to this pain. Is just my knee.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, taking a medication for it... and knee surgery. We'll get back to the medication in a moment. Do you know if you have any other medical problems, like with your cholesterol or sugar?
PATIENT: Hmm… Doctor Ramirez, she also checked my sugar, and she said it was… okay. Not high, not low. Just okay. I don't know about my cholesterol. She never said anything about that, if that makes sense. I just go, and she tells me what pills to take. I don't ask many questions. Is not my way.
DOCTOR: Okay, sugar was okay, cholesterol unknown. And you mentioned a little white pill for your blood pressure, do you remember anything about it?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It is small, round. White. And… the bottle is blue, I think. Is not a big bottle. Ricardo gets it for me at the pharmacy. He knows which one. I just take it every morning with my coffee. I don't know if it helps, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, small, round, white pill, blue bottle... We can look that up later. Now, let’s talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother, she had a very bad heart. She was in the hospital many times. She had… a very fast heartbeat, I think. And my brother, he has high blood pressure too. He takes pills, like me. My father… he was healthy, I think. Always working. Never sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart problems, brother with high blood pressure. And finally, can you tell me about anything else going on in your life?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing much. Ricardo and I, we are retired now. We like to garden. And go to church on Sundays. And… our granddaughter, Sofia, she is coming to visit next week. I am very excited. Is a long time since I see her. Is just… a normal life. Nothing exciting. Is good.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Sherion. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just take a general look. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. You can listen to my heart, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 88. Your pulse is regular at 72. Listening to your heart… I hear a slight murmur. It’s not a loud one, but it’s there. And your lungs sound clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles.
PATIENT: A murmur? What is a murmur, Doctor? Is that bad? Is that why my chest hurts?
DOCTOR: A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes. Most murmurs are harmless – it just means the blood is flowing through your heart valves a little differently. But it's good to know about it, so we can keep an eye on it. It's possible it could be related to your chest discomfort, but it's hard to say for sure. That’s why I want to do a couple of tests. Would you be okay with getting an EKG – that’s a quick test that checks your heart’s electrical activity?
PATIENT: An EKG? What does that involve, Doctor? Do you… poke me with needles? I don’t like needles. And is it expensive? I have Medicare, but… I don’t want to cause problems.
DOCTOR: No needles at all, Sherion, don't worry! An EKG is completely painless. It just involves sticking a few small patches – electrodes – on your chest, arms, and legs. Those patches pick up the electrical signals from your heart, and a machine records them. It takes only a few minutes. And Medicare should cover it, especially given your symptoms and the murmur I heard. We’ll double-check with the billing department to be sure, of course, but I don't anticipate any issues. Would you like to go ahead with that now?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles, you say? And Medicare covers it? Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. If it is not painful, and it helps you see what is wrong, then yes. Let’s do the test. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, we’re going to get you set up here. It will just take a few moments. The technician will explain everything as she goes. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and decide on the best plan of action.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you.
