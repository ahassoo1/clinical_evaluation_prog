DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's rather simple. I woke up yesterday and… well, I can't hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy on that same side. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Yesterday… you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday morning. August 1st, to be precise. I remember because it was market day, and I couldn't even hear the vendors trying to sell me their tomatoes. Honestly, the inefficiency of it all. Is this going to take long? I have a rather full schedule.
DOCTOR: August 1st… okay. And it was sudden onset?
PATIENT: Yes, sudden. I went to bed perfectly fine, and woke up… this. It wasn't a gradual thing. One minute I could hear, the next, nothing. It's not like I was exposed to any loud noises or anything. I haven't been near a construction site in weeks. Really quite baffling, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Baffling, yes. Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms since then?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… my balance has been a little off, I suppose. Nothing major, just a bit wobbly when I stand up quickly. And a slight headache, mostly on the side with the… problem. But I get headaches. It's probably just stress. I haven't had a fever or anything like that, if that's what you were going to ask. Honestly, I just want to know when I'll be able to hear again.
DOCTOR: Right. No fever… headache, balance issues. Okay. Ms. Nissenbaum, I’m going to need to do a quick examination. It’s important to rule out… a few things. Can you please sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, all this poking and prodding. It’s rather undignified. But fine. Straight as I can be. Just… please be quick about it. I do have appointments. And try not to touch my hair, if possible. It's just been styled.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your ears. I'm just going to take a look inside… Hmm. And can you tell me if you're experiencing any dizziness or vertigo when I move your head?
PATIENT: Dizziness… a little, yes, when I turn my head to the left. Not a spinning sensation, exactly, more of a… sway. It's quite annoying. Is something physically wrong with my ear? Because frankly, if it is, I'd like to know. And if it's treatable. Don't tell me it's something permanent. I have far too much going on to deal with permanent hearing loss.
DOCTOR: Alright. Smile for me, please. And raise and lower your eyebrows. Okay. Now, stick your tongue out. Hmm… Ms. Nissenbaum, I'm concerned about some weakness on the left side of your face. And, based on what you’ve told me, and this brief exam, it’s important to rule out a neurological issue.
PATIENT: Neurological issue? What exactly does that mean? Is it serious? I don’t like the sound of that at all. You're telling me my face is weak? Well, of course it is! That's why I'm here. But a neurological issue… I don't have time for neurological issues. Is it going to require… hospitalisation? Because I assure you, that's simply not an option. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, it's too early to say definitively. However, your symptoms—the sudden hearing loss, facial weakness, balance issues—could indicate something called Bell’s palsy, or, less commonly, a stroke. We need to determine which it is. The best course of action, and I strongly advise this, is to go to the nearest emergency room for a CT scan and evaluation by a neurologist. It’s important to rule out a stroke immediately.
PATIENT: A stroke?! Absolutely not. I do not need a CT scan. I'm perfectly capable of thinking clearly, aren't I? And I certainly don’t need to sit in a hospital waiting room with… people. I'm a radiologist, for goodness sake! I know about scans. I’ve seen them. This is likely just some… inner ear infection, or… something minor. I'll take some rest, drink some fluids, and see if it improves. Honestly, you're being rather alarmist. I don't appreciate it. I think I'll get a second opinion. And frankly, I’m wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concerns, but I’m obligated to advise you based on my professional medical judgment. Disregarding these symptoms could have serious consequences. I have documented my concerns and recommendations in your chart. I strongly urge you to reconsider going to the emergency room. I cannot stress enough the importance of ruling out a stroke. I am sorry you feel this way. I wish you all the best. .
