DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit of a hassle, but I need a letter. My travel insurance – Medicare, actually – needs a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for a trip I’m planning, and they’re being… particular. I lost my husband last year, and I’m trying to go visit some family overseas. It’s important to me, but this letter is holding things up.
DOCTOR: A letter. Of course. While I understand the emotional component, Medicare requiring such documentation for international travel seems… unusual. Nevertheless. To properly complete this request – and to fulfill my medical obligation to assess your fitness for travel – I will need some information. First, are you currently under the care of any other physicians?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Not currently. After… after my husband passed, I switched primary care doctors once, but I haven’t seen anyone regularly since then. Just… check-ups when needed, you know? Nothing ongoing. Is that a problem? Should I have been seeing someone? I didn’t realize it was required.
DOCTOR: "Required" is a strong word, Ms. Sayar. Prudent is more accurate. Maintaining consistent medical oversight is… advisable. But we won’t dwell on past choices. Let’s focus on the present. Have you experienced any recent illnesses – even minor ones – within the last six months?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had a cold back in February, I think it was. Just a regular cold. Runny nose, sore throat… lasted about a week. Took some over-the-counter stuff, rested, and it went away. Other than that… nothing. I’m usually pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well and get enough sleep when I can. Is a cold something I need to worry about for the letter?
DOCTOR: A “regular cold” can sometimes exacerbate underlying conditions, Ms. Sayar. We must be thorough. Do you have any chronic medical problems – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t have any chronic conditions at all. My husband… he had a bit of high blood pressure, but I don’t. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. I’m not on any medications either. Just… vitamins sometimes. Does that help? I’m trying to be as helpful as possible, I just… I really want to get this letter sorted.
DOCTOR: Vitamins are… inconsequential. Let's proceed. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything and haven't had a reaction. My husband was allergic to peanuts, so I’m always careful around those, but I’m not allergic myself. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and haven’t had any issues with pollen or anything like that either. Truly, I don’t have any known allergies. Is this taking a long time? I have a flight to book, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, proper medical assessment requires diligence, not expediency. Very well. Have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very fortunate, truly. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. It healed perfectly. I’ve never needed anything serious, thankfully. Is there anything else you need to know? Perhaps we can get to the letter itself now? I’m starting to worry about prices going up.
DOCTOR: “Thankfully” implies a degree of luck, Ms. Sayar, rather than proactive health management. Regardless. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke. I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve never had any interest in that sort of thing. I lead a pretty quiet life, honestly. I try to be healthy and responsible. Are we getting closer to the letter now? I really appreciate you taking the time, Doctor, but I do have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Very well. A brief physical examination is necessary, despite your insistence on a lack of medical issues. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your general condition. Please sit back, and relax. Breathing appears normal. Heart rate is… within acceptable parameters. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Not ideal, but acceptable. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Not at all. I sometimes get a little anxious when I’m stressed, but that’s it. No shortness of breath, no chest pain, no palpitations. Everything feels… normal, really. I walk quite a bit, actually. Try to get exercise whenever I can. Is that enough? Do you think you have enough information now to write the letter? I’m just… a little worried about the cost of the flight if I have to wait much longer.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, while your description is… reassuring, it is insufficient for a comprehensive medical assessment. However, given your age and the lack of any significant findings, and purely to expedite this matter, I can draft a letter stating that you are cleared for air travel based on the limited information available. Please understand this is not a comprehensive evaluation and does not absolve you of responsibility for informing the airline of any pre-existing conditions. Here is the letter. Please review it carefully. I strongly advise you schedule a full physical examination with a primary care physician upon your return. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… wonderful. Yes, it says everything I need. I really appreciate you fitting me in and getting this done so quickly. I will definitely schedule a check-up when I get back. I promise. This just… allows me to go and see my family. It means a lot. No, I don't think I have any other questions. Thank you again, Doctor Mutnick. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Ensure you have a safe journey, Ms. Sayar. And do schedule that examination. .
