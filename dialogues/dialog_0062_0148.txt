DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Um… well, this is a little embarrassing, to be honest. It’s… pain. Down there. It’s been… bothering me for a bit now. I’m not quite sure how long, exactly. It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, no need to be embarrassed at all. It's very common for women to experience pain in that area, and we're here to figure out what's going on. “Down there” is perfectly fine – we can get more specific as we talk. When you say “bothering you for a bit now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A rough estimate… hmm. You know, it feels like… maybe a couple of weeks? Or perhaps a month? It's difficult. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? It wasn't sudden, it just sort of… started. A dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: You’re right, time does slip away! A couple of weeks to a month is helpful. A dull ache... okay. And is this ache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Not all the time. Some days I barely notice it. Other days… …other days it’s more… prominent. Especially when I’ve been… moving around a lot. Or lifting things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it seems to be worse with activity. Does anything relieve the pain, or make it feel better?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Resting helps, I suppose. When I’m just… sitting quietly. And… warm baths. A warm bath always feels nice. I don’t know if it actually helps the pain, but it’s comforting.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and warm baths provide some comfort, that's good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Now that you mention it… maybe a little… swelling? It’s hard to tell. I haven't really… looked closely, if you understand what I mean. It just feels… different down there sometimes, not just the ache.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's not always easy to self-examine. A little swelling along with the ache. And has there been any change in your usual bathroom habits – anything different with urination or bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You’re asking very personal questions, Doctor! I apologize. No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal, in that regard. Truly. I haven't had any… difficulty.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. These questions are important for understanding what might be going on, and it's perfectly normal to feel a bit uncomfortable discussing them. I appreciate you being open with me. Now, have you experienced any vaginal discharge that's different than usual – different color, odor, or amount?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Um… now that you mention it… perhaps a little more discharge than usual? But I… I honestly don't pay a lot of attention to that sort of thing. It’s not anything alarming, I don’t think. Just… a little bit more. It’s clear, I believe. I don't recall any odor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more clear discharge than usual, no odor. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions – anything you've been diagnosed with or treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago, I think it was 2018. And… I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but I take medication for it. Other than that… nothing major, I don't believe. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in 2018 and high blood pressure managed with medication. Good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a multivitamin, I think. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains. But nothing regularly, really. Just when I need it. And… oh! I occasionally take something for sleep, but it’s very mild.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and a mild sleep aid occasionally. Have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: I… believe that was the only one. No, no other surgeries. I haven’t really been one for hospitals, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Is there a history of any significant illnesses – like cancer, heart disease, or reproductive issues – in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… My mother had… well, she had breast cancer, many years ago. She's passed now, unfortunately. And my sister has some sort of… autoimmune disorder, I think. It’s all a bit complicated. I'm not very close to my family, so I don't know all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had breast cancer and your sister has an autoimmune disorder. That's helpful information. Now, what about social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… What sort of things are you asking about? I’m… not sure I understand.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. Social history just means things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or do any recreational drugs. It also includes things like your job, your living situation, and your general level of activity. We just want to get a full picture of your life. Do you currently smoke?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no, never. I’ve never been a smoker. It’s a terrible habit, in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. But just one. And not every night, certainly. Maybe… twice a week? It’s… a little indulgence. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine maybe twice a week. And how about recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very clear. And finally, can you tell me a little about your job and your living situation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’m a woodworker. I mostly do… small repairs. Furniture, things like that. I like working with my hands. And I live alone, in a little cottage just outside of town. It’s quiet and peaceful. That's what I like about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a woodworker living alone in a cottage. That sounds lovely. Now, to finish up with your medical history, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... I don't think so. No, no known allergies. I’ve never had any reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. I have a little bit of a sensitivity to certain perfumes, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just makes me sneeze.
DOCTOR: No, that's not an allergy. Okay, so no known allergies. Thank you, Noelani, for all that information. Now, I'm going to ask to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your abdomen. After that, I'll need to do a pelvic exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll use a speculum and take a sample, if that's okay with you. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but there's a little tenderness in the lower abdomen. Now, for the pelvic exam. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Okay, I've completed the pelvic exam. I noticed some mild inflammation, and the sample I took will be sent to the lab for analysis. Based on the examination, it's likely there is some local irritation or a possible mild infection. However, we'll need the lab results to confirm.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. It… wasn’t as bad as I feared. An infection, you say? I hadn’t really considered that. How long will the results take? And… what sort of treatment would that involve, if it is an infection?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad it wasn’t as uncomfortable as you anticipated. It's good to rule things out and get to the bottom of it. The lab results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. If it is an infection, treatment usually involves a course of antibiotics. Depending on the type of infection, it could be a pill you take orally or a cream you apply topically. We'll know more once the results are in. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sexual activity, and I suggest keeping the area clean and dry. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can also help with any discomfort. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense. Avoiding… that, keeping it clean. Pain relievers. It sounds… manageable. Three to five days, you said? Alright. I think I understand. Will the results be sent to my home? Or do I need to come back for another appointment? I don't… I don't have a lot of transportation.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and I'm glad you asked. We'll contact you by phone to let you know when the results are available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in person, but it’s not strictly necessary if getting here is difficult. We can certainly discuss them over the phone if you prefer. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule a follow-up appointment just in case, or would you prefer to wait and see what the results say first?
PATIENT: Oh… I think… I think waiting is best, Doctor. If the results are clear, I’m sure we can manage a phone call. Scheduling an appointment now just… feels a bit premature, doesn’t it? I’d rather not bother if it’s not needed.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Noelani. We'll absolutely proceed that way. So, to recap: We’re waiting for lab results, which will take 3-5 business days. We'll call you with the results, and we can discuss them over the phone. In the meantime, try to avoid sexual activity, keep the area clean and dry, and use over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient. It really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like a fever, severe pain, or unusual discharge—please don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care of yourself, and I'll be in touch soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor. Thank you again. Goodbye.
