DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It…smells. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband certainly made that clear before he left. I just need something to fix it, quickly. I don’t have time for a whole song and dance about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re addressing it. Bad breath can be really bothersome, and thankfully, there are usually things we can do to help. Just so I can get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when you noticed it started?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really remember when exactly. It's just…always been a bit of a problem, I guess. It's probably gotten worse recently, now that I’m doing…this job. All that dust and stuff. Does that matter? I really just need a spray or something, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, the dust could be a factor. And don't worry, we can certainly explore some quick solutions like sprays, but I want to make sure we aren’t missing anything else. When you say “this job,” what do you do?
PATIENT: Highway maintenance. It’s…exactly what it sounds like. Lots of being outside, lots of dirt, fixing potholes, that sort of thing. It’s not glamorous. Look, I don't have time to describe my whole life story. Is bad breath a common thing for people who do…manual labor? I just figured it was the dirt.
DOCTOR: It can be more common with physical labor, yes, due to things like dehydration, mouth breathing, and, as you said, exposure to dust and debris. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I just know it smells awful. I guess my mouth feels a little dry sometimes, especially at the end of the day. Does that count? I don't really go to the doctor, so I don't know what's "normal." I just want this fixed, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry mouth is good to know. That can definitely contribute to bad breath. Let’s do a quick check of your mouth. Just open wide for me, please. I'm going to take a look at your tongue and gums. Hmm, your gums look a little inflamed, and I see some plaque buildup. Do you brush twice a day?
PATIENT: Yeah, I brush. Sometimes. Okay, usually twice a day. It depends, you know? Some days are busier than others. I don't really see the point of all that flossing stuff either. It just gets stuck. Is that the problem? Just a little plaque? Can you just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like improved oral hygiene could definitely help. The plaque and inflammation are likely contributors. We can talk about better brushing and flossing techniques, and I can recommend a good mouthwash. But before we do that, I want to quickly rule out anything else. Have you had any dental check-ups recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Last time I went to the dentist was…well, before the divorce, probably. I don’t like dentists. They poke around too much. Honestly, is this going to take all day? I have a shift starting in a few hours. I just need something fast, like a miracle spray or something. Is there anything like that?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I wish there was a miracle spray! But unfortunately, bad breath usually has a cause, and treating the cause is more effective than masking the smell. Since you haven’t seen a dentist recently, I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. It's possible there's something going on with your teeth or gums that we need to address. In the meantime, we can try a therapeutic mouthwash and I'll give you some tips to improve your oral hygiene routine. But please, don’t delay seeing a dentist. Would you like me to write you a referral?
PATIENT: Fine. A referral. Whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. It's just bad breath. I doubt it's anything serious. And don’t bother with a long list of instructions, okay? Just the mouthwash. The fastest, strongest one you've got. I need to go. I have stuff to do. .
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm writing you a referral to a dentist nearby. It’s important to get this checked out, Zelina. And I’ll write you a prescription for a chlorhexidine mouthwash - it’s a strong one, as you requested, but it can stain your teeth if used for too long, so please follow the instructions carefully. Use it for two weeks, then stop unless the dentist tells you otherwise. Brush twice a day, drink plenty of water, and try to avoid mouth breathing as much as possible. Do you have any questions before you go?
