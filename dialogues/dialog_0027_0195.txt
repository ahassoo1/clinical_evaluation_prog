DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's not really something wrong, you understand. Just… well, my daughter, she thinks I need a little… encouragement. A card from a real doctor, she said. A "Get Well" card, even though I am well. Mostly. It’s just… life, you know? A little pick-me-up. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A… preventative wellness check, spurred by your daughter’s concern. That’s very thoughtful of her. “Life,” yes, I see many cases of that. And it's good to be proactive. Just to be thorough, even if you feel mostly well, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Going on? Honestly, Doctor, nothing specific. That's the whole point! It’s not like my knee is hurting or I have a cough. It's just… getting older, I suppose. My bones ache sometimes, but everyone my age aches. And I worry about my son, he’s always traveling for work. That sort of thing. It’s just… a general feeling. You know? I just thought a nice card might cheer me up a bit. Is that so hard to understand? Some people get flowers, I thought a card from you would be nice.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s perfectly reasonable. Sometimes a little reassurance is what’s needed. And it’s good to address these things, even if they aren’t… a specific illness. “General feeling” is a good place to start. To help me understand a little better, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Well, I’m not running marathons, if that’s what you mean. I get tired, of course. I’m sixty! I used to be able to garden all day, now I have to sit down every hour or so. But that’s just… age creeping up on me, isn’t it? I still manage the house, cook for my husband… I’m not bedridden, Doctor. Honestly, I feel like you’re looking for something that isn’t there. It’s just a little… low spirits, I suppose. Is a card really so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. A card is perfectly reasonable. I just want to rule out anything that could be contributing to these feelings. It sounds like you’re still very active, which is wonderful. The change in your gardening stamina is helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, dear. Sleep is…patchy. I wake up a lot during the night. Thinking about things, mostly. My son, the house… everything. My husband snores like a… well, you don’t want to know. But I get by. I always have. Appetite… that’s alright, I think. I enjoy my cooking, still. I make a lovely dal bhat, if you've ever tried Nepalese food. Better than anything you’d get in a restaurant, I assure you. But I’m not eating more or anything, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s just… normal sixty-year-old things, isn’t it? Are we getting anywhere with this card?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. You’re very helpful, thank you. Patchy sleep and waking up thinking… that’s more information. It's good to know you are still enjoying your appetite. Now, let's just go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional weight loss? Doctor, are you trying to find a disease? I told you, I eat well! My husband complains I cook too much! I haven’t lost any weight. If anything, I’ve… well, maybe gained a little. It’s hard to say, but certainly not lost any. This is getting ridiculous. I just want a card. A nice “Get Well” card to cheer me up. It’s not asking the world, is it? I'm starting to feel quite… frustrated, actually.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right. I apologize. I’m just trying to be thorough, and it sounds like you’ve been very clear. No weight loss, good. And I completely understand your frustration. Let’s change tack. Just out of curiosity, have you noticed any changes in your mood recently, besides the general low spirits you mentioned?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? Well, I get annoyed easily, I suppose. My daughter, always worrying. My son, never calling enough. My husband, leaving his socks everywhere! It’s the little things, Doctor! It’s not like I’m… depressed or anything. Just… a little irritable. A sixty-year-old woman with a lot on her mind, that’s all. Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated! Is it really so hard to just write a card? A kind word from a doctor, that’s all I ask. You’re making this much more complicated than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: You are right to call me out on that. I apologize again. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of everyday stressors, and it's perfectly normal to feel irritable. It sounds like you’re very resilient, and you’re managing a lot. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be sure everything is as it should be. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Just a routine check, okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? For a card? I came here for a "Get Well" card, not a check-up! This is… utterly ridiculous. I’m not going to lie on a table and let you poke and prod me. I'm perfectly healthy, as I've told you repeatedly. If you're not going to write a card, just say so. I’ll go somewhere else. This is wasting my time. And frankly, it's quite insulting. I think I’ve made my point. .
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. I completely understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize for putting you through this. I was being… overly thorough, and it seems I completely missed the point of your visit. I will absolutely write you a "Get Well" card, with a kind message. I apologize again for wasting your time and making you feel insulted. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
