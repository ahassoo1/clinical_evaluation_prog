DOCTOR: Right, Marija Chilla, age 44. Hello, I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is…Chilla, yes. My husband suggested I come. He’s been quite insistent, actually. He says we need to…have things in order. I believe he means one of those forms, a…a directive, or a POLST, as he calls it. Something about what happens if…well, if something should happen. I confess, I haven't the faintest idea what it all entails, but he seems very worried.
DOCTOR: Right. A POLST form, or a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. Your husband is thinking ahead, I suppose. It's essentially a document outlining your wishes for medical care if you become unable to speak for yourself. It’s…practical. A lot of people don’t think about it until it’s too late. Before we get into that, though, are you experiencing any health concerns currently?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Not particularly. I mean, one gets a little…stiff after a long day of lecturing, naturally. And the dust in the city isn't kind to one’s sinuses. But nothing…serious. I assure you, Doctor, I am a perfectly healthy woman. It’s simply this…fuss my husband is making. He always does overthink things, you see. Still, he insisted I come and “get it sorted.” So here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. "A little stiff," you said. And sinuses affected by the city dust. Okay. Just to be clear, when you say “stiff”, where exactly are you feeling that?
PATIENT: Well, my back, mostly. Lower back, really. And sometimes my neck. It’s nothing debilitating, I assure you. It simply requires…adjustments. A good massage usually does the trick. I used to swim regularly, you see, but finding the time…it’s difficult. The university schedule is quite demanding. I suppose I should prioritize it more, but one has papers to grade, lectures to prepare… it’s a constant struggle, frankly. Is this…relevant to the directive? I thought we were here to discuss that form.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, actually. It’s important to have a complete picture. We’re not just talking about end-of-life wishes here, we’re assessing your overall health. Knowing about any ongoing discomfort, even if you manage it yourself, helps me understand your baseline. So, this back and neck stiffness…how long has it been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, for years, really. On and off. It flares up when I’m particularly stressed, or if I’ve been grading papers for too long in a poor posture. Honestly, it's been a nuisance for as long as I can remember. I’ve never bothered a doctor with it. A bit of stretching, a hot bath…it’s always been sufficient. Are you suggesting this…stiffness is somehow a serious issue? Because I assure you, Doctor, I am quite capable of managing my own health. My mother always said a strong back is the sign of a strong woman, and I've always prided myself on my constitution.
DOCTOR: Right. "Years, on and off.” Okay. And you’ve never sought any professional treatment for it – no physical therapy, chiropractic care, or even over-the-counter pain relief?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Absolutely none. Honestly, Doctor, I find the whole thing rather…unnecessary. I’ve always preferred natural remedies. A good rest, a bit of herbal tea… those are far more effective than any pill or…manipulation. I wouldn't want to burden the healthcare system with something so trivial. Besides, my husband worries enough as it is. I don’t need to give him another reason to fuss. We came to discuss the directive, if you recall. Are we getting any closer to that? I have a faculty meeting this afternoon, and I’m already running rather late.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Just for the record, you've had this back and neck stiffness for years, managed it with rest and herbal tea, and have never sought medical attention for it. Before we move on to the POLST form, I’m going to need to ask a few more general health questions. It’s standard procedure. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I pride myself on my good health. I eat a sensible diet, I try to get enough sleep – although the university schedule makes that difficult, as I mentioned – and I lead a reasonably active life. I walk to campus every day, you know. It’s a good walk, quite brisk. No, I have never been diagnosed with anything…chronic. My mother always said a strong constitution is the key to a long and healthy life, and I’ve always taken that to heart. Really, Doctor, I think my husband is being overly cautious. Perhaps we should simply fill out the form and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Alright. You have no chronic conditions. You walk to campus. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father had…heart trouble, I believe. It was quite sudden, actually. He was a very robust man, you see, always active. It was a shock to everyone. My mother, she… she suffered from migraines. Terrible, debilitating migraines. She was quite frail, to be honest. But other than that… nothing significant comes to mind. We weren’t a particularly medical family, you see. We preferred to…manage things ourselves. Really, Doctor, I don’t think there’s much more to say on that front. Can we please get to the directive now? I have a very important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Father had heart trouble, mother had migraines. Have you ever had an EKG or any other cardiac testing?
PATIENT: Cardiac testing? Goodness, no. Absolutely not. Why would I? I feel perfectly fine. As I said, I walk to campus every day, and I don't experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… unnecessary. I came here to discuss a directive, not to undergo a full medical examination. I assure you, my heart is perfectly healthy. Really, I think my husband is…overreacting. Can we please, please, get to the form now? I’m starting to feel quite anxious. This is wasting my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Right. So, just to summarize: you’ve had back and neck stiffness for years, managed with rest, no medical attention sought. Your father had heart trouble, your mother had migraines. You’ve never had any cardiac testing, and you feel “perfectly fine.” Before we proceed with the POLST form, I need to advise you that given your family history of heart trouble, it would be prudent to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I recommend an EKG and possibly a consultation with a cardiologist. I’m not comfortable signing a POLST form without a more thorough assessment of your cardiovascular health. It would be irresponsible of me.
PATIENT: Are you…are you refusing to help me? My husband specifically requested this form, and you are…insisting on unnecessary tests? This is…outrageous. I came here for a simple administrative matter, and you are now attempting to…diagnose me with something I do not have? Honestly, I have never encountered such…condescension. I am a highly educated woman, and I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions regarding my health. I think I will seek a second opinion. A doctor who respects my autonomy, and doesn’t attempt to…impose their own anxieties upon me. Good day, Doctor. .
