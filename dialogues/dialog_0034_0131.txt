DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mykeisha. Well, it's my blood pressure, really. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister – she's a nurse – told me I should get it checked out. She gets worried, that one.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mykeisha. It’s good of you to come in and get it checked, especially with your sister’s concern. We want to make sure everything is alright. To start, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed your blood pressure being higher?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started maybe… three, four months ago? I didn't really pay it much mind at first, 'cause sometimes it just goes up if I'm stressed, you know? But it's been happening more often, even when I’m not feeling particularly worried. I noticed it mostly when I went to get a flu shot at the pharmacy, the nurse there said it was a little high.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months ago, and you noticed it particularly at the pharmacy when getting your flu shot. And it seems to be happening more frequently even when you aren’t feeling stressed. That’s helpful information. Can you recall what the reading was at the pharmacy, if they told you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, they did actually! Let me see... it was 142 over 90, I think. The nurse wrote it down on a little card for me. I still have it somewhere in my purse... Just a minute... Ah, here it is! Yes, 142 over 90, on May 15th.
DOCTOR: Thank you for finding that card, Mykeisha. That is a good reference point. 142 over 90 is certainly elevated. Do you happen to know what your typical blood pressure reading is when it's normal, or have you had it checked regularly before this?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I haven't been to the doctor in… oh gosh, it must be five or six years? I usually feel fine, so I don't bother. My sister always tells me I should go more often, but… well, life gets in the way, you know? I’ve never really needed to get it checked before, so I don’t have any old readings to compare it to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for people to only see a doctor when they’re feeling unwell. It's good that you're addressing it now. Alright, since we don't have a baseline reading, we'll get one today. I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then I’d like to ask you a few questions about your health history and lifestyle. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to answer any questions you have. Just let me know when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just relax your arm here for me, please. I’ll let you know when I start. And don’t worry if it feels a little tight – it needs to be snug to get an accurate reading. Okay, taking your blood pressure now. Just try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, I’m trying to relax. It is a bit snug, but I'm okay. Just let me know what you find out.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure readings are 158 over 92 and 160 over 94. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. These readings are elevated, confirming your sister’s concerns and the reading at the pharmacy. We need to investigate this further to determine the cause and develop a plan. Do you have any pain, dizziness, or vision changes currently?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. Those are high, aren’t they? No, thankfully, no pain or dizziness. My vision's been fine, too. I haven't noticed anything different there. I have been a little more tired than usual lately, but I just figured that was from working too much. I work at a few different places, helping people with… well, just everyday things, you know? Cleaning, cooking, errands... I keep pretty busy. Is that tiredness something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you don’t have any pain, dizziness, or vision changes. The tiredness could be related to the high blood pressure, or it could be from your busy schedule. It's hard to say at this point. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask you some questions about your health history and lifestyle. First, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been pretty healthy, actually. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no kidney problems, nothing like that. My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, but she didn’t get diagnosed until she was in her seventies. And my dad was fine as a fiddle all his life. Oh, wait… I did have gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with my son, but that went away after the baby was born. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your general health and your family history. And yes, gestational diabetes is important information, even though it resolved after pregnancy. It does increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils taken out, but that was ages ago. And I was in the hospital for a couple of days when I had my son, but that was a normal delivery, nothing complicated. Other than that, no surgeries or hospital stays. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can!
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And I use ibuprofen occasionally if I have a headache, but that's it. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. I believe in letting my body heal itself, you know? I don’t like filling it up with things it doesn’t need.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, besides trying to avoid pills, as I said! I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My sister always jokes that I have a cast-iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, like I said, I work a lot. I work part-time cleaning houses, and then I do errands and cooking for a few elderly folks in the neighborhood. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure. I don’t have a lot of time for hobbies or anything like that. I live alone, and my son lives a few states away, so it’s mostly just me. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes it's hard when you're running around all day. I do like to cook Caribbean food, though! It's usually pretty healthy stuff, lots of fish and vegetables. And I try to walk when I can, but I don’t really have a regular exercise routine. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mykeisha. Thank you for sharing that. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not even a sip of alcohol. I don't smoke, and I definitely don't do drugs. My mom didn't drink or smoke, and she raised me to stay away from all that. I just don't have any interest. I prefer a good cup of tea, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear. One final question regarding your lifestyle: how would you describe your stress levels typically?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I guess they’re… moderate? Work can be stressful sometimes, especially when you're trying to juggle everything. And I worry about my son, even though he's grown. But I try not to let it get to me. I have my faith, and I try to take things one day at a time. I do get anxious sometimes, but I don’t dwell on things. I try to focus on the positive. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mykeisha. Thank you for being so open with me. Okay, based on what you've told me, your blood pressure is elevated, and we need to investigate further. Given your history, I would like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. I also want to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood tests and an EKG… okay. Just let me know when and where I need to go. I just want to figure out what's going on and get this sorted out, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, and the EKG machine is in the room next door. I’ll write you a requisition form for the blood tests, and the technician will be able to guide you through the process. After the tests, you can come back to me, and we can discuss the results. In the meantime, I would recommend making some lifestyle changes to help lower your blood pressure. This includes reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly, and managing your stress levels. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds manageable. Salt, fruits, exercise, stress… I can work on that. I do enjoy cooking, so I can try to use less salt. And I’ll try to walk more. I guess I need to make more time for myself, too. What about stress? Do you have any tips for managing that? I do pray, but sometimes it's hard to quiet my mind.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. Prayer is an excellent starting point. Beyond that, there are several techniques that can help manage stress. Deep breathing exercises can be very effective – simply taking slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system. Mindfulness meditation, even for just a few minutes each day, can also be helpful. And if you find your stress is overwhelming, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. There’s no shame in seeking help. We also have resources here at the clinic if you're interested. I can give you a handout with some stress-management techniques and a list of local counselors. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That handout sounds wonderful, thank you. And I appreciate you mentioning the counselors. I might look into that if things don’t get better. I think I’m good for now, Doctor. Just let me know when the lab technician is ready, and I’ll go get the blood tests done. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could help. I’ll let the technician know you’re ready when they’re available. It shouldn’t be too long. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to support you. We'll get those results back quickly and formulate a plan. Have a good day, Mykeisha.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. I’ll see you when the results are back.
