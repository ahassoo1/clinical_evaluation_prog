DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Decosta, nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been… forgetting things. Not like, huge important things all the time, but little stuff. It's been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're bringing it up – it's definitely worth looking into, and it’s not embarrassing at all. Lots of things can cause memory changes. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "little stuff"?
PATIENT: Well, like… I went to the grocery store yesterday and completely forgot what I went in for. I just stood there for a few minutes, trying to remember. And then this morning, I couldn’t recall what I had for breakfast. It's things like that. Mostly recent stuff, I think. It doesn’t feel like long-term memories are going, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, it sounds like recent memory is the main concern. And it's not a complete blank – you know you went to the grocery store, just not what you needed?
PATIENT: Exactly! Yeah, I remember doing things, usually. It's just…the details are fuzzy. Like, if you asked me about my childhood, I could probably tell you stories all day. But what I had for lunch? Who knows. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I completely understand how frustrating that can be. Okay, let’s try to get a bit more information. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to start suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… gradual? It’s hard to say exactly. I feel like maybe a few months ago I started noticing it a little more. It wasn’t huge at first, just little things, but it's definitely gotten more noticeable recently. I don’t think it was one specific day that it started, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Gradual onset is helpful to know. And besides the forgetting, have you noticed any other changes – things like difficulty with words, trouble with directions, changes in your mood, or feeling more confused than usual?
PATIENT: No, not really. Words are fine, thankfully. And I haven’t gotten lost or anything. My mood… well, I’m a little anxious because of this, but I wouldn’t say my mood has changed generally. Just…worried. I don't think I’m more confused than usual, just forgetful. Actually, now that I think about it, I have been a little more tired lately. But I thought that was just work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. Increased fatigue is definitely worth noting. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu last winter, but that's it. I’m generally pretty healthy. I do take a daily multivitamin, but no other medications. Oh! And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No major medical problems, just the appendix removal years ago and the flu. Any family history of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she got pretty confused towards the end of her life. I don’t know if it was Alzheimer’s or just old age, honestly. Nobody really talked about it much. And my father’s side… I don’t really know. We weren’t very close, and I don’t know much about their medical history. So, maybe a possibility on my mother’s side, but I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A possible family history on your mother’s side is worth keeping in mind. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I try to be pretty healthy, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear. And how’s your sleep been lately?
PATIENT: Well, I said I've been more tired, right? I think I’m getting enough hours, usually around 7 or 8, but it’s not always good sleep. I toss and turn a bit. I don't wake up feeling particularly rested, if that makes sense. I think I’ve been a little stressed at work, and that probably isn’t helping.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some disrupted sleep and stress contributing to fatigue. Alright, Ebony, I’d like to do a quick physical and neurological exam, if that's okay with you. It will just involve checking your reflexes, balance, and doing some simple memory tests. It's nothing to worry about, just helps me get a better overall picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could sit here for me, we’ll start with some basic vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then we'll move onto the neurological exam. I’ll explain everything as we go. Okay, everything seems normal so far. Now, let’s do a quick memory test. I’m going to say three unrelated words. Please just listen to them carefully, and then I’ll ask you to recall them after a short delay. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions, just to keep your mind occupied. What year is it?
PATIENT: It’s… 2025.
DOCTOR: Correct. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: We’re… in Dr. Decosta's office, at the clinic. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Okay, now can you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Apple… and… oh dear. I’m blanking. I think… Table? And something with money? But I can't quite… Penny? Was Penny one of them? I’m so sorry, it’s right on the tip of my tongue.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. You remembered Apple and correctly identified that Penny was one of the words. It’s common to have some difficulty recalling things immediately, especially with a bit of stress. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your daily activities. Do you have any difficulty with tasks like managing your finances, taking medications, or following directions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I manage my own bills, and I take my multivitamin every morning without any problems. I haven't gotten lost or anything like that. I think… I think I'm still pretty capable. It’s just this…forgetfulness. It's not like I can't do things, just… remembering the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, there’s nothing that immediately jumps out as a major concern. However, given your concerns about memory changes, I think it’s worth running some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. These tests will check things like your thyroid function, vitamin levels , and glucose levels. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds like a good idea. I'd rather be safe than sorry. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do them.
DOCTOR: Great. I’ll write up the lab orders now. We’ll also do a basic urine test just to rule out a UTI, as that can sometimes cause confusion. The lab is just down the hall. Once you’ve completed the tests, you can come back, and we’ll discuss the results. It usually takes a few days to get them back. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce stress as much as possible. Things like regular exercise, getting enough sleep, and practicing relaxation techniques can all be helpful. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. Just… when should I expect the results? And will someone call me if anything urgent comes up? I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not just dismiss my concerns.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It's my job to listen and help figure things out. The results usually come back within 3-5 business days. Our office will call you with the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If anything urgent comes up, the lab will notify us immediately, and we will call you right away. Don't hesitate to call us if you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, such as confusion, dizziness, or weakness. Here’s a requisition form for the blood and urine tests. Do you have any difficulties getting to the lab, or would you like me to provide you with directions?
PATIENT: No, I think I can find it alright. It’s just down the hall, right? I appreciate the directions anyway. And thank you again, Dr. Decosta. I feel a lot better knowing we’re looking into this. I’ll go get the tests done now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you when the results are back.
