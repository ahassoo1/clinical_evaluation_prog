DOCTOR: Hi Percell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Hernandez, nice to meet you too. It’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, kinda feels like a tight band squeezin’ sometimes. Been botherin’ me for…oh, maybe a week now? Not terrible, but enough to make me notice it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about a week, mostly feeling like a tight band around the back of your head. I understand. Not terrible, but noticeable. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn't really come and go, it’s just… there. Most of the time it's a dull ache, but if I get really stressed, or if I bend over…that's when it really feels like someone’s tighten’ a rope around my skull. And it doesn’t feel like it’s on just one side, it’s pretty much the whole back of my head. I tried some over-the-counter stuff, like ibuprofen, but it barely touches it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's pretty constant, a dull ache across the back of the head, worsens with stress or bending over. Ibuprofen isn't providing much relief. Have you noticed anything that makes it better, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. When I lie down flat, it feels a little bit better. And… if I rub the back of my neck for a long time, that eases it up a bit, but it always comes back. Not a cure, just a little relief for a bit. I also noticed… when I’m really focused on somethin', like work, I forget about it sometimes. Then I look up and… there it is again.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat and neck massage offer temporary relief, and it seems to fade when you're concentrating. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, I had some headaches that felt similar. But they weren’t as constant as this one. Those would come and go, usually after a long day of workin' outside in the sun. I just figured it was dehydration or somethin’ back then. But this one… this one’s different. It’s just… always there, kinda naggin’ at me. It’s been a long time since I had a really bad headache like those older ones though, maybe 10 years or more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had similar headaches in the past, but they were intermittent and related to exertion or sun exposure. This one is more constant and doesn’t seem to have a clear trigger. Good to know. Now, Percell, I'm going to ask you some general health questions, if that's alright. Have you had any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s alright, go ahead. Hmm… let me think. No high blood pressure, no diabetes. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, got some arthritis in 'em, but that’s it. And my eyesight ain't what it used to be, need glasses, but that’s just gettin’ old, I guess. Never been a big hospital person, always tried to take care of myself, you know? So, haven't seen many doctors over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees, and some vision changes. Otherwise, generally healthy, and haven’t seen many doctors. That’s good information. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky that way, I guess. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, fallin' out of a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That was it. Nothing major. This headache is makin' me think maybe I should have seen a doctor sooner.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just a broken arm as a child. I understand your reluctance, but it's good you came in now. Let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, headaches, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… well, most of ‘em are back in Laos still. Didn’t see ‘em much growin’ up, even. My mother… she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, similar to my knees I reckon. And my father… he had a bad heart, I think. Didn’t live to be very old. But as for headaches… I don’t really recall anyone complainin’ about those. But it’s hard to say, we didn’t really talk about health much, not back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, some joint issues in your mother, and heart problems in your father. Not much history of headaches. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smokin’ for me. Never liked it. And I don't really drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner once in a while, that’s about it. Definitely no drugs. Always been a straight liver, as they say. I try to eat pretty healthy too, lots of vegetables, rice. I like to cook. I believe in takin’ care of myself, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs, and a healthy diet. That’s all very good. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I took some ibuprofen for this headache, like I said, and that didn’t bother me none. I’m pretty lucky that way, I reckon. Still, this headache is just… persistent. It’s wearin’ me down a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Percell, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Then we can talk about what might be causing this headache and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? This headache is makin' it hard to concentrate on my work. And I like to stay busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. It's a pretty standard procedure. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, Percell, everything sounds clear with your heart and lungs. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and sensation are also good. I didn’t notice anything concerning during the neurological exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 140 over 90, but that could be due to stress or simply being in the doctor's office. Based on everything you've told me, and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache. These are very common, and often related to stress, muscle tension, or even mild dehydration. However, because your blood pressure is a little high, and you’ve had this headache for a week without significant improvement, I want to be cautious. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying issues. We should get the results back within a few days. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. A complete blood count and a metabolic panel... that makes sense. I don’t mind gettin’ some tests done, if it helps figure things out. So, tension headache, you reckon? From stress, huh? Well, I have been worryin’ about my grandson lately, he’s havin’ some trouble in school. Maybe that’s it. Whatever it is, I’m glad I came in. Thank you, Doctor. What do I need to do next?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. It's good you came in, and it's perfectly reasonable to consider stress as a contributing factor, especially with concerns about your grandson. Okay, so the nurse will draw some blood before you leave today. We'll call you as soon as the results are back, usually within 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a few things. First, make sure you’re staying well-hydrated – drink plenty of water throughout the day. Second, try to manage your stress. Things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even just taking a few minutes each day to relax can be helpful. And finally, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the pain, but don’t take them consistently for more than a few days without talking to me first. If the headache gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just to see if that helps ease the tension. It's a low dose, and we can adjust it if needed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that all makes sense. Hydrate, manage stress, don't overdo the pain relievers, and watch for new symptoms. Muscle relaxant… that sounds good too, if it can ease up some of the tightness. I guess I don’t have any questions right now, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me. And thanks again for bein’ so thorough. Just hopin’ this is just stress, and that things will get better soon. I got a lot of things I want to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I understand. It's good you're proactive about your health, and I'm hopeful that this is just stress-related. We'll get the test results back soon and see what they show. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and go over the discharge instructions with you. Have a good day, Percell. And try to take it easy.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Hernandez. You too. I will. And I appreciate everything.
