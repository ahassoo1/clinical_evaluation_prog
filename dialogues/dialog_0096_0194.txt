DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, alright. Well, it’s… my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my family… there’s been some trouble with ears on my mother’s side, you see. It comes and goes, this… feeling. It’s hard to explain. Like everything’s spinning, and my ear just… stops working. Not all the time, thankfully. Just… episodes, I guess.
DOCTOR: Episodes, alright. Hmm. And how long have you been experiencing these episodes, Terasa?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. It feels like… a long time now. Maybe… a few years? It’s hard to put a finger on it, honestly. They didn't bother me too much at first, just a little off balance now and then. But they’ve been… more frequent lately, I think. It’s all a bit of a blur, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: A few years, alright. And you said more frequent lately… can you give me a sense of how often “lately” is?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Let me think. It used to be maybe once or twice a year, but now… maybe once a month? Sometimes more, sometimes less. It’s not regular, that’s for sure. It just… happens. And it always feels so sudden. Like a switch flips, you know?
DOCTOR: A switch flips… alright, I understand. And during these episodes, besides the spinning sensation and your ear feeling stopped up, do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… sometimes I get a bit nauseous. Not terribly, just… queasy. And a little bit of pressure in my ear, before it goes. Like… like something’s building up. And sometimes… a bit of ringing, a high-pitched whine. But that doesn't happen every time. It’s all a bit different each time, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, nausea, pressure, and ringing… that's helpful. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I wish I knew! No, not really. It just… happens. Sometimes I'm walking, sometimes I'm sitting and reading… doesn't seem to matter. I've tried to think about it, tried to see if there’s anything I do before it starts, but… nothing. It's very frustrating, to be honest. It makes me a bit anxious, worrying about when the next one will come.
DOCTOR: Anxious, alright, I understand. Well, it's good you're paying attention to it. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything, Terasa?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me see. Not that I recall, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. The doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high, but it wasn’t anything too serious, he said. And I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered well. Nothing… major, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, slightly elevated blood pressure and gallbladder removal. Do you take any medications currently, Terasa?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Just this one. For the blood pressure, you see. Lisinopril, it’s called. A small dose, the doctor said. And… that's it, really. I don't like taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm a pretty simple eater, really. No fancy foods, no shellfish or anything like that. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Terasa, let's talk about your family history. You mentioned trouble with ears on your mother’s side. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. It was… my aunt, mostly. She had terrible ear infections when she was a child, and then… she started having these spells, like I do. The dizziness, the hearing loss. She went to a lot of doctors, but they never really figured it out. She… she had trouble walking in her later years, and I always wondered if it was connected. And my cousin, on that side too, he’s had some ringing in his ears, he says. Nothing like what I’m experiencing, but… still. It worries me, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of ear issues and dizziness in your aunt, and tinnitus in your cousin. I see. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I’m retired now, mostly. I used to work at the… oh dear, what was it called? Something to do with games, with people placing bets. It's a bit of a blur now. I don’t do much these days, really. Mostly just stay home, read a bit, watch television. I try to get out for a walk when the weather is nice, but… I don’t have a lot of energy, these days. I live alone, since my husband passed away.
DOCTOR: Alright, retired, widowed, living alone. Now, Terasa, I'm going to need to do a quick examination of your ears, just to see if I can see anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, doctor. I just hope you find something. It’s been going on for so long, and it’s nice to finally be getting it looked at properly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm… there’s a little bit of cerumen buildup in both ears, but nothing significant. The tympanic membranes look… normal. No signs of infection or fluid. No tenderness. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a general assessment. Then, I'm going to have you follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll check your balance.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That’s… that’s good, I suppose. That there's nothing obvious. My heart has been a bit… fluttery sometimes, but it usually passes. And my balance… well, that’s why I’m here, isn’t it? I try to be careful when I walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, but not alarmingly so. It’s likely benign, but we can monitor it. Okay, and I’m observing some slight involuntary eye movements when you look to the sides. Now, stand up for me, if you can, and let’s do a quick balance test. Alright. You have a little difficulty with your balance, as expected. Now, before we get to figuring out a course of action, can you tell me if you've experienced any recent head trauma?
PATIENT: Oh… recent head trauma? No, not at all. I’m very careful, you see. I haven’t fallen or bumped my head… not recently, anyway. I had a little slip in the garden a few years back, but it wasn't very bad. Just a little bruise, that’s all. Nothing like… a proper head injury. I'm a bit clumsy, sometimes, but I always try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent significant head trauma. Terasa, based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, the most likely explanation for your symptoms is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo – BPPV. That means little crystals in your inner ear have become dislodged, causing dizziness when you change positions. It’s very common, especially as people get older. The involuntary eye movements I observed – the nystagmus – support that diagnosis. However, to be absolutely sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order an MRI of your brain. It’s just a precaution. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a series of exercises called the Epley maneuver. They can often reposition those crystals and alleviate your symptoms. Would you be comfortable trying those?
PATIENT: Oh… crystals in my ear? That sounds… odd. An MRI… is that… safe? I've heard things… And exercises… I’m not very good at exercises, you see. I get easily tired. But… if it might help… Yes, alright. I suppose I’m willing to try. But explain those exercises to me carefully, please. And tell me more about this MRI… what are you looking for, exactly? I don't want to do anything unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa. Let me address your concerns one at a time. The MRI is very safe. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. There’s no radiation involved. We’re looking to rule out any other potential causes of your dizziness, like a stroke or a tumor – these are rare, but it’s important to be thorough. Now, about the Epley maneuver. It’s a series of head positions that help move those crystals back into their proper location. It sounds complicated, but it’s actually quite simple. I'll show you a diagram and demonstrate it to you. It involves turning your head to the side while lying down, and then quickly sitting up. We'll start with one side, and then repeat it for the other side. You may feel a bit dizzy during the maneuver, but it should be temporary. It's important to do it correctly, so I’ll have one of the nurses observe you the first time. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… No radiation… that’s good. And it’s just to be safe… alright. The exercises… I’m still a bit worried about the dizziness, you see. I don't like feeling off balance. But… if you think it will help… and if someone can watch me… Yes, alright. Let's try it. Show me the diagram. And tell me… how long will it take to see if it’s working? I don’t want to get my hopes up, and then be disappointed. And... can I take something for the dizziness during the exercise?
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa, good. Now, it’s important to remember to move quickly and smoothly during each step. And, it’s best to have someone with you for the first few times. It is also best to do this maneuver before bedtime. Now, as for seeing if it works, it can vary. Some people feel immediate relief after one attempt. Others may need a few sessions. If it doesn’t work after a few attempts, we can discuss other options. And, yes, you can take an over-the-counter anti-nausea medication like meclizine beforehand, if you’re concerned about nausea. But try to avoid taking anything that could make you drowsy, just in case. The nurse will come in shortly to observe your first attempt. We’ll also schedule the MRI for next week. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. So, meclizine, and no getting sleepy. And the nurse will watch me… good. This turning part… is it a fast turn, or a slow turn? I’m worried about making it worse. And… what if it does make it worse? What do I do then? I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa. That's a very reasonable concern. The turn should be relatively quick, but controlled. Think of it as a smooth, brisk movement, not a jerky one. It is very important to have someone there to steady you during the maneuver, especially the first few times. Now, if it does make it worse, the dizziness should subside within a few minutes. If it doesn't, or if you experience any other symptoms like severe nausea, vomiting, or changes in vision, stop immediately and let me know. We'll re-evaluate at that point. We are starting with the least invasive option and monitoring closely. The nurse will explain everything again before you attempt it. She’s very experienced. Do you feel comfortable enough to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. As long as the nurse is experienced, and as long as I can stop if it gets too bad… Yes, alright. Let's get it over with. But… can you just double-check one more thing? Is it okay if I’m wearing my glasses during the exercise? I’m a bit unsteady without them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa, yes, it’s absolutely fine to wear your glasses during the exercise. In fact, it’s a good idea. Better to be safe and have clear vision. I'm glad you asked. The nurse should be here any moment now to assist you. She'll go through the whole procedure step-by-step and answer any further questions you may have. Remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, so don’t hesitate to voice your concerns. We'll take it one step at a time. Now, just relax and let the nurse guide you through it. Is there anything else I can do for you before she arrives?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so carefully. I’m still a bit worried, but… I feel a little better knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa. You’re very welcome. I understand your anxiety, and I’m here to support you through this. Don’t hesitate to ask questions at any point. I will step out now and let the nurse come in and get you started. Remember to take deep breaths, and focus on staying relaxed. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: .
