DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too. Uh… cough. I been coughin’. And… there’s stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. I smoke, you know. Been a while now. That’s… that’s why I’m here, I guess. Don’t remember much else about it, honestly. Just… coughin’ and the red.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. Coughing up red… that’s certainly something we need to investigate. Just to clarify, is the red stuff coming up with every cough, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Inter… intermittent. Yeah, that sounds right. Not every time. Sometimes just regular… phlegm. Other times… red. It’s… hard to say how often. Happens more when I… try to cough hard, I think. Like I’m really gettin’ somethin’ up. Does that make sense? It’s been a bit, you know. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Reyno. Thank you for clarifying. And it's perfectly alright if details are a little fuzzy; we'll work through everything. Now, can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Uh… what do you mean? Like… how it feels? It's just a cough. A regular cough. Feels like… somethin’ stuck in my chest, kinda. Gets worse when I lay down, I think. And… sometimes it makes my chest hurt a little when I really hack at it. But mostly just… a cough. It's been goin' on… a while now. I don't remember exactly when it started. A few months, maybe? Longer? Hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of a cough that worsens when lying down, and some chest discomfort with forceful coughing. I understand. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. I get… tired. Real tired. But I always been tired. Hard work, you know? And… I ain’t been eatin’ much. Not feelin’ hungry. But… that's kinda normal too. Lost some weight, maybe? I don’t really… check. It’s all kinda blurry. No fever, I don’t think. Don’t usually get fevers. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Reyno. Fatigue and decreased appetite with some weight loss are good things to note. Now, regarding your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Not that I remember. The usual… colds, flu, stuff like that. But nothin’ serious. Had my gallbladder out… a long time ago. That’s… that’s about it. I get Medicare, if that means somethin’. And I think I saw a doctor… a few years back, for my blood pressure, maybe? But I don't really remember what they said. It's all a bit of a mess, honestly. I mostly just try to ignore it till it gets bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past cholecystectomy and possible history of hypertension. We can certainly look into those records through Medicare. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My brother… he had… somethin' with his lungs. Real bad. Had to go to the city for it. That was… years ago. He smoked too. But… that’s about all I know. My mother… she lived a long time, never really sick. And my father… he passed when I was young. Can’t really remember much about his health. It was a long time ago. Sorry. I ain’t much help with that part.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Reyno. Any information is helpful. Now, can you tell me a bit about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Smoking… Yeah. Started when I was young. Stupid, I know. Been smokin' ever since. A pack a day, maybe more. Used to be more, but I cut back a bit. Tried to quit a few times, but… didn't stick. Been doin’ it… a long time. Too long. That's probably why I'm here, right? That's what you're gettin’ at. Sorry. Shoulda quit.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Reyno, smoking is a significant factor we need to consider. Thank you for being honest with me. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never really had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes… but that could be anything. I don’t take much medicine, honestly. Just… over-the-counter stuff when I got a cold. Not really allergic to anything, I don't think. Sorry. I’m really not much help with all this, am I? I just want to know what’s wrong with my cough. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You are a great help, Mr. Reyno. We're just gathering information. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes I take something for my knees. They ache, you know? Old age. But it's just… ibuprofen, I think. The regular stuff. And… sometimes a cough syrup, when it gets bad. But that’s about it. Nothing else. Really. Just ibuprofen and cough syrup. That's all. I don't take a lot of pills. Don't like 'em. .
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and over-the-counter cough syrup. Thank you. Now, Mr. Reyno, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look in your throat. Is that alright with you?
