DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Chagaris, is it? Hmm. Well, honestly, I don’t much feel like telling you. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed to “get this looked at.” Honestly, doctors these days… always wanting to poke and prod. It’s just… a little thing. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. I assure you, we'll only proceed at a pace you're comfortable with. Your daughter seems to be looking out for your well-being, and sometimes a second opinion is helpful. Perhaps we can start with what your daughter is concerned about?
PATIENT: Concerned? She’s always concerned. Honestly, a bit of a worrywart, that girl. But… well, it’s my feet, I suppose. They’ve been… achy. For a while now. Not terribly painful, mind you. Just… uncomfortable. And they look a bit… funny. Though I’ve had worse, believe me. Back in Haiti, we didn’t have doctors for everything! You made do.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like you've certainly had a lifetime of experiences. “Achy” can mean different things to different people, so could you describe the ache a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. Describe? Doctor, I'm not a scientist. It aches. Like… well, like when your shoes are a little too tight, but they aren’t, really. More… deep down. In the bones, maybe? I don’t know. It's not a sharp pain. It's just… there. All the time. And sometimes worse when I stand for too long, but I don't do much standing these days, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. “Deep down” and constant… alright. May I take a quick look at your feet, Ms. Gunasekara?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Must you? I was hoping we could just… talk about it. But alright, go ahead. But be gentle, now. I have sensitive skin. And don’t pull anything!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to gently feel around. I notice some mild swelling on both feet, particularly around the ankles, and some slight redness. The skin appears generally healthy, but there are a couple of small calluses on the heels. I also observe a slight inward curve to both feet. I’m noting some mild swelling and redness, and a bit of an inward curve to your feet. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Oh, goodness, no. Just the achiness. Though… now that you mention it… sometimes, in the evenings, my feet feel a little… cold. Even with socks on! It’s probably just my circulation, though. I'm an old woman, after all. Things wear out.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Coldness in the evenings can be related to circulation, as you mentioned, or other factors. And it’s good you’re aware of changes. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, Lord. Where to begin? I've lived a life, Doctor. I’ve had… well, everything, probably. Let me see… I had my gallbladder taken out years ago. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes. But I take pills for that. My daughter keeps track of all that. She’s very organized. Oh! And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But it healed alright. Otherwise… I don’t remember much else. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Knowing about the gallbladder removal, blood pressure, and the fall is helpful. Let me just access your records here to see if I can get a more complete picture. Ah, yes. I see here you’ve been diagnosed with hypertension, and you were treated for a fractured wrist in 2018. It also looks like you’ve had annual check-ups with Dr. Dubois. Do you mind if I review those notes?
PATIENT: Oh, Dubois… a perfectly nice man. A little young, though. Always rushing around. Yes, of course, look at his notes. Honestly, I barely remember those appointments. I just tell my daughter what she needs to know and she handles everything. She's good at that sort of thing. It’s a blessing, really. Don’t spend too long on it, though. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've reviewed Dr. Dubois’ notes. It seems your blood pressure is generally well-controlled with your current medication. There's a mention of some mild arthritis, which can sometimes cause joint pain. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, it's possible the ache in your feet is related to the arthritis, or simply age-related wear and tear. However, the swelling and the coldness are something we should investigate further. To help rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some simple blood tests and an X-ray of your feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… X-rays… Oh, honestly, Doctor, all this fuss over a little ache! Are you sure it's necessary? It all sounds so… invasive. I don't like hospitals, you know. Never have. But alright. If you insist. But promise me it won't take long. And no needles bigger than a pin! My daughter will be furious if I come home with a sore arm.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s not my intention to cause any unnecessary discomfort. The blood tests and X-ray will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of action. The blood tests are just a small sample, and the X-ray is completely painless. We’ll take it as quickly and gently as possible. I'll order those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is very experienced. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Next week… alright. I suppose so. As long as I don't have to wait too long. I have a book club meeting, you know. Very important. And make sure they tell me not to wear any metal. I always forget. Honestly, Doctor, this is a lot of trouble for a few aching feet. But alright, get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. Here are the requisitions for the lab and the X-ray. The lab technician will be happy to assist you, and they will remind you about removing any metal jewelry or clothing. The X-ray technician will also guide you through the process. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. In the meantime, if you experience any increased pain, swelling, or develop a fever, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that's all. Honestly, Doctor, you've been very thorough. A bit too thorough, perhaps, but thorough nonetheless. Just… try not to keep me waiting next week, alright? My book club is discussing a very important novel. And I have a strong opinion on the protagonist. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll be going now. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. We’ll do our best to keep your wait time to a minimum. We look forward to seeing you next Tuesday. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your book club meeting! .
