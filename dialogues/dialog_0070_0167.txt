DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is… bothering me. It’s a sore, you see. A very painful sore. It won't get better. Been like this for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. A sore on your foot that’s been persistent. I understand. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to begin? It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started small, like a little cut, maybe from walking barefoot. But it got bigger and… well, deeper. Now it’s very red, and it hurts when I walk. Even just standing is not so good. I try to keep it clean, but… it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. That's helpful. So, it began as a small cut on the bottom of your foot, near the toes, and has progressively gotten larger and more painful, even with keeping it clean. When you say “a little while,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… slips away from an old man, you know? Let me think… maybe two, three months now? It’s hard to say exactly. It was small then, and I didn’t think much of it. I just hoped it would heal on its own. But it didn't. It just kept getting worse, slowly. And more painful. Especially lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, two to three months. And it's been gradually worsening, with increased pain recently. Have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore at all?
PATIENT: Drainage… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… yes. A little bit of… wetness. Not a lot, but enough to have to put a bandage on. It's not like a big leak, but it’s not… clear either, you know? It’s… yellowish, maybe? I don’t know the proper words, Doctor. But it’s not clean looking. That’s for sure. I change the bandage every day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. Yellowish drainage is certainly something we need to consider. And you’re right to be concerned about it not being clear. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or redness spreading from the sore on your foot?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot, and my wife… well, my late wife, she always checked my temperature when I felt sick. Now it’s just me. And I forget things. No chills, either. Redness… yes, a little bit. Around the sore, it’s red. And… sometimes my foot feels warm, even when it's not hot. But I don’t know if that’s just because of the sore. Is that bad? It’s hard to tell, you know? Old man problems.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It's perfectly alright to be unsure, and it's good you're sharing all of this with me. Redness around the sore and warmth are things we’ll definitely want to examine. Would you mind if I take a look at your foot now?
PATIENT: No, no, please do, Doctor. I’m happy to have you look. I’ve been trying to take care of it myself, but I think it's time for a professional. It just… hurts too much. And I don't want it to get any worse.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. If you could please sit or lie down comfortably, I'll take a look. Okay, I see the sore here on the bottom of your foot, near your toes. It appears to be ulcerated, and there is some redness extending around the edges. The drainage is indeed yellowish and has a slightly foul odor. It’s quite tender to the touch, and I do feel some warmth in the area. Given what you’ve described and what I’m seeing, it appears you may have a developing infection. We need to determine the extent of the infection to decide on the best course of treatment. I'd like to order a culture of the drainage to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. I also recommend a blood test to check for any signs of systemic infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Infection… oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. A culture and a blood test… yes, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want it to get better, and to stop hurting. Is it… serious? I have… I had diabetes, you know. My wife always took care of it. I'm not so good at remembering all the things now. Is that related to this?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned your history of diabetes, Emiliano. That’s very important. Diabetes can indeed contribute to foot ulcers and infections, and it can also make them more difficult to heal. While I don’t want to alarm you, infections in the feet can be serious, particularly with diabetes. That’s why we’re taking this seriously and doing the tests. We need to identify the bacteria causing the infection and determine if it has spread. However, with prompt treatment, we can usually manage these infections effectively. I’m going to order the culture and blood tests right away. We’ll also need to check your blood sugar levels to see how well controlled your diabetes is. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep the wound clean and dry, and to avoid putting weight on your foot as much as possible. I’m going to prescribe a course of oral antibiotics to start immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes, that sounds good. Keep it clean and dry… I try, Doctor, I really do. But it's hard. And my memory… Sometimes I forget if I've already put medicine on it, or changed the bandage. I live alone now, you see. Oral antibiotics… yes, please. Whatever helps. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. It's a comfort to know what's going on. Do I need to do anything special before the blood test?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. I understand it can be challenging to manage things on your own, especially with memory concerns. We can work through this together. For the blood test, you don’t need to do anything special. It's a simple draw, and we can do it right here in the clinic. You don’t need to fast, or anything like that. I’m also going to give you a referral to a podiatrist. They specialize in foot care and can help with wound care and preventing future problems. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A podiatrist… yes, that sounds sensible too, Doctor. Someone who knows about feet… that’s a good idea. My wife… she handled everything. I miss her very much. But yes, a podiatrist, please. Anything to help my foot get better. And thank you again. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. It’s perfectly alright to miss your wife, and it sounds like she was a wonderful caregiver. We’ll get you set up with the podiatrist referral right away. Here are your orders for the lab work, your prescription for the antibiotics, and the information for the podiatrist. Please take these to the lab and the pharmacy after your appointment. The nurse will go over the antibiotic instructions with you before you leave. Now, I want to be very clear. If you notice any increased redness, swelling, pain, fever, or chills, please come to the emergency room immediately. We need to address any signs of a worsening infection right away. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Increased redness, swelling, pain, fever, chills… yes, I understand. Emergency room. I will remember that. I will. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so thoroughly. I… I don't have family nearby, Doctor. If… if something happens, and I forget… is there someone I can call? I don’t want to be alone if I get sick.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Emiliano. And it’s wise to think about that. We do have a social worker here at the clinic who can help you with resources and support, including identifying a contact person or emergency contact. They can also assist with transportation or other needs if you're concerned about getting to appointments or managing things at home. Would you like me to connect you with the social worker before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh… that would be… wonderful, Doctor. Yes, please. That would be a great help. I… I didn’t know the clinic had someone like that. I’ve always tried to manage on my own, but… it’s getting harder. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been very kind to an old man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. It’s our job to help, and you’re not alone in this. I’ve contacted the social worker, and they’ll be in to speak with you shortly. They can discuss your concerns and help you develop a plan. Is there anything else I can assist you with before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve been very patient with an old man’s worries. I appreciate everything you’ve done. And thank you for contacting the social worker. I… I feel a little better now, knowing I’m not completely alone.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Emiliano. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. If anything changes or if you have any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. It was a pleasure meeting you today, and I wish you a speedy recovery. .
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. And thank you again, for everything. You've been a true blessing. .
