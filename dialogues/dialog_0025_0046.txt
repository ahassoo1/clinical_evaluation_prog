DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been having some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s definitely uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Pressure,” you say. Okay. And how long has this “pressure” been going on for?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, around the end of June. So, maybe a little over a month now. It comes and goes, but it seems to be happening more frequently lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, over a month. More frequent lately... Is it constant when it is happening, or does it fluctuate even within a single episode?
PATIENT: It definitely fluctuates. It’s not a constant, solid pressure. It’ll be stronger at times, and then lessen, almost like… waves, I suppose. And sometimes it feels more like a fullness, rather than actual pressure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. "Waves" and "fullness." Alright. And is this pressure associated with any difficulty actually urinating?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, it is. Sometimes it's hard to start, and then the stream isn't as strong as it usually is. It doesn’t happen every time, but when the pressure is really bothering me, it’s much more noticeable. It feels like I don’t quite empty my bladder completely, either.
DOCTOR: Difficulty starting, weak stream, and incomplete emptying… Okay. And are you experiencing any pain while urinating, or pain in your lower abdomen, back, or sides?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, thankfully. That’s why I said it wasn’t painful earlier. It’s purely the pressure and the trouble with urinating. Sometimes, after I do go, I feel a little… achy in my lower abdomen, but it goes away pretty quickly. It’s not a sharp pain, just a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain during, just a post-void dull ache. Hmm. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything unusual?
PATIENT: Yes, I have, actually. It’s been a little…cloudy, I think. And I’m not sure if it’s just me, but it seems to smell a little stronger than usual. I haven’t noticed any blood or anything like that, thankfully. It’s just not as clear as it normally is. I drink a lot of water, so I usually have pretty clear urine.
DOCTOR: Cloudy urine and a stronger odor… Okay. Now, Ms. Creagh, I’m going to ask a few more general questions. Have you had any fevers, chills, or nausea recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any of those things. No fever, no chills, and definitely no nausea. I've been feeling otherwise healthy, just this bladder issue. I have been a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to the stress at work, honestly.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly do that. Now, have you had any urinary tract infections, or UTIs, in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I think I had one when I was in college, and another one a few years ago. I remember it being quite uncomfortable, and I had to take antibiotics. It’s been a long time since then, though. I was hoping this wasn't another one, but the symptoms are similar.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of UTIs. Right. And what about your medical history in general?
PATIENT: Well, I have mild hypertension, but it's well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, I'm generally healthy. I had a fairly standard childhood – all vaccinations, no major illnesses. My mother has type 2 diabetes, and my father had high cholesterol, if that’s relevant. I try to eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly, but work gets in the way sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, controlled. Family history noted. Alright, Ms. Creagh, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, including a urine sample. That will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand. A urine sample and a physical exam are definitely fine. Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll excuse me for just a moment, I’ll prepare the testing supplies. I’ll be right back with a collection cup for the urine sample. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I think I’ve told you everything I can think of at the moment. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here's the cup. Please collect a midstream urine sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample mid-flow, and finish urinating afterwards. I’ll give you a few minutes privacy. There’s a lid for the cup, and a place to leave it when you’re finished. I’ll be right outside when you’re done.
PATIENT: Okay, a midstream sample. I remember from the last time I had a UTI. Thank you, Doctor. I'll be right out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh, do you have the sample?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I left it on the counter, with the lid secured. Is that alright? It was a bit difficult to get, but I think I got a good sample.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then do a quick pelvic exam. I need to check for tenderness or any other abnormalities. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. Pelvic exam is fine. Just let me know if anything feels…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing normally. No apparent tenderness to palpation. …Alright. No significant masses or tenderness noted externally. Internal exam... …There’s a bit of discomfort with the speculum insertion, but no acute pain otherwise. Cervix appears normal, no discharge. Uterus feels normal in size and position. Adnexa… …slight tenderness on the left side, but nothing alarming. Alright, Ms. Creagh. Everything appears relatively normal on initial examination, though the left adnexal tenderness is something we'll need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. That’s…reassuring, I suppose, even with the tenderness. What does that tenderness mean, exactly? And what kind of investigation are you thinking of? Is it something serious? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just get anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: Anxiety is understandable. The tenderness isn't necessarily serious, but it warrants investigation. It could be a number of things – a minor inflammation, a small cyst, or even referred pain from another source. To get a clearer picture, I'm going to order a complete urinalysis, a urine culture, and a pelvic ultrasound. The ultrasound will allow us to visualize your uterus and ovaries, and determine if there are any abnormalities. I'm also going to check your blood pressure again, just to ensure it's well-controlled. While we wait for the test results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. If you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies to medications. That all sounds…thorough, which is good. A urinalysis, culture, and ultrasound. I can do that. Drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding caffeine is no problem. And I’ll be sure to go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. How long will it take to get the test results, approximately? And where will I go for the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: The urinalysis and culture typically take 24 to 48 hours. The ultrasound, I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center across town - it's on Elm Street. They can usually schedule you within a few days. Once they have the results, they'll send them directly to me. I’ll also prescribe you a short course of phenazopyridine to help relieve the burning sensation you might experience while urinating - though you don't seem to be having that right now, it's best to be prepared. Take it as directed, and be aware it will turn your urine orange. Here’s the prescription and the referral. Let me know if you have any trouble scheduling the ultrasound. As I said, if you develop a fever or severe pain, don't hesitate to go to the ER. Otherwise, we'll review the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, a short course of phenazopyridine and the referral to the imaging center. I understand. The orange urine… I’ll be prepared for that. No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I'll schedule the ultrasound tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you don’t hear from my office within a week, please call to follow up. Have a good day, Ms. Creagh. .
