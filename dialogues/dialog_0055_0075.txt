DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even though I use a machine at night for my sleep apnea. It’s just… lingering sleepiness, you know? It’s making things a bit difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. Lingering sleepiness despite CPAP use… Yes. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been probably… three or four months now, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, not all at once. At first, I thought it was just a particularly warm spell making me tired, but it hasn’t really gone away. I use the machine every night, though. I'm very careful about that.
DOCTOR: Very good. Consistency is important. And can you describe the sleepiness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, Doctor. It’s more… a heavy feeling. Like I didn’t quite get enough rest, even after a full eight hours. I have trouble staying focused in the afternoon, especially. And sometimes I just feel… sluggish. It makes reading – which I enjoy, you know, I used to teach – a bit of a chore. It’s frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent feeling of not being fully rested despite adequate sleep duration... And you mentioned difficulty with focus. Have you noticed any changes in your memory lately, or any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Memory… not really, no. I’m fairly sharp for my age, if I may say so myself. I still remember details from my teaching days like they were yesterday! But now that you mention it, maybe I am a little more irritable than usual. My daughter keeps telling me I'm being grumpy, but I just thought it was the heat. It’s hard to say. Perhaps a little bit of both?
DOCTOR: Irritability can certainly be a symptom. Now, let's move on to some other areas. Do you experience any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No headaches, no. And no dizziness either. My vision… well, it’s not what it used to be, naturally. I wear glasses, as you can see. But no changes in my vision that I’ve noticed. It’s just the normal age-related stuff, I think. Everything looks blurry if I take them off, but that’s been the case for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any snoring, beyond what you might expect with sleep apnea?
PATIENT: That’s a funny question, Doctor. Snoring… well, my wife used to complain about it, years ago. She said it sounded like a freight train. But she passed away a few years back, so I haven't had anyone to comment on it recently. I assume it's still there, though. It’s hard to imagine it just… disappeared. The machine helps with it, I believe. It certainly made a difference when I first started using it.
DOCTOR: I see. My condolences for your loss, Mr. Paske. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s been a while, but one gets used to it, eventually. As for medical conditions… let me think. I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for. And my cholesterol is a little high, too. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that hasn't bothered me since. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for an old man, if I do say so myself. I walk every day, you know. Keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Good. Staying active is excellent. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure and cholesterol, if you recall the names?
PATIENT: Let me see… for my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril. And for the cholesterol, it’s Atorvastatin, I believe. Yes, that’s right. I take them both every morning with my breakfast. I haven’t changed the dosage on either one in quite some time, everything’s been pretty stable. My doctor checks them regularly, you see. I’m good about following instructions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The EHR confirms those medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life, and never had a reaction. My wife always joked that I had an iron stomach. I've never been one to worry about food sensitivities or anything like that. A little bit of everything never hurt anyone, in moderation, of course.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. I'm not afraid of a little examination. Go right ahead. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable, alright? Old bones aren’t as forgiving as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Deep breath again… good. Lungs sound clear. Your pulse is regular, but slightly slow. Now, just relax your arm… and let it fall. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. I’m also going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal to the touch. Everything seems within normal limits, but the persistent sleepiness despite CPAP and medication warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: That’s good to know, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to check everything so thoroughly. So, what does that mean? What kind of investigation are we talking about? Is it something serious? I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it’s always best to be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're proactive, Mr. Paske. While it's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, persistent fatigue can have several causes. To rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood work. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and iron studies. We should also consider a sleep study to reassess your CPAP settings, as there might be a leak or other issue impacting its effectiveness. It's possible it could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, but we need to rule out other conditions, such as anemia or an underactive thyroid. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Absolutely. I trust your judgment. Blood work and another sleep study… fine, let’s do it. It’s better to be safe than sorry, as they say. When can I schedule the blood work? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work now. You can go to the lab at the clinic, or any lab that accepts our insurance. The results usually take 2-3 business days. I’ll also have the sleep study scheduled for you next week. The scheduler will call you to confirm the appointment. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your medications as prescribed, and try to maintain your regular activity level. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or you develop any new symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we’re looking into this. Two or three business days for the results… alright. I’ll keep an eye on things and let you know if anything changes. Thank you again. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. We will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss the next steps. Have a good day.
