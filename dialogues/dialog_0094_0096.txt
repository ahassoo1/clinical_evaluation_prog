DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, actually. I’ve been getting really bothered by the sun lately. Not like sunburn bothered, more like… everything’s just too bright, and it hurts my eyes. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s getting worse, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is good to know – and it’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out. “Too bright” and hurting your eyes… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's not a pain, exactly. More like… a really strong discomfort. Everything seems washed out, and even on cloudy days, it feels like I need to squint all the time. Inside, with the lights on, it's manageable, but outside… even with sunglasses, it's tough. It makes me want to just stay indoors, which isn't much fun. And it's not just my eyes, either. Sometimes my head feels a little achy after being in the sun, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Arbin. It sounds quite bothersome. Okay, so it’s not a sharp pain, but a discomfort and sensitivity to light, even with sunglasses. And you've noticed some headaches after sun exposure. To get a better picture of what's going on, let’s go through a few things. First, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything looks the same, as far as I can tell. I haven't noticed anything blurry or double vision or anything like that. I had my eyes checked a couple of years ago, just a regular check-up, and they said everything was fine then. I haven’t had any problems seeing, just… the brightness is the issue. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the normal vision check a couple of years ago. And you're right, it is hard to explain sometimes when it's not a typical vision problem. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity and headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, actually. Just generally run down. And… this is probably nothing, but my skin feels a little sensitive, too. Not a rash or anything, just… easily irritated. Like, I used a new soap last week and it really bothered me, which usually doesn't happen. I thought it was just the soap, but… maybe it’s related?
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and some skin sensitivity as well. That’s helpful information. And it’s good you’re telling me about seemingly small things – they can often be important. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That's fine, go ahead. Honestly, not much to tell. I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does, and I broke my arm when I was a kid, but nothing serious. I lost my wife a few years back, but that wasn't an illness, just… heartbreaking. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I’ve got Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for letting me know about your Medicare. And I am very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so no significant past medical history besides the flu and a broken arm. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Just the usual check-ups and things. I try to stay on top of my health, you know? It's important. I haven't been in the hospital for anything other than when my wife… well, never mind. But no surgeries, definitely.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, that’s good. And thank you for sharing that with me. It’s understandable that would be a difficult memory. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any eye problems, like glaucoma or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had pretty bad eyesight when she got older, she needed really strong glasses. I think she had cataracts, but I’m not completely sure. My father… I don't really remember him having any eye problems. He passed away when I was young. And I don't know much about my wife’s family, honestly. We didn't talk about medical history much. So, probably my mother, but I can't be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially cataracts in your mother. That’s helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol either. Never really been interested. I prefer a good cup of tea, if that counts! I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. I used to be a gardener, but… well, I haven’t done much of that lately. But I try.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Arbin. Avoiding smoking and alcohol is very good for your overall health. And a good cup of tea is always a plus! Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I can take most things without any problems. I’ve had a few headaches over the years, but nothing that an over-the-counter pain reliever couldn’t fix. And no food allergies, as far as I’m aware. I've eaten pretty much everything. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all very helpful, Arbin. Thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then take a look at your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Just to see if I can see anything obvious going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m just hoping to figure out what’s causing this, you know? It’s getting harder and harder to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Alright, let’s start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. Okay… I’m seeing some mild swelling of the optic nerve bilaterally, and the retinas look a little pale. It’s subtle, but it’s there. I also notice your pupils are reacting a bit slowly to light. Do you feel any pain when I shine the light in your eyes?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the same discomfort, like everything’s too bright. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It’s hard to explain. It’s more like… a strain, I guess? Like I’m squinting even when I’m not trying to. The light just feels… intense. Is that normal? What does swelling of the… what did you call it… optic nerve mean?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to explain, and you’re right to ask about the swelling of the optic nerve. It’s not necessarily an immediate cause for panic, but it can indicate a few different things. It could be related to inflammation, increased pressure in the skull, or even certain infections. The slow pupil reaction is also something we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms – the light sensitivity, headaches, fatigue, skin sensitivity, and now the findings on the exam – I think it’s important to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a blood test to check for inflammation and any underlying infections. I also want to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any increased pressure or other structural problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then let’s do it. I just want to know what’s going on and hopefully get it fixed. An MRI… is that painful? And how long will the blood test take? I have a bit of a drive to get home.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the MRI. It’s not painful at all. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a little loud, so we’ll give you earplugs. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The blood test will be much quicker. We can draw a small sample here in the office, and it usually takes only a few minutes. The results will take a couple of days to come back. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you avoid any bright sunlight as much as possible. Wear sunglasses even on cloudy days, and if you’re going to be outside for an extended period, consider wearing a hat. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll schedule the MRI for you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Avoiding the sun… I can definitely do that. It’s been a struggle already. And scheduling the MRI… alright. Whatever’s easiest. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. It’s been… unsettling, to say the least. Let’s get the blood test done, then.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arbin. I'm glad I can help. It's always best to get to the bottom of things, and you’re right to be proactive about your health. Let me call the nurse now to get the blood test done. She’ll explain the process to you. Once that’s done, we’ll schedule the MRI. Do you have any questions for me before I call her?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay for now. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we're doing something about it. Go ahead and call the nurse. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. She should be in shortly. Just relax, and she’ll take good care of you. I'll also have my assistant schedule the MRI appointment for you before you leave. It’s likely we’ll need to do it at a local imaging center, as we don’t have one here in the office. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden vision changes, severe headaches, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Doctor. Sudden vision changes, severe headaches… I’ll remember that. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I really appreciate it. I'm ready for the nurse whenever she's ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. She'll be right with you. I’ll check back in with you after the blood test to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, feel free to ask any questions that come to mind. And remember, we're here to help.
PATIENT: .
