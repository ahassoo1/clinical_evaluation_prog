DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Reisig, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… it’s… going to the bathroom. Yes, that’s it. It’s hard now. Takes me a while, you know? It's been… a little while, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing difficulty with urination – it takes you a longer time to empty your bladder. And it has been going on for a little while now. Could you tell me a little more about how it's difficult?
PATIENT: Hmm… how is it difficult? Well, it just… doesn't go easy. Like, I have to… push, maybe? And it’s… weak, the stream. Not like it used to be, that’s for sure. Sometimes it stops and starts, you know? And then… I feel like there’s still some left in there, even after I’m done. Does that make sense? It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. You’re describing difficulty initiating your stream, a weak stream, intermittency—stopping and starting—and a sensation of incomplete emptying. That is frustrating. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… well, I get up at night sometimes to go. More than I used to, I think. My husband says so. And… sometimes I feel a little… shaky after. Not all the time, but sometimes. And… oh! I get thirsty a lot. Is that a symptom? I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing nocturia – waking up at night to urinate – and that's increased recently. You’ve also noticed some shakiness after urinating and increased thirst. These are all helpful things to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a tricky one. I’ve been to a lot of doctors over the years, you know. Let me see… I think… they said something about my blood pressure once? A long time ago. And my joints ache something awful, but that’s just old age, I reckon. And… I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but I got over that. I can’t really remember anything else, to be honest. It all gets a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll take things one step at a time. So, you mentioned a history of high blood pressure and some joint pain. Do you currently take any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… No, not really. Not that I remember. My daughter used to bring me pills, but… she moved away, you know? And I just sort of… stopped taking them, I guess. I don’t like taking too many pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to feel that way about medications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago! And… oh! I broke my wrist once, when I was gardening. That was a mess. I was in the hospital for a few days. But… that was ages ago. Nothing else that I can really remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in childhood and a broken wrist that required hospitalization. Thank you. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, that's a hard one. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She got tired easily. And my brother… he had something with his sugar, I believe. Diabetes, maybe? But… everyone’s gone now, you know. It's been a long time. I don’t really remember the details.
DOCTOR: I understand. A family history of heart problems and potentially diabetes. That's helpful to know. Finally, before we move on to an exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, dear. I eat most anything. And I haven't really reacted to any pills, not that I recall. I get a bit of a rash sometimes when the sun is really strong, but that’s just the heat, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen, that was all very helpful. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a gentle abdominal exam. We’ll also need to check a urine sample. This will help us get a better understanding of what might be going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I've had a lot of exams over the years, you know. Just try to be gentle, my old skin is rather thin. And don’t mind if I ask a few questions, my mind wanders sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please feel free to ask any questions you have at any time. Let's start by checking your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There you are, dear. It's been a bit chilly lately, haven't it? Makes my joints ache something awful.
DOCTOR: It has been rather cool, Ms. Stoffregen. And yes, that can certainly exacerbate joint pain. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 82. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear, though a little quiet. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. This won't hurt, but please let me know if you feel any tenderness. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don't feel any significant pain, but I can feel your bladder is a little full. Now, if you could provide a urine sample, that would be very helpful. I'll give you a cup and instructions.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. A full bladder, you say? That doesn't surprise me, not with all the trouble I’ve been having. I hope it won’t take me too long, my old muscles aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Stoffregen. There's no rush at all. There’s a restroom just down the hall. When you’re finished, just bring the cup back, and I'll send it to the lab. I’ll be right here when you return. And please, don't hesitate to call out if you need any assistance.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That’s very kind of you. I'll be as quick as I can. Here you are, dear. All done. I hope that was enough.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. That looks perfect. Now, we'll just wait for the lab results, which should be available within a day or two. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, your symptoms—difficulty urinating, weak stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying, nocturia, and increased thirst—could be caused by a few different things. It could be a urinary tract infection, an enlarged prostate – though less common in women – or simply a weakened bladder muscle due to age. It's also important to rule out other potential causes, such as medication side effects or even dehydration. To get a more definitive answer, I'd like to order a urinalysis – to check for infection – and a post-void residual volume – to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. If the results indicate something more serious, we may need to consider further testing, such as an ultrasound or a referral to a urologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that sounds like a lot of tests. Tests… I’ve had my fair share of those over the years. But… if you think it’s best, dear, then I trust your judgement. I just… don’t want to go through too much fuss. A weakened bladder, you say? That’s what I figured. Old age… it takes its toll on everything. Yes, alright. Do what you think is best. But try to keep it simple, if you can. And let me know if it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll absolutely keep it as simple as possible. The urinalysis is just a quick urine sample – which you’ve already provided – and the post-void residual volume is a non-invasive ultrasound of your bladder after you urinate. It doesn’t hurt at all. I’m ordering both tests now. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – unless your doctor has advised otherwise – and trying to urinate every two to three hours, even if you don’t feel a strong urge. I'll also give you a handout with information on bladder health and some simple exercises you can do to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles – also known as Kegel exercises. These can often help with urinary incontinence and improve bladder control. I'll call you with the results as soon as they are available, likely within two business days. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as fever, chills, blood in your urine, or severe pain—please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. That all sounds manageable. Fluid intake… yes, I suppose I can manage that. And the exercises… Kegel exercises, you say? I’ve heard of those. Never tried them myself, but… I suppose it's worth a shot. Hmm… let me see. I don't think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… try not to scare me with the results, dear. Old age is scary enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. I promise to be as honest and straightforward as possible, but I also promise not to unnecessarily alarm you. We'll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything in detail. Here’s that handout, with more information on bladder health and those exercises. It also includes a number you can call if you have any questions. Well, that concludes our consultation for today. Thank you for coming in. I’ll be in touch as soon as those results are available. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, Ms. Stoffregen. And remember, take things easy.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. Yes, alright. I will. Take things easy, you say? That’s good advice. I certainly will. You have a good day too, dear. And thank you again for everything.
