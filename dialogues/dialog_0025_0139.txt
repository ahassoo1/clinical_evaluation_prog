DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Fitness check. For… referee. I need paper say I okay. For work. Want finish quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: A “paper,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… doctor note. For league. They want make sure I… strong enough. Not old. I am thirty-one. Is okay, right? I still… move good. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a comprehensive evaluation is still necessary, regardless of your age. We need to assess your overall health to ensure you’re fit for… rigorous activity. It's not just about feeling okay, it's about being okay. Now, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Hospital… yes. Wife… she… sick. Last year. I… took care of her. A lot of doctor visits. But I not sick. Just… sad. No big problems with my body. Maybe small cold sometimes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you haven’t had any serious health issues yourself. But it’s still important to document everything, even “small colds.” They can sometimes indicate underlying issues. So, last year, you were primarily focused on caring for your wife. And before that?
PATIENT: Before… work. Always work. Refractory… the brick stuff. Hot. Hard. No time for… getting sick. Before that, school. Normal school. Nothing special. I think I… broke arm when little boy. But… healed good. Is that all? I not remember much.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major past surgical history, it seems. Family history?
PATIENT: Family… my mother… she… old now. Always tired. But… China. Doctor not… good there. Not like here. Father… he worked farm. Strong man. Died… many years ago. Work accident. I think. Nobody said much. Is that… helpful? I don’t know what you want.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a general idea, Mr. Shanor. Any heart problems, diabetes, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Heart… maybe? Grandfather… he… fell down. Doctor say something about heart. I not understand. Cancer… I think aunt had that. But… far away. We not see her much. Diabetes… no. I don’t think so. We eat rice. Is healthy. Right? I am… getting confused now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s focus on you again. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. No. I don’t think so. I eat… everything. Sometimes… itchy eyes in spring. But that… pollen. Not food. Not medicine. Is that bad? I… just rub eyes. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… just drink tea when cold. Sometimes… painkiller for back. Work. Very hard. But not… every day. Just when… really bad. Is that important to write down? I just buy it at… store. Not doctor.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Shanor. What kind of painkiller, and how often are you taking it?
PATIENT: Uh… Ibuprofen? The… blue pills. When back hurt… maybe two times a month? Sometimes… not every month. Depends. Heavy lifting. Hot work. Is… okay? I work very hard. I need to be strong for the league. They need good referees. I don't want to… slow down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we'll assess your musculoskeletal system – your back, limbs, and joints. Can you step onto the scale, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Scale. Yes. Is… heavy? I eat good rice. And… noodles. For energy. Is good. Do quick, please? I have… league meeting later. Important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6. Within normal limits. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and hold it. Again... and exhale. Now, can you lie down on the exam table, please?
PATIENT: Is… something wrong? My wife… she always worried. I try not to worry. But… is okay? The heart? You hear something bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I’m hearing a slight wheeze in your lungs. And you mentioned taking ibuprofen regularly for back pain. This, combined with the wheezing, is concerning. Do you have any history of asthma or allergies that you haven't told me about?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. Never. Allergies… just itchy eyes. Like I said. Back pain… always back pain. Work. Very heavy. I lift… a lot. Is that bad? Maybe I… need better shoes? Or… more tea? My wife… she made good tea. Helped everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, with respect, I don’t think this is simply a matter of shoes or tea. The wheezing and regular ibuprofen use suggest a possible underlying respiratory issue, and chronic pain requiring frequent medication warrants further investigation. I recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity. We also need to discuss managing your back pain in a healthier way than relying on ibuprofen. I'm referring you to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a pulmonologist, and I'll also give you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever to tide you over while you schedule your appointments. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray? Test? Is… serious? Is something wrong? I just want paper for league. Say I okay. Can I… still referee? They need good referees. And… the pain. The back. If I can't work… I… don't know. What do you… mean? Explain slower. And… the paper. For the league. Is that still… possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, let's be clear. I cannot in good conscience give you a “paper” saying you are fit for duty without knowing what's going on with your lungs and back. That would be irresponsible. The X-ray will allow us to see if there's any damage to your lungs, and the pulmonary function test will measure how well you're breathing. As for your back pain, relying on ibuprofen long-term is not a solution and can be harmful. We need to identify the cause of the pain, not just mask the symptoms. I understand you need this “paper” for your league, but your health is far more important. I am referring you to Dr. Reed for a thorough evaluation. Until we have those results, I cannot clear you for strenuous activity. This isn't about denying you a job; it's about ensuring your safety and well-being. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: ...Okay. Yes. I… understand. But… the league. They will be angry. And… the money. I need money. How long… the tests? Can I… still work a little? Very careful? Just… small lifting? Please? If the tests… take long… I… don't know what I will do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, the tests should be scheduled within the week, and results typically take 24-48 hours to return. I strongly advise against any strenuous activity until we have those results. Even “small lifting” could exacerbate an underlying condition and cause further damage. Look, I understand your financial concerns, and I can provide a note explaining that you are undergoing medical evaluation and are temporarily unable to work. I can also connect you with resources that may be able to provide temporary financial assistance. But I will not clear you for activity without a proper diagnosis. That would be a violation of my ethical responsibility as a physician. Here’s what I'm going to do. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Reed, a prescription for a stronger pain reliever to manage your discomfort while you wait for the tests, and a note explaining your situation to your league. I'll also give you a list of local resources for financial assistance. Do you agree to this plan?
PATIENT: ...Yes. Okay. Plan. Yes. Thank you… I think. For the paper… and the… help. Just… quick, please? The paper. For the league. I need to… tell them. This is… bad. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The referral to Dr. Reed, the prescription for pain relief, and a note explaining that you are undergoing medical evaluation. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed as soon as possible. I understand this isn't what you wanted to hear, but I'm here to ensure your health and safety. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I'm going to step out now to allow you some time to process this information. Please, take care of yourself, Mr. Shanor. And remember, your health is the most important thing.
