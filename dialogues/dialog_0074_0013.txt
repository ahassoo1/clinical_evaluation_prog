DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been havin’ trouble… goin’ to the bathroom, mostly. It's like… it just won’t go, if you understand. It’s been happenin’ for a little while now, and it’s gettin’ kinda worrisome.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty with bowel movements can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, it’s not… not that kind of trouble. It's… when I pee. It’s hard to start, and when I do go, it takes a long time. And I don’t feel like I get it all out, you know? Like there’s still some left in there. It’s… uncomfortable. Sorry if that’s not very clear. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly clear, Mr. Hilber. Thank you for explaining. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty initiating your urine stream, a slow stream, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. That's helpful to know. Let's try to get a better understanding of how long this has been going on and if anything seems to make it better or worse. Could you tell me approximately when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago, I reckon. It wasn't too bad at first, just a little slow. But it’s been gettin’ worse each month, I think. I can’t quite put my finger on what makes it better or worse, Doctor. Seems kinda random, to be honest. Cold weather maybe? Or when I’m tired? I’m not sure, really. It just… happens. I drink a good amount of water, try to, at least. I don't want to get dehydrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressing over about three to four months, and doesn’t seem to have any obvious triggers. You're good about staying hydrated, that’s excellent. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, sometimes I feel like I gotta go all the time, even if I just went. And I get a little… achy down low, if you know what I mean. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And sometimes, when I finally get it all out, it feels like it stings a little bit. Not every time, but sometimes. I haven't had a fever, if that matters. I don't think so, anyway. It’s hard to remember these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent urination, a dull ache in your lower abdomen, and occasional stinging after urination. That's all very helpful information, Mr. Hilber. You mentioned the aching and stinging; is that present throughout the day, or more specifically when you are trying to urinate?
PATIENT: Mostly when I'm tryin' to go, Doctor. The ache builds up a little before, and then the stingin’ is right at the end, when I’m finishin’ up. It doesn’t last long, though. Just a moment or two. The rest of the time, I mostly just feel… uncomfortable, like there’s somethin’ there I can’t get rid of. Does that make sense? It’s a weird feelin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. It sounds quite bothersome. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, prostate problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but they fixed it with a stent, I think it was. That was… oh, twenty years ago, maybe more. Other than that… nothin’ too serious. The doctor always said I had high blood pressure, but it wasn’t bad enough for medicine. And my wife… she passed away a few years back. That was hard on me. Does that count? I don’t think I have anythin’ else… My wife always took care of the doctor stuff, so I wasn't always paying attention. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult. And it’s perfectly alright that you aren't sure about specific details of your medical history. It's helpful to know about the heart stent and the history of high blood pressure, though. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides the heart stent?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. They set it with a cast, but I don’t think that counts as a surgery. And… no, I don’t think so. Just the arm, and the heart. My wife had a few surgeries, but not me. I've mostly been lucky, I guess. Aside from this… trouble, that is. And my heart. It's hard to keep track of everything, getting older. I try, but… it slips my mind sometimes. .
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Hilber, it's perfectly normal. Knowing about the broken arm is good to have, but not essential. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have to medications, foods, or anything else?
