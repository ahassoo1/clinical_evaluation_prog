DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. The… the paper said something about… learning? I don't really need to learn anything. I know my job. Sheet metal. Very important work. But my husband, he said I should come. Something about… being safe? It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband is encouraging you to come in for a check-up, perhaps to make sure everything is healthy, and that’s a very thoughtful thing. We want to ensure you’re able to continue doing the important work you do with sheet metal, and that means being proactive about your health. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns right now that prompted this visit, or is this more of a general check-up as suggested by your husband?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I work with metal all day. My hands are always sore. And my back, sometimes. From bending. But that's just... work. Everyone gets sore. I don’t think that’s a symptom. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask for clarification. When I ask about symptoms, I mean anything new or different that you've been experiencing. You're absolutely correct – soreness from working with metal all day is very common, and not necessarily a cause for concern. However, it’s important for me to understand if anything has changed with that soreness – has it become more severe recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… it’s always there. But maybe… maybe it’s worse after I finish a big job. Like last week. We did that whole roof. Very complicated. My hands were… throbbing. And my back felt like it would break. But I used a cream. My neighbor gave it to me. Helped a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, the soreness is generally present, but seems to be significantly worse after particularly demanding jobs, like the roof you mentioned last week. And the cream provides some relief, but doesn't completely resolve it. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain in your hands?
PATIENT: Pain… it’s… achy. And sometimes… pins and needles. Especially when I’m trying to sleep. I have to shake my hands out. It wakes my husband up sometimes. He complains. But what can I do? It’s hands. I need my hands.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern; your hands are essential for your work, and this sounds quite bothersome. The aching and pins and needles, especially at night, are important details. Do you experience any weakness in your hands?
PATIENT: Weakness? Hmm… not really. I can still hold the metal. I can still use the tools. But it takes… more effort. Sometimes I drop things. And I have to grip really hard to keep a good hold. It’s just… tiring. And it gets worse the longer I work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, you’re able to continue your work, but it requires more effort, and you've noticed some difficulty with gripping and occasional dropping of tools. Now, let’s talk about your back. You mentioned it sometimes feels like it would break. Can you describe the pain in your back?
PATIENT: It's… a dull ache, mostly. But after a long job, it's sharp. Like someone is stabbing me. It’s lower back, mostly. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Not all the way, just… a little bit. Makes it hard to get up in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that becomes sharp after work, located in your lower back, and occasionally radiating down your leg. That’s important information. Does anything specifically make the back pain worse?
PATIENT: Lifting heavy metal, of course. Bending over for a long time. And… when it’s cold. Damp weather makes it awful. I try to wear warm clothes, but… it still hurts. My husband says I should stop lifting so much, but… that's my job! What else am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's challenging when your work is also the source of the pain. It's good that you’re aware of what aggravates the pain – lifting and bending in cold, damp weather. To get a complete picture, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, or any other health problems?
PATIENT: Arthritis? No. Diabetes? No. I don’t think so. I… went to the doctor once, a long time ago. For a cold. And another time for my ankle. I twisted it. But nothing serious. I don’t really like going to doctors. Too much poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. I appreciate you telling me that. We'll try to keep things as comfortable as possible. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I'm too healthy for surgeries. Well… mostly healthy. Just… sore. My husband keeps telling me I need to take better care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just that cream my neighbor gave me. And sometimes I take something for headaches. Ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. When the pain is really bad. But I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and the cream your neighbor gave you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband is the one with allergies. He can't eat shellfish. But I'm fine. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Finally, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm… my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he worked with metal too, actually. He had bad hands when he got older. Really swollen and stiff. But that was just… old age. He didn’t take care of himself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your mother, and your father also worked with metal and experienced hand problems later in life. Now, Ms. Fontanazza, I think I have a good understanding of what’s been going on. Given your description of the pain in your hands and back, the way it’s aggravated by work, and your family history, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of osteoarthritis, possibly exacerbated by repetitive strain from your work. The pins and needles in your hands could also suggest some nerve involvement, potentially carpal tunnel syndrome. However, to confirm this, we'll need to do a physical exam and likely some imaging. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Osteo… what? Carpal… something? Sounds complicated. Imaging? Like… x-rays? I don't like x-rays. Are they safe? And what does this mean? Am I going to… lose my hands?
DOCTOR: It does sound complicated, and it’s understandable to be worried. Osteoarthritis is a type of joint pain that happens when the cartilage in your joints breaks down over time. It's very common, especially with repetitive use, like in your line of work. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that affects the nerves in your wrist, which can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in your hands. X-rays are a safe way to look at the bones in your hands and back to see if there’s any evidence of arthritis or other problems. The amount of radiation is very small, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. And to answer your biggest concern: losing your hands is highly unlikely. The goal of getting a diagnosis is to help manage your pain and prevent things from getting worse, so you can continue doing the work you enjoy. Would you be comfortable with me performing a physical exam first, to get a better sense of what’s going on?
PATIENT: A physical exam… what does that involve? Will you… poke and prod? And if it is arthritis… is there anything I can do about it? My husband keeps saying I need to find a less physical job… but what else am I supposed to do? I’ve been working with metal my whole life.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension. A physical exam involves me checking your range of motion, checking for tenderness in your joints, and doing some simple neurological tests to assess the nerves in your hands and arms. There will be some gentle touching and movement – I promise to be as gentle as possible and explain everything before I do it. And you’re right to ask about treatment. If it is arthritis, there are many things we can do to manage the pain and improve your function. These include things like physical therapy, pain medication, lifestyle modifications, and assistive devices. We can also discuss strategies to protect your hands and prevent further damage. It’s important to remember we're working with you, to find the best plan for your needs. Would you like me to explain what the physical exam would entail in more detail?
PATIENT: …Explain it. Please. The more I know… the better. But… promise you won’t poke too hard. And what about… the imaging? Do I have to do that right away?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I promise I won't poke too hard. First, I'll ask you to move your fingers and wrists in different directions – bending, straightening, twisting. I'm looking to see your range of motion and whether any movements cause pain. Then, I’ll gently press on different areas of your hands and wrists to check for tenderness. I'll also do some simple tests to see how well your nerves are functioning, like checking your grip strength and sensation in your fingers. I will also palpate your spine and assess your back. The whole exam shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes. As for the imaging, we don't have to do it right away. I would like to see what the physical exam reveals first. If I feel imaging is necessary, we can discuss it further then. You'll have the opportunity to ask questions and make an informed decision. It will likely be an x-ray, and sometimes an MRI, but we can discuss the pros and cons of each. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: …Okay. That doesn’t sound… too bad. As long as you promise not to hurt me. And you'll tell me everything you find, right? No hiding things. Okay… let’s just get it over with. Where do I start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I absolutely promise I won't hurt you, and I'll explain everything I find in clear, understandable language. No hiding anything at all. Alright, let's begin. Could you please sit comfortably in the chair and let your arms relax by your sides?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m ready… I think. But… be gentle.
DOCTOR: I will be. To start, can you open and close your hands for me, making a tight fist and then stretching your fingers out as wide as you can?
PATIENT: There… like that? It hurts a little. Especially when I squeeze.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s helpful to know. And you're right, that is a bit tender. Now, let’s try some other movements. Can you bend your wrists up and down, like you're waving hello and goodbye?
PATIENT: Ouch! That one really hurts. It feels… tight. Like something is stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's enough for now. That indicates some possible inflammation. Now, let's check your grip strength. I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hand as tightly as you can. Just as hard as you’re comfortable with. No need to force it.
PATIENT: …Is that okay? It’s not very strong. It feels… clumsy. And it hurts when I try to squeeze.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It’s good that you told me. Your grip strength is somewhat reduced, which, along with the pain and limited range of motion, is concerning. Now, let's briefly assess your back. Could you stand up for me, if you’re comfortable?
PATIENT: …Okay. But it hurts when I stand. And it’s hard to keep my back straight. It just… wants to bend.
DOCTOR: I see. That's helpful to know. Now, can you gently bend forward and touch your toes, or as close as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ouch! That really hurts. I can’t go any further. It feels like something is stuck in my back. And my leg is tingling now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s enough for now. Please sit back down. It's clear that bending forward is causing you significant pain. Alright Ms. Fontanazza, based on the physical exam, I’m concerned about a few things. You have limited range of motion and tenderness in both your hands and your back. Your grip strength is reduced, and bending forward causes significant pain radiating down your leg. These findings suggest possible osteoarthritis in your hands, and possibly a lumbar strain or nerve impingement in your back. To confirm these findings and get a clearer picture, I recommend an x-ray of your hands and a lumbar spine MRI. Would you like me to explain what these imaging tests involve in more detail?
PATIENT: MRI? X-ray? …Are those safe? And what if… what if it’s really bad? What if I need… surgery? Please… tell me everything. Don't hide anything.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to be worried, Ms. Fontanazza. Let’s address your concerns one by one. First, both X-rays and MRIs are generally very safe. X-rays use a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. We use lead aprons to protect your body, and the amount of radiation is minimal. MRIs don’t use any radiation at all; they use magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your body. Now, let’s talk about what we might find. The imaging tests will help us determine the extent of the problem in your hands and back. If it is osteoarthritis, we can manage the pain with things like physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. Surgery is rarely necessary for osteoarthritis, and we would only consider it as a last resort. If it turns out to be a lumbar strain or nerve impingement in your back, we can also manage that with things like physical therapy, pain medication, and sometimes injections. Surgery is also rarely necessary for these conditions. I want to assure you that we will explore all non-surgical options first. The goal is to get you feeling better and back to doing the things you enjoy. I promise to explain everything every step of the way, and to answer any questions you have. I want to reiterate, I will not hide anything from you. Would you like me to go ahead and order these imaging tests for you?
PATIENT: …Okay. If you promise it’s not too dangerous. And if you promise you’ll tell me everything you find. And… will it be expensive? I don't have a lot of money. My husband… he works very hard. Please… help me. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise Ms. Fontanazza. The imaging tests are not dangerous, and I will tell you everything I find, no matter what. I understand your concern about the cost. I will see what assistance programs are available to help cover the costs of the imaging tests. Our billing department can also work with you to create a payment plan that fits your budget. I will have them reach out to you directly to discuss these options. We can start with the x-ray of your hands. Then, if needed, we can schedule the lumbar spine MRI. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Contrast… dyes? I don’t think so. I’ve never had any dyes before. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. My husband… he’s the one with allergies. He can’t eat shellfish. But I eat everything. I guess… I don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. In this case, we can proceed with the x-ray of your hands. I will send the order to the radiology department, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I would like to recommend that you take over-the-counter pain medication, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage your pain. You can also try applying ice to your hands and back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. I also recommend avoiding activities that aggravate your pain, such as lifting heavy objects or bending over. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please, help me feel better. My husband… he worries about me. And I just want to be able to work. Thank you… for listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I will do everything I can to help you feel better. We will work together, step by step, to get you back to doing the things you enjoy. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to support you. Here is a summary of our plan: 1. X-ray of hands: Scheduled through the radiology department. 2. Over-the-counter pain medication: Ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. 3. Ice packs: Apply to hands and back for 15-20 minutes at a time. 4. Avoid aggravating activities: Limit lifting and bending. We will discuss the results of the x-ray at your follow-up appointment. I'll have my staff contact you to schedule that once the results are available. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Rakosky. Thank you very much. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye.
