DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe I requested some paperwork? Something about… plans for the future, should I… well, should something happen. It’s all a bit vague, truthfully. I'm told it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I'm not entirely certain which is correct, or even what either means precisely.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you requested information regarding advance care planning. It can be a bit confusing, and that’s perfectly alright. Essentially, we’re talking about making sure your wishes are known if you ever become unable to speak for yourself. An Advance Directive is a broader document outlining your overall healthcare preferences, while a POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific medical order, usually for patients with serious illness. Let's start with understanding what's important to you. Do you have any existing documents, or is this entirely new territory?
PATIENT: Entirely new territory, I’m afraid. I… I don't recall ever having discussed anything like this with a doctor before. And honestly, the thought of it is a little unsettling. I suppose I’m mostly here because… well, a friend suggested I look into it. Said it would be responsible. I don’t disagree, I just… don't know where to begin. Is there a form I need to fill out? Perhaps seeing the questions would help me understand?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. It is a difficult topic to consider. And it's very responsible of you to be proactive about this. A friend suggesting it is a good reason to explore it, absolutely. Yes, there are forms, but we don't necessarily need to jump right into paperwork. Let's start with a conversation. We'll explore your values and wishes first, and then we can determine if completing a formal document—either an Advance Directive or a POLST—is the right step for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what’s important to you in terms of your overall health and quality of life?
PATIENT: That sounds… much less daunting, actually. Talking first. Yes, that’s good. What’s important… hmm. Well, I value my independence, above almost everything. I live alone, and I like it that way. I manage my own affairs, I keep my home as I like it. And I… I enjoy my work. Etching, you see. It requires a steady hand, and a clear mind. As for quality of life… being comfortable is important. Not necessarily luxurious, but… peaceful. And being able to continue doing what I enjoy, for as long as possible. Though, realistically, I suppose that’s what everyone wants. I’m not sure if that’s helpful. It feels rather… general.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Evann. Independence and maintaining your current lifestyle – especially your work – are key. And wanting comfort and peace is absolutely valid. It's not general at all – these are important priorities. Let’s think about scenarios, if you’re comfortable. If you were facing a serious illness, and medical interventions were needed, what would be most important to you?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I suppose… I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. No point in prolonging suffering. Though, defining ‘no hope’ is tricky, isn’t it? I wouldn’t want to give up easily. But I also wouldn’t want to be a burden, or to exist solely as a body being kept functioning by machines. It sounds terribly… bleak. And… I’m not sure I want every possible intervention attempted, even if it meant a small chance of extending my life. Quality of life, remember? I value that. Though, again, it's hard to know what I would feel in that situation. I hope that makes sense. I'm rambling, aren't I?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Evann. You’re articulating your thoughts and feelings very clearly, and those are perfectly reasonable concerns. It is difficult to think about, and it's perfectly normal to feel uncertain. You've touched on some very important points – wanting to avoid prolonged suffering, the importance of quality of life, and not wanting to be a burden. You also rightly pointed out the difficulty of defining "no hope." Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. If you were to become unable to make decisions for yourself, would you want your family involved in those decisions?
PATIENT: Family… that’s… complicated. I am divorced, and haven’t maintained close contact with my ex-husband for many years. We have… a strained relationship, to say the least. My parents are deceased. I have a cousin, but we’ve only met a handful of times. I wouldn’t trust any of them to make decisions on my behalf, truthfully. I… I prefer to think I could manage things myself, even if I were ill. Perhaps I should appoint a lawyer, someone impartial? Would that be possible? I’m not sure I want anyone making decisions for me, even with the best intentions. It feels… intrusive.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Evann. It’s important to have someone you trust, and it’s perfectly valid to not want family involved. Yes, absolutely. You can appoint a healthcare proxy – someone you designate to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. It doesn't have to be a family member. A lawyer, a close friend, or anyone you trust and who understands your wishes are all possibilities. Given your preference for maintaining control, and your concerns about family involvement, perhaps a comprehensive Advance Directive, outlining your specific wishes, would be the most appropriate step. We can also include a designated healthcare proxy. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That… yes. That sounds much better than a POLST form, at least. Specific wishes, and someone I choose to represent me. That feels… empowering, rather than frightening. So, what does that involve? Do I need to fill out a lengthy questionnaire? And is it possible to… revise it later, if my thoughts change? I worry about making a decision now, that I might regret in the future.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Evann. We'll proceed with the Advance Directive then. It does give you control. It doesn’t involve a lengthy questionnaire, thankfully. There's a standard form, but we’ll go through it together, section by section, and I’ll help you articulate your wishes in a clear and concise way. It’s more of a guided conversation, really. And absolutely, you can revise it at any time. Your wishes are not set in stone. As your thoughts and feelings change, we can update the document accordingly. It's a living document, meant to reflect your current values and preferences. I have a copy of the form here. Would you like me to walk you through it now, or would you prefer to take it home and read it over first?
PATIENT: Perhaps walking through it now would be best. I… I’m not sure I’d understand all the legal jargon on my own. And having you there to answer questions would be helpful. Though, I do apologize if I ask a lot of them. I’m rather… oblivious to these sorts of things.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. That’s precisely what I’m here for! Asking questions is encouraged. It’s important you understand everything completely. Alright. Let’s start with the first section, which is about identifying your healthcare proxy. This is the person you designate to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Have you already thought about who you might choose?
PATIENT: I… I have a friend, perhaps. Her name is Anya Petrova. She’s a librarian, very sensible and… level-headed. I’ve known her for many years. She’s always been… a voice of reason, I suppose. Would I need her to sign something as well? And is there a specific form she needs to fill out, acknowledging her role? I wouldn’t want to burden her with this without her full understanding.
DOCTOR: Anya Petrova, that sounds like a good choice. Sensible and level-headed are excellent qualities for a healthcare proxy. Yes, Anya will need to sign a form acknowledging her role, and confirming she understands her responsibilities. It's a separate document, and we’ll go through it together with her if she's available. It’s important she feels comfortable with the responsibility. Here, this section is where we’ll put her contact information. Then, on the next page, we’ll outline what types of decisions she’s authorized to make on your behalf. Do you have her phone number and address readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Just a moment… Anya Petrova. Address is… 14 Birchwood Lane, apartment 3B, here in the city. Phone number is… 555-1234. I believe that's correct. She doesn’t have an email address, she prefers to communicate in person, or by phone. A bit old-fashioned, perhaps, but reliable. Is that sufficient information? Or do you require anything else regarding her? I don't want to impose.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Evann. That’s all the information I need for now. Alright, now we move onto the core of the Advance Directive: outlining your wishes regarding medical treatment. This is where we discuss what types of interventions you would want, or not want, in various scenarios. We'll start with life-sustaining treatment. Do you have any initial thoughts on that topic?
PATIENT: Life-sustaining treatment… That sounds rather… ominous. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no reasonable hope of recovery. No machines, no tubes, if my brain function is severely compromised. Though, what constitutes ‘severely compromised’ is a difficult question, isn’t it? I wouldn’t want to be written off prematurely, but I also wouldn’t want to exist as a shell of myself. I’ve always believed in… a natural end. I suppose. Though, I understand there are exceptions. It’s all very complicated.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is very complicated. And it’s good you’re thinking about these things. "Severely compromised" is a common concern. Essentially, we're talking about a state where you wouldn’t be able to regain consciousness and wouldn’t have any meaningful interaction with your surroundings. The Advance Directive allows you to be very specific about your wishes. For example, we can state whether you would want a feeding tube, mechanical ventilation, or CPR performed in certain scenarios. We can also outline a timeframe for these interventions. Here, under “Life-Sustaining Treatment,” we can check boxes indicating your preferences. Would you like me to explain each option in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explaining each option would be very helpful. I wouldn't want to make a decision without fully understanding the implications. I suppose… mechanical ventilation and CPR sound rather… drastic. I’m not sure I would want either of those performed if there was no realistic chance of recovery. But a feeding tube… that sounds less invasive. Perhaps I would want that considered, even if my cognitive function was impaired. Though, again, I don't know. It’s all so confusing.
DOCTOR: It is confusing, and it’s perfectly alright to feel unsure. Let's break it down. Mechanical ventilation is essentially using a machine to help you breathe if you’re unable to do so on your own. CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation – involves chest compressions and rescue breathing to try to restart your heart if it stops beating. Both are considered aggressive interventions. A feeding tube provides nutrition and fluids directly into your stomach if you’re unable to eat or drink. It’s less invasive than ventilation or CPR, but it still has risks and benefits. Many people choose to have a feeding tube if they want to remain comfortable and nourished, even if they’re unable to eat normally. Under this section, you can indicate whether you would want each of these interventions performed, withheld, or if you want your healthcare proxy to make the decision based on your overall condition. Do you have any initial thoughts on which option you might prefer for each intervention?
PATIENT: I think… I would prefer to withhold mechanical ventilation and CPR if there was no realistic chance of recovery. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of regaining consciousness or quality of life. As for the feeding tube… I think I would want my healthcare proxy to make that decision, based on my overall condition. If I was still able to experience some level of comfort or enjoyment, even with impaired cognitive function, perhaps it would be beneficial. But if I was in a vegetative state, with no prospect of improvement, I wouldn’t want it prolonged. Is that… clear? I’m afraid I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Evann. You’re articulating your wishes very clearly. And this is excellent – those are very specific and thoughtful preferences. So, we’ll indicate “withhold” for mechanical ventilation and CPR, and “healthcare proxy decision” for the feeding tube. Now, let's move on to another important aspect: pain management. Do you have any specific wishes regarding pain relief?
PATIENT: Pain management… That’s a difficult one. I… I don't want to be in pain, obviously. But I also don’t want to be heavily medicated, to the point where I’m unable to communicate or experience any level of awareness. I think… I would want to be kept comfortable, with adequate pain relief, but I wouldn’t want it to mask any underlying symptoms that might indicate a change in my condition. And I wouldn't want to be sedated to the point of unconsciousness. Is that… possible? I suppose it’s a delicate balance.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Evann. It is a delicate balance, and you're expressing exactly what many people want. Adequate pain relief without losing awareness or masking important symptoms. We absolutely can document that. Here, under "Pain Management," we can state your preferences regarding the use of pain medication. We can specify whether you want it administered proactively, or only as needed, and we can also state your concerns about side effects or loss of awareness. Would you like me to read some of the options aloud, or would you prefer to discuss it further?
PATIENT: Perhaps discussing it further would be best. I suppose… I would want it administered proactively, to prevent any unnecessary suffering. But I would also want my healthcare proxy to be vigilant about any side effects, and to advocate for a lower dosage if I was experiencing any unwanted symptoms. And I wouldn’t want to be heavily sedated, even if it meant some level of discomfort. Is that clear enough? I’m afraid I’m being rather… verbose.
DOCTOR: No, not verbose at all, Evann. You're being very thorough and thoughtful, which is exactly what we want. It’s important to be specific. So, we’ll document "proactive pain management, with vigilance regarding side effects and a preference for lower dosages, and no heavy sedation." We’re almost finished, Evann. Just a few more questions. Do you have any specific wishes regarding your end-of-life care?
PATIENT: End-of-life care… That’s… difficult to think about. I… I don’t want to be alone. If possible, I would like my friend, Anya, to be present. And I would prefer to be in a quiet, peaceful environment. Not a hospital, if possible. Perhaps my own home, or a hospice facility. I don’t have any religious requirements, or any specific funeral arrangements. I just want to be comfortable, and to be surrounded by peace. And… I would like my possessions to be donated to charity. I don’t want to burden anyone with sorting through them. Is that… sufficient? I’m afraid I’m being rather morbid.
DOCTOR: No, not morbid at all, Evann. It’s important to express your wishes, and these are very reasonable preferences. So, we’ll document “presence of friend Anya Petrova, preference for quiet, peaceful environment, no religious requirements, possessions to be donated to charity.” And that’s it, Evann. We’ve covered everything. I’m going to print this out for you to review, and to sign. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been… incredibly patient, and helpful. I was very anxious about this, but you’ve made it much easier. Thank you. One question, if you don’t mind. After I sign this, what happens next? Does it get sent to a central registry, or do I need to provide a copy to my healthcare proxy and my doctor? I just want to make sure it’s properly documented.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I'm glad I could help. It's completely understandable to be anxious about this, and you did a wonderful job articulating your wishes. After you sign it, you'll keep the original. It's best to provide copies to your healthcare proxy – Anya Petrova – and to your primary care physician – that's me. It should also be included in your medical record. I'll make a note of it in your chart, as well. And, of course, you can always update this document if your wishes change. Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been… a great help. I feel much more at ease now, knowing that my wishes are properly documented. I appreciate your patience and understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure. And remember, if any questions or concerns arise in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a good day.
