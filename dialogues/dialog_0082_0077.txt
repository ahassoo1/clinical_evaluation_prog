DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh. Morning to you too. They told me to come. Some testin’ after… after all them years in the mine. No problem feelin’ though, I assure you. Strong as an elephant, still! But the young people… always worryin’.
DOCTOR: Right, testing after your time in the mine. That's good to hear you’re feeling strong, Mr. Bigger. It's always best to be thorough, though, you’re right. Just routine, likely. Could you tell me a bit more about what kind of tests were mentioned?
PATIENT: Tests? Hmm. They just said “check you for dust.” Dust in the lungs, I think. Somethin’ like that. Been breathin’ dust for fifty years, you know? Coal dust, rock dust… all sorts. Never bothered me none. You think a little dust will stop a man like me?
DOCTOR: No, I certainly don’t think a little dust will stop you, Mr. Bigger. But it’s good to check, even if you feel fine. We want to make sure everything is as healthy as it can be. Do you currently have any trouble breathing at all?
PATIENT: Trouble breathin’? No! I can still shout louder than most young men. And I still carry heavy things, you know. Heavy, heavy things. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to say I was stubborn as a mule. But strong. Very strong. No trouble breathin’ at all.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Bigger. Very good. And it sounds like you've kept very active over the years. Just to be complete, have you noticed any cough recently?
PATIENT: Cough? Eh… sometimes. Old man cough, you know? Everybody gets one. Especially in the cold season. Just a little tickle in the throat. Nothing serious. Like clearin’ your throat, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tickle in the throat, especially in the cold season. And is that cough... does it bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Bring somethin’ up? Sometimes. A little… spit. Clear spit. Not… not blood or nothin’ like that. Just spit. Like when you wake up in the mornin’, you know? Old man things.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear spit, especially in the mornings. And have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I eat like a horse, you know! Always have. My wife used to complain I ate too much. No, no weight loss. Maybe a little… when she passed. Hard to eat when your heart is breakin’, you understand? But I’ve put it back on. Definitely put it back on.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bigger. That’s very common. So, generally, your appetite is good now, and you haven't noticed any unintentional weight loss. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… hmm. Doctor told me somethin’ once, long time ago. Said my numbers were a little high. Gave me a pill. I took it for a bit, but… felt funny. Stopped takin’ it. Felt better without it. No problems since. Diabetes? No. Never had diabetes. Heart problems… well, heart breakin’ is a problem, but not the kind a doctor fixes!
DOCTOR: Alright, so you were diagnosed with slightly high blood pressure at some point, but you stopped taking the medication. And no diabetes or heart problems, aside from grief. Do you recall what the doctor said your blood pressure was, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Eh… numbers… they all blur together after a while. He said somethin’ about “one-forty over ninety” maybe? Or was it “one-fifty”? I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and I didn’t pay much attention. I felt fine. That’s all that mattered to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly around 140/90 or 150/90. And you didn’t experience any side effects from the medication, just didn’t like the way it made you feel. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… No. Never had surgery. Not a one. I’m a tough old bird, you know? Never needed cuttin’ open. A few broken bones when I was young – fell off a roof once – but they healed on their own. No need for doctors messin’ with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you healed well from any broken bones without needing medical intervention. Now, thinking about your family… are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Parents? Long gone. Both of them. Passed away when I was still a young man. I was… I was on my own for a long time. But I made somethin' of myself, you know? Despite it all.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Bigger. Did either of your parents have any health problems, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Health problems… hmm. My father… he worked in the fields. Hard work. He got sick, somethin' with his lungs, coughin' a lot at the end. But I was young, didn’t understand much. My mother… she was a strong woman, but her heart wasn’t strong. She passed quickly. That’s all I really remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, your father had some lung problems with a cough, and your mother had heart problems. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I’m a man of simple tastes. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. Tough as nails, remember? Maybe a little sniffle sometimes when the dust gets bad, but that’s just dust.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to confirm, you are currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. I don't take nothin'. Pills are for weak people. I got by just fine on my own for eighty-six years, and I ain’t about to start now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, would you mind if I listened to your lungs and took your blood pressure just to get a baseline?
PATIENT: Go ahead. But don’t expect nothin’ fancy. I told you, I’m as strong as an elephant. I bet your machine will have trouble readin’ my numbers.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a listen. Deep breath in… and out… and again… good. Your lungs sound… a little quiet, but clear overall. I do hear some slight crackling at the bases, which could be normal, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Hmph. See? I told you I was strong. That machine better not break.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 160 over 95. And your pulse is 78, regular. It is a little elevated, Mr. Bigger, as we discussed. We'll want to monitor that. But as you said, you’re a strong man. Now, before we discuss a plan, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Elevated, eh? I knew it. My numbers are always high when them machines poke at me. Still feelin’ fine, though. Hmm… questions? No. Not really. Just tell me I ain’t dyin’ and I’ll be on my way.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bigger, you are certainly not dying. Your blood pressure is a little high, but that doesn’t mean you’re unwell. It simply means we need to keep an eye on it and potentially discuss ways to manage it. Given your history, and the fact that you've stopped medication in the past, I recommend we start with lifestyle modifications. That means a healthy diet, regular exercise, and reducing stress. We can also check your blood pressure again in a few weeks to see if it has come down on its own. Would you be comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I eat what I want, when I want. And exercise? I work! That’s exercise enough. Stress? Bah. I’ve lived through a lot. Can’t stress me out now. Look, Doc. I ain’t changin’ nothin’. I feel fine. I’m a simple man. Just tell me when to come back and poke at me again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I respect your wishes. In that case, let's schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your blood pressure. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches in the meantime, please don't hesitate to come in sooner. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Three months, eh? Fine. Three months. As long as I don't have to take no pills. Chest pain? Shortness of breath? I’m tougher than that, Doc. No questions. Just write it down and I’ll be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I've noted everything. The nurse will schedule that appointment for you before you leave. It was nice meeting you today. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
PATIENT: You too, Doc. And don’t worry about me. I’ll be alright. I always am. .
