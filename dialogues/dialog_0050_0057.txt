DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luft. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you about it.
DOCTOR: I see. And who informed you of this… cancer diagnosis, Ms. Luft?
PATIENT: It was Doctor… Miller, at the hospital. He did some tests a few weeks ago, and then he called me with the news. It was… a lot to take in, honestly. I’m still trying to understand everything.
DOCTOR: Dr. Miller, yes. I see his referrals frequently. And what specifically did Dr. Miller tell you about this… finding?
PATIENT: He said… it was in my lung. He used some big words, I didn’t really catch them all. Something about a growth… and needing to find out what kind it is. He said that's why he wanted me to come see you. I'm sorry, I don't remember all the details. It was a scary phone call.
DOCTOR: Quite understandable, Ms. Luft. Medical terminology can be… cumbersome for the layperson. A growth in the lung… that is concerning, certainly. Do you happen to recall anything about the size of this growth, or where in the lung it was located?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think he mentioned the size. He did say it was… on the upper part of my right lung? I think that’s what he said. But I was so focused on the word “cancer” I honestly didn't ask a lot of questions. I should have, I know.
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to be overwhelmed in such a situation. We'll certainly get to the bottom of everything. Now, Ms. Luft, to give me a clearer picture, let's go through some general health questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, I had pneumonia when I was a little girl. And… oh. My husband, he passed away last year, and he had diabetes. I’m not sure if that matters? I haven't been diagnosed with anything myself, aside from that childhood pneumonia.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia is noted. And your husband’s diabetes… while not directly relevant to you, it's helpful information to have regarding family history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. I’ve been pretty healthy, aside from that sickness when I was young. That's why this is all so shocking, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your surprise, Ms. Luft. Now, let's discuss any medications you are currently taking. Do you take any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins regularly?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. That’s it. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, so I figured that was enough. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things, and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Ms. Luft, I'd like to get a bit of your social history, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I’ve never smoked. My husband tried it for a little while when he was younger, but I always asked him to stop, and he did. It just never appealed to me. It’s bad for your health.
DOCTOR: That is… prudent. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, I promise. Just a little bit to relax.
DOCTOR: Noted. Now, Ms. Luft, can you describe your occupation?
PATIENT: I'm an Occupational Therapist. I help people recover from injuries and illnesses, get back to their daily lives. It's... it's a good job, usually. Though it's been hard since… well, since my husband passed and now this.
DOCTOR: I see. A demanding profession, I imagine. Now, finally, Ms. Luft, regarding family history… have any of your immediate family members – parents, siblings – had cancer or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: My mother passed away when I was young, from… heart problems, I think. And my father… he had high blood pressure, but that’s about it. No one else in my family has had cancer, as far as I know. It really came as a shock, to be honest. This whole thing.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Luft. Thank you for that detailed information. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. We will start with listening to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. I am listening for any unusual sounds.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: I am gently tapping on your chest to assess the underlying tissue. Any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No, sir. That doesn’t hurt. It just feels… strange. I'm a little nervous, but it's not painful.
DOCTOR: I am checking for any swelling in your lymph nodes. Again, please inform me if you feel any discomfort. Auscultation revealed slightly diminished breath sounds in the upper lobe of the right lung. Percussion was resonant, but there was some slight tenderness upon palpation of the supraclavicular lymph nodes. The nodes themselves are not significantly enlarged, but are somewhat firm to the touch. This is… concerning, but not definitive. We will need to perform some imaging to get a clearer picture. Now, Ms. Luft, based on your history and the preliminary physical exam findings, I recommend a chest X-ray and a CT scan of the chest. This will help us determine the size, location, and nature of the growth. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A CT scan? That sounds… serious. What will it show, exactly? And… will it hurt? I’m not really good with hospitals and tests. This is all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Luft. A CT scan is a more detailed imaging study than an X-ray. It utilizes X-rays, but takes cross-sectional images, allowing us to visualize the lung and surrounding structures with greater clarity. It will show us the size, shape, and location of the growth, as well as any involvement of nearby lymph nodes or other tissues. It is not particularly painful. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. You will need to remain still during the scan, which typically takes about 15-20 minutes. A contrast dye may be administered intravenously to enhance the images, which some patients experience as a warming sensation. There is a small risk of allergic reaction to the dye, which is why we will ask you some questions beforehand. We'll take all necessary precautions. The primary purpose of these tests is to gather more information so we can determine the best course of action. Without a clear understanding of what we are dealing with, we cannot formulate an appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: A warming sensation… and an allergic reaction? I… I don't know if I can. I get very anxious in medical settings. And I'm still processing the cancer part. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe a different test? Something less… scary?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties, Ms. Luft. We will certainly proceed at a pace that is comfortable for you. While a biopsy would ultimately be necessary for a definitive diagnosis, it's premature at this stage, and we can hold off on that for now. Alternative imaging options are limited. A PET scan could be considered, but it’s more expensive and doesn’t provide the same level of detail as a CT scan. However, given your anxiety, we could start with the chest X-ray. This will provide a less detailed, but still useful, image of your lung. If the X-ray reveals a concerning finding, we can then discuss the possibility of a CT scan with a referral to radiology that specializes in patient comfort and anxiety reduction. They have resources available to help manage your fears, including sedation if necessary. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Sedation… that sounds… better. Much better. If they can help me stay calm, I think I could do it. So, just the X-ray first, and then maybe the CT scan if the X-ray shows something? And a specialist who can help with the anxiety?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We will start with the chest X-ray. I will write a referral for you to radiology, specifically requesting Dr. Eleanor Vance. She has an excellent reputation for patient comfort and utilizes various anxiety-reducing techniques. She also has experience with conscious sedation, if that becomes necessary. I will also provide you with a contact number for their patient support line. Now, while we wait for the results of the X-ray, is there anything else I can address for you?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you for listening and understanding. And for not pushing me too hard. I really appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Luft. My priority is to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes respecting your concerns and anxieties. We will proceed at a pace that is comfortable for you. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your X-ray appointment. I will see you again after the results are available, to discuss the next steps. Have a good day, Ms. Luft.
