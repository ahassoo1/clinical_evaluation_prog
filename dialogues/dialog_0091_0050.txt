DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor… Delacour, is it? Yes, good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… Oh, right. This cough. It just… won’t go away. Been hacking for a while now. Feels dry, mostly. Not much… phlegm, you know? Just… irritating. It’s been going on for… a good spell, I reckon. Can’t rightly say how long, though. Time gets away from you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. A persistent cough can be quite bothersome. You mentioned it’s been going on for “a good spell” – would you say it’s been several weeks, or closer to a few months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… several months, I think. Maybe even longer? It’s hard to say for sure. My memory… isn’t what it used to be. My wife, bless her soul, she always kept track of things like that. Since she’s… gone… it all blurs together a bit. I just know it’s been a long time, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better on its own.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure of the exact timeframe. Losing track of time is common, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. We'll do our best to figure things out. Aside from the duration, has anything specific seemed to make the cough worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific things… Let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It seems to bother me… more when I lie down, maybe? And… sometimes when the weather changes. Gets colder, or… wetter. But mostly, it's just there. Constant. Doesn't really matter what I'm doing. I used to work on cars, you know. Lots of dust and fumes back then… could it be something from that? It was a long time ago, though. A very long time.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Pavlovic. The fact that it worsens when lying down and with weather changes is helpful. And yes, your history of working on cars with exposure to dust and fumes is relevant. We'll certainly consider that. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you describe any other symptoms you've been experiencing alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… I get a little… short of breath sometimes. Not all the time, just when I… exert myself, I suppose. Like climbing stairs. Or… walking a long distance. And… I’ve been feeling a bit more tired lately, I guess. Just… generally run down. Oh, and my appetite hasn’t been very good either. Everything just… tastes bland. Not much flavor to anything anymore. I don't know if those things are connected, though. Could just be getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Those are all important details, Mr. Pavlovic. Shortness of breath with exertion, fatigue, and a decreased appetite are certainly things we need to investigate further. It's good you're sharing all of this with me. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The doctor… back when my wife was still alive… he checked me up every year. I don't… recall ever being diagnosed with anything, no. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was a young man. But that was… decades ago. And I think I had the flu a couple of times, but that's about it. I always thought I was a pretty healthy man, for my age. Worked hard all my life. Didn't spend much time feeling sick. Except for this cough, of course. It’s… different. This feels… deeper, somehow. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Pavlovic. And thank you for sharing that. A history of pneumonia is good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… Let me think. Now, there was that time I broke my arm when I was a boy. Fell out of a tree. They… set it, I think. But I don’t think that was a full-blown surgery, just… a cast, maybe? And… no, I don’t recall any other surgeries. Never been a fan of hospitals, if I’m honest. Tried to avoid them whenever possible. My wife was the one who always went to the doctor. I just… toughed things out. Back in my day, we didn’t go to the doctor for every little thing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pavlovic. A broken arm that was set is good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung cancer, or emphysema?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tough one. My family… we didn’t talk much about those things. My parents… they’re both gone now, a long time ago. And I don’t have any siblings. My wife’s family… they were… healthy people, I think. She had an aunt who had… something with her heart, maybe? But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn't keep track of things like that. We just… lived our lives, you know? Didn’t spend much time worrying about what might happen. It’s all a bit blurry now, to be honest. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s common for family medical history to be unclear, especially with time. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she didn’t like it. Said it was bad for your health. And I always agreed with her. Always tried to stay healthy. Worked hard, ate good food, and avoided things that were bad for me. I did… drink a little beer sometimes, with my meals. But nothing excessive. Just… a couple of glasses. And I haven’t had any in… well, since my wife passed away. Didn’t seem right, drinking without her.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. That’s good to know. And I appreciate you sharing that personal detail about not drinking since your wife’s passing. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never really had any reactions to anything. I’ve taken some pills over the years, for headaches or… aches and pains. But nothing serious. Never had any rashes or… trouble breathing or anything like that. My wife… she was allergic to bee stings, I think. Had to carry a little shot with her, just in case. But I never had any allergies myself. Nothing I can recall, anyway. I always thought I was pretty lucky, that way. Not much bothered me. Until this cough, of course. It’s… a persistent one. A real bother.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Pavlovic. No known allergies is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. I stopped taking my blood pressure pills a while back. The doctor… said I didn't need them anymore. Everything was under control, he said. And I don't take any supplements or anything like that. Always preferred to just… let nature take its course. I ate good food, got enough sleep, and tried to stay active. That's always been my philosophy. But this cough… it’s just not going away. And I’m starting to worry about it. It feels… different than anything I’ve ever experienced before. Perhaps a checkup is in order, yes?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Pavlovic. A checkup is a very good idea. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, please. I’m just… an old man, after all. Been through a lot in my life. A little exam won’t bother me none. Just… be gentle, if you would. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And… thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It’s… nice to have someone pay attention. It gets lonely, you know. Especially since… well, never mind. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Just breathe deeply in and out for me. Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Your lungs sound a little… congested, with some crackling sounds, mostly at the bottom. Your heart sounds regular, and your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Your throat looks a little irritated, but nothing alarming. I also want to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s a little lower than we’d like, but not critically low. Given your age and symptoms, I think we should get a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other lung conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… yes, that sounds… thorough. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I just… want to know what’s going on. This cough… it’s been bothering me for so long. And I don’t want it to get any worse. 92%… is that bad? My wife… she always worried about those numbers. I just want to feel better, you know? To be able to… breathe easy again. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead with the X-ray. Just… let me know what you find, alright? I’m… a bit worried, to be honest. But I trust you.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Pavlovic. 92% is a little lower than ideal, but it's not an emergency on its own. However, given your cough, fatigue, and age, it’s best to investigate further. We’ll get that X-ray ordered right away. The radiology department is just down the hall. I’ll have a nurse escort you. Once the X-ray is done, we’ll review the results together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’m going to order a complete blood count, just to check for any signs of infection. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… Hmm. I don't think so. My wife… she had some tests done once, and I think they used something like that. She didn't have any problems, as far as I recall. But I never had any dye myself, so I don't know if I'm allergic or not. I just… don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. I've always been pretty lucky, that way. A complete blood count… yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please let me know what you find, alright? I'm starting to get a little anxious, to be honest. This cough… it's been lingering for so long. And I don't want it to be anything serious. A nurse escorting me… yes, that would be very helpful. My legs aren't what they used to be. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. We’ll proceed cautiously. Since you haven’t had contrast dye before, we’ll use a non-contrast X-ray. That means no dye will be used at all. I’ll have the nurse escort you to radiology, and she’ll explain the procedure to you in more detail. Once the X-ray is done, we’ll review the results together. It may take a little while for the results to come back. In the meantime, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, no. I haven’t been taking my temperature, to be honest. I just… haven’t felt hot or anything. Chills… maybe a little bit sometimes, when the weather is cold. But nothing severe. And night sweats… no, I haven’t been sweating much at night. I usually sleep pretty soundly, actually. Until this cough… it wakes me up sometimes. But I don’t sweat much. I usually wake up feeling… just tired. And a little… achy, maybe. But no fever, no chills, no night sweats. Just… tired. And this persistent cough. It’s… been a long spell, you know? A very long spell. I just want to know what’s going on, Doctor. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. No fever, chills, or night sweats is good to know. The fatigue and cough are certainly concerning, and we're working to find the cause. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, a little bit, maybe? My ankles… they do feel a little puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. I just thought it was… old age, you know? I usually put my feet up when I get home, and that helps. But yes, a little bit of swelling. Nothing severe, but it’s been happening more lately. My wife… she used to rub them for me, and that helped too. But… she’s gone now. So… it’s a little worse, maybe? I just thought it was… getting older. But yes, a little swelling in my ankles. Is that bad, Doctor? It’s not painful, just… puffy.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Mr. Pavlovic. The ankle swelling is something we should investigate further. It could be related to your cough, or it could be a separate issue. Now, before the nurse arrives, is there anything else at all that you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Oh! Yes. My appetite… it’s been very poor lately. Everything just… tastes bland. I used to love to eat, but now… I just don’t have much of an appetite. I’ve lost a little weight, I think. But I haven’t weighed myself recently. And… I’ve been feeling a little more short of breath lately, even when I’m just… sitting still. It’s not severe, but it’s noticeable. And… I’ve been feeling a little… down, to be honest. Since my wife passed away… it’s been hard. I try to stay positive, but… it’s not always easy. Oh, and… sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up quickly. But that doesn’t happen very often. Is that… is that too much information, Doctor? I just… want you to know everything, so you can help me. I trust you.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Pavlovic, that is not too much information at all. In fact, it’s very helpful. The decreased appetite, weight loss, shortness of breath, feeling down, and dizziness are all important details. Okay, Mr. Pavlovic. It sounds like we have a lot to consider. Given your history of a persistent cough, fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, ankle swelling, and decreased appetite, I think we need to rule out several possibilities, including pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The X-ray will be a good starting point, and the complete blood count will help us look for signs of infection. I’m going to order an EKG, as well, to check your heart rhythm. I want you to know that we're going to take good care of you. We'll run some tests, figure out what's going on, and come up with a plan to get you feeling better. Here’s the nurse, Sarah. She’ll escort you to radiology for the X-ray. Sarah, please make sure Mr. Pavlovic is comfortable and explain the procedure to him in detail. And Mr. Pavlovic, don't hesitate to let either of us know if you have any questions or concerns. Let's get this taken care of, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I… appreciate your kindness. It’s… nice to have someone listen. I trust you and the nurse, Sarah. Just… let me know what you find, alright? I’m… a bit worried, but I’m also… hopeful. Lead the way, please. I’m ready when you are. Just… take it slow, alright? My legs aren’t what they used to be. And… thank you again, Doctor. I’m… grateful for your help. This cough… it’s been a long spell. A very long spell. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. Sarah will take excellent care of you. And I’ll be here when you return to discuss the results. Please, take your time, and don't hesitate to ask Sarah any questions you may have. Sarah, please make sure Mr. Pavlovic is comfortable during the X-ray and that you explain everything to him in detail. And if he expresses any concerns, please let me know immediately. We’ll be right here, Mr. Pavlovic. Take care.
