DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Annesley. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, a lot of pressure in my bladder, and it's become quite bothersome. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a lot of pressure in your bladder” for a few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not necessarily painful, exactly. More… a constant feeling of fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. It feels like I need to go much more often than I used to, and sometimes it's difficult to… completely empty my bladder, if that makes sense. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant feeling of fullness and difficulty emptying – those are important details. And you said it's been happening for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately three weeks, I believe. It started gradually, just noticing I was going a little more often. Then it progressed to this feeling of… incomplete emptying and the constant pressure. It hasn't been sudden, thankfully. More a slow build-up. I can recall the exact date it started if that's helpful – July 12th, after a long car ride with my husband.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, actually – July 12th after a long car ride. We'll make a note of that. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no pain in my back, thankfully. I have noticed I’m drinking about the same amount of water as usual, maybe a little less because I’m trying to avoid needing to go too often. And… now that I mention it, I’ve felt a bit more tired lately, but I assumed that was just work stress. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no back pain, drinking about the same, and a bit more tired. Fatigue can be relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Certainly. I was diagnosed with mild asthma as a child, but it’s been very well-controlled with an inhaler for years – I rarely need it now. Aside from that, nothing significant, thankfully. No surgeries, no major illnesses. I do have Medicare, as I mentioned earlier, and I see my primary care doctor regularly for check-ups. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor? Perhaps allergies or… anything my family has a history of?
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled asthma is good to know. And no other medical conditions, no surgeries. Let's ask about allergies – do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I eat pretty much everything. My husband always checks when we go to new restaurants, just to be safe, but I haven’t had any issues. I don’t have any known environmental allergies either – no hay fever, no reactions to animals, nothing like that. I can't recall ever experiencing an allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: That's good. No known allergies. Let's quickly go over your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like bladder problems, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had type 2 diabetes, but she managed it well with diet and exercise for many years. My grandmother on my father’s side had some issues with urinary incontinence as she got older, but I don’t know the specifics. And… my uncle on my mother's side had kidney stones, but that was a one-time thing, as far as I know. Nothing else that immediately comes to mind. I can ask my mother if there is anything else she recalls.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Diabetes in your mother, incontinence in your grandmother, and kidney stones in your uncle. Now, one more quick question before we move on to a physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a graphic designer, mostly from home, so I spend a lot of time sitting at a computer. I try to take breaks and walk around, but it's not ideal, I admit. My husband and I enjoy gardening in our spare time, and we try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables. We don’t smoke, and we only drink alcohol occasionally, usually a glass of wine with dinner. I wouldn’t describe myself as particularly active, but I'm not completely sedentary either. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good information. Sitting for long periods is something we'll keep in mind. Okay, Marialena, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam now, if you don't mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick external examination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand. Please, proceed when you're ready. I'll do my best to be still.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm going to gently press on your lower abdomen to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt, Doctor. Just a little pressure, but no pain at all. It feels… normal, I suppose. Like a regular examination. It's not tender, or anything like that. I can feel a bit of… fullness, perhaps, but that’s probably just what I’ve been describing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness noted. Now, I’m going to quickly check your reflexes. Both reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72. Everything appears normal so far. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture, just to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Absolutely, a urinalysis and urine culture would be perfectly alright. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Do I need to go to a separate lab for that, or can it be done here?
DOCTOR: You can do it right here in the clinic, Marialena. I’ll give you a container and instructions. Just collect a midstream sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream into the container, and finish urinating. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds straightforward enough, Doctor. Mid-stream sample, I understand. I believe I can manage that without any issues. Would you like me to go ahead and do that now? Or is there anything else you'd like to check before I do?
DOCTOR: You can go ahead and do that now. It will only take a few minutes. I'll be right here when you're finished, and we can discuss the next steps. Take your time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
