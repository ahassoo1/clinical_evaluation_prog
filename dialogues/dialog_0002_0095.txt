DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day for this. I woke up this morning and I can't hear out of my left ear. And half my face feels...droopy. It's quite alarming, really. I expect you've seen this before?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Not having time is definitely frustrating, and those symptoms are alarming, so you're right to get them checked out quickly. It’s good you came in. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… those need to be taken seriously. Just to be clear, it was this morning you noticed both the hearing loss and the drooping?
PATIENT: Yes, this morning. I went to make my tea, and that’s when I realized I couldn’t hear the kettle. Then, when I looked in the mirror...well, it wasn't a pretty sight. It all happened very quickly. I don’t usually bother with doctors, but this is… noticeable. I was hoping for a quick diagnosis and something to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, very quickly this morning. And you said half your face feels droopy – can you tell me specifically where on your face you're noticing that?
PATIENT: It's mostly on the left side, naturally. Around my mouth, mostly. And my cheek feels… lower. It's difficult to explain. It’s just not symmetrical. I know my face, and this isn’t it. Are you going to poke and prod at it now? I really don't have the patience for a lengthy examination.
DOCTOR: I understand. We will do an exam, but I'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s important to assess exactly where the weakness is, and how significant it is. It helps narrow down what might be going on. First, let me take a quick look in your ears just to rule out anything obvious. Then I'll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and maybe stick your tongue out, just to see how things move. Sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. But if you find something unpleasant in my ear, please don’t dwell on it. I have a low tolerance for… detailed descriptions of bodily functions. And hurry, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking in your ear now… It appears clear, no obvious obstruction or infection. Okay, smile for me, please. And now raise your eyebrows as high as you can. And stick your tongue out. Okay. I do notice some weakness on the left side of your face, as you described. It's most pronounced around your mouth and cheek. Your forehead seems a bit less affected, which is… noteworthy. It’s not a complete paralysis, but it’s definitely a weakness. Your tongue movement looks normal, thankfully. I'm going to check your reflexes quickly, just to get a more complete picture. It will just be a tap on your knee and a quick check of your eyes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Honestly. Are you sure this is necessary? It feels like you're just trying to prolong this. Very well, do your tapping. But be gentle, I bruise easily. And don't tell me about the science of reflexes, I haven’t got time for a lecture.
DOCTOR: Alright, quick tap on your knee… and the other side. Okay, and I'm just going to check your eyes briefly… looking for any subtle movements. Okay, everything seems… relatively normal there. Given the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, and the pattern of weakness we're seeing, the most concerning possibility is Bell's Palsy. It’s a condition where there’s inflammation of the facial nerve. However, it is critical to rule out other causes, especially stroke. We need to be thorough. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Stroke? Now you’re frightening me. I don’t feel ill, if that’s what you’re asking. No headache, no dizziness, no trouble speaking. Just the ear and the face. And frankly, a growing irritation with this entire process. Is Bell's Palsy something serious? Will I be left permanently disfigured? I have a garden party next week.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – no headache, dizziness, or trouble speaking. Those are important things. I understand your concern about stroke, and I want to be upfront: that’s why we need to be careful. But the fact that you don’t have those other symptoms makes stroke less likely. Bell's Palsy can be serious, in the sense that it can affect your ability to eat, drink, and speak properly. And, yes, it can sometimes lead to permanent weakness, but that’s not usually the case. Most people recover fully, especially if treatment is started quickly. To be absolutely sure, I'd like to get some bloodwork done. And, ideally, a scan of your brain - just to rule out anything more serious. Given your concerns, and the sudden onset, I really think it's the safest course of action. Would you be able to go to the hospital for a CT scan today?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh, for goodness sake. This is becoming ridiculous. I came in for a quick diagnosis, not a prolonged medical investigation. Hospital? I have things to do. I suppose if it will rule things out… but I expect you to expedite this as much as possible. I don't want to spend all day waiting around. And will this scan tell you definitively if it's this “Bell's Palsy”? And what does treatment even involve? Honestly, the thought of needles…
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, and I am trying to expedite things as much as possible. The CT scan will help rule out other possibilities, like a stroke or a tumor, which is the most important thing right now. It's a relatively quick scan. As for Bell’s Palsy treatment, it typically involves a course of steroids, usually prednisone, to reduce the inflammation. It’s given orally, so no needles unless you absolutely require it. Sometimes antiviral medications are used as well. We’d also discuss eye drops to protect your eye, as you may not be able to blink properly on the affected side, which can cause dryness and irritation. I’m going to write a referral for the scan and a script for the steroids, just in case. I also want you to go to the emergency room immediately after the scan, just so they can monitor you closely. The emergency room doctors will determine if the scan is needed immediately and, based on the scan results, will advise on the next steps. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Fine. But I'm warning you, if this turns out to be nothing, I expect an apology. And a full explanation for this unnecessary disruption of my schedule. Give me the referral and the script. And please, make sure the hospital knows I'm coming and that I’m not to be kept waiting for hours. My time is valuable. And tell them I require a private room. This whole experience is rather distressing. Is there anything else? I sincerely hope not. Let’s get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I've written a note for the hospital explaining the situation, requesting they prioritize your scan and provide a private room. I understand this is distressing, and I'm truly sorry for the disruption to your schedule. I want to reassure you that we're taking this very seriously and are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of it quickly. I'll also include my direct contact information in case you have any questions or concerns. Just to reiterate: if you experience any new symptoms – like severe headache, trouble speaking, weakness in other parts of your body, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately, regardless of your appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
