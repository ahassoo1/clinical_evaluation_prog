DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a check-up, really. My husband… he always took care of these things. Since he passed… I think it is time I make sure I am okay. It is for Medicare, you know? A remote check-up, they said.
DOCTOR: Right, a routine check-up. And it’s good you’re thinking of this now. It's wise to be proactive. Just to be clear, is there anything specific that prompted you to schedule this appointment, or are you generally just wanting a full assessment to establish a baseline?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Not really. I feel… alright, I think. Maybe a little tired sometimes. But I am getting older, yes? It is hard to say what is normal and what is… not. I do a lot of work in the garage, fixing cars. It keeps me busy, you know. But maybe that is tiring me out? I don’t know. It is… confusing to think about.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap my pen against the chart, a slightly dismissive expression on my face. Fixing cars... really?
PATIENT: You fix cars? That’s… quite active work for a check-up. Okay. So, no new pains, no trouble breathing, no big changes? Just tiredness, and you're wondering if the car work is the cause? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… a fair summary. Although, truthfully, ‘tiredness’ is a rather vague symptom. Can you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Vague, yes. I… it is not like I can’t do things. I just… feel drained afterward. Like all my energy is gone. Even after a good night of sleep, sometimes it takes a while to feel… awake. And I work with… heavy things, you know? Lifting, bending. It is not easy work. I used to do it with my husband, but now it is just me. Perhaps I am just not as strong as I was.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this fatigue been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It was not… one day, suddenly tired. More… slowly, over the past year. Maybe since my husband… passed, even. It is hard to say. I was… preoccupied then, you know? Everything felt… different. The tiredness could have been there all along, and I just didn’t notice. It is all a little… blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Have you noticed any other changes besides the fatigue?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… My appetite, maybe? It is not as good as it used to be. I don’t… crave things like I once did. And… sometimes my hands feel a little stiff in the morning. But I work with tools all day, so I thought that was just… from that. Is that a change? I don’t know what is normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I know of. Chills… not really. Weight loss? Maybe a little. But I am not sure. My clothes feel… looser, perhaps. But I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. My husband always used to worry about that, but… I don’t have a scale anymore. I suppose it is not important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any problems with your… bowel movements?
PATIENT: Problems? Oh… Well. They are… regular enough, I suppose. Not… different than usual. Sometimes a little… slow, perhaps. But nothing major. It’s not something I usually talk about. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? No. No changes there, either. It is… normal, I think. I have to get up at night sometimes, but that is just because I drink water before bed, you know? My husband always told me to drink plenty of water. Why are you asking about this? It feels… very personal.
DOCTOR: I'm simply gathering information, Ms. Benites. It's all part of a comprehensive assessment. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. Nothing that a doctor prescribed. I take… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, if it is bothering me. But it is not often. And sometimes a vitamin D, my neighbor suggested it. But I haven’t been taking it regularly. That is all. Nothing… serious. Just things I buy at the store.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I used to get hives as a child, but I haven’t had those in… decades. No trouble breathing, no swelling. Nothing like that. Just… normal things. Is this taking much longer?
DOCTOR: One final area. Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father had… diabetes, maybe? I don’t remember clearly. It was a long time ago. My husband’s side… I don’t know much about his family, to be honest. We didn’t talk about it much. Nothing major that I can think of. Mostly… old age. They all lived long lives, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Benites, given your symptoms, and based on my preliminary assessment, it sounds like you’re experiencing… age-related fatigue. It is not uncommon. We'll want to rule out other causes, of course. I’d like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a basic metabolic panel. And perhaps an EKG, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Oh. That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? I just thought I was… tired. Is it really necessary? I don't like needles. And an EKG… that is for hearts, isn't it? My mother… she had heart trouble.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Benites. It’s simply a precaution. We need to gather more information to rule out other possibilities. The blood work is standard, and the EKG is a quick, painless procedure. It will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Think of it as a routine check, just to ensure everything is functioning as it should. It’s better to be thorough, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Thorough, yes… I suppose you are right. It is just… a lot. My husband always took care of these things. I never had to worry about blood work and EKGs before. Alright. If you think it is necessary… yes, I will do it. But… can you explain everything to me afterwards? I don’t understand all the medical terms. And please… be gentle with the needle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. I will explain everything in detail. We have a phlebotomist here who is very skilled; she'll be gentle. We'll take things one step at a time. The nurse will draw the blood now, and I’ll schedule you for an EKG later this week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. And… the nurse? Is she very good? Perhaps you could tell her to… go slowly? I get nervous easily, you know. It is silly, I suppose. But… it is the needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, our nurse is excellent. Very experienced, very gentle. I will certainly let her know your concerns. She’s accustomed to patients feeling a bit anxious. She'll take good care of you. Let me call her now. Just relax, Ms. Benites. It will be over before you know it. I’ll be back shortly to discuss the results when they are available.
