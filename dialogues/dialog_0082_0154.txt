DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. I… well, it’s this… trouble I’ve been having. With my… waterworks, you could say. It keeps coming back, this feeling. Not a good feeling, at all. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been… a while. Is that enough information? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's alright, Claudene. Take your time. "Trouble with your waterworks"... could you tell me a bit more about that feeling?
PATIENT: It’s… a burning. Down there, you see. And a need to… go. Often. Even when I haven’t had much to drink. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’ve been trying to drink more water, like my daughter suggested, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I’m sorry, I don’t… remember if I explained that clearly. It's just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining perfectly fine, Claudene. A burning sensation and frequent urination, even with good fluid intake… alright. And is this happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. It’ll be alright for a bit, maybe a day or two, and then… it starts again. It feels worse sometimes, you see. Like a real ache. But mostly just… annoying. And I have to… well, go to the little girls’ room often. Especially at night. It wakes me up, you see. It’s very disruptive. I… don’t remember if this is helpful information. I do try to remember things, but… it doesn’t always work.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Claudene, don't you worry. Frequent urination, particularly at night, with periods of feeling better and worse… We're building a picture here. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. I… I don't think so. I haven’t really… looked. I try not to think about it too much. Pain in my back… sometimes. But I have an old back. Always have. I thought that was just my age, you see. It aches a bit when I bend over, but… that's normal for me. It's not a sharp pain, if that makes sense. Just a dull ache. I… I hope I'm not being too confusing. I really don’t remember things well.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Claudene. You’re doing just fine. Dull ache in your back, which you attribute to age… alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a tricky question. I’ve been to doctors before, of course. But I don’t recall… what they said, exactly. I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, I think. And… I had something with my stomach, once. But I don’t remember the name. I used to have a doctor back in… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. I… I really don’t have a good memory for things like that. Is it important? Perhaps my daughter has the records? She's very organized.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Claudene, but if you don’t recall, that’s alright. Your daughter having the records would be very useful. We can certainly try to get those if you’d like. For now, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, or any over-the-counter medications or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not really. I used to take something for my… waterworks, a long time ago. But I stopped. It didn't seem to help much, and I didn't like the way it made me feel. Now, I just try to drink plenty of water, like I said. And maybe a little chamomile tea before bed, if I'm feeling restless. But that's it. No pills, no anything. I try to stay away from those things, if I can. I… I don't want to bother you with too much detail. I really am not good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Claudene. It's helpful to know you're not currently taking any medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy, when I was a child, but that doesn’t count, does it? And I don’t eat shellfish. Not because I’m allergic, just because I don’t like it. But… no real allergies, no. I… I really wish I could be more helpful. I feel like I’m just rambling. Is this taking up too much of your time?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Claudene. You're doing perfectly fine. No known allergies, and no shellfish… alright. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Surgeries… Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That’s all I remember. And… I think I had a… something on my knee, once. A small thing. But I don’t recall exactly what it was. It was a long time ago. And I was very young. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… terrible. I… I apologize for not being more helpful. I really am trying. Perhaps my daughter knows more about all this. She's very good with dates and details.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Claudene. It's alright. Tonsillectomy, and something on the knee… alright. Now, finally, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother lived to be a very old age, I believe. But I don't recall any specific… illnesses. My father… he passed away when I was young. I don’t recall… any family members having trouble with their… waterworks, if that’s what you mean. No, I don’t believe so. Honestly, Doctor, my family history is a bit of a blur. I… I really wish I could be more helpful. I feel like I'm just wasting your time. Is it alright if we just… stop? I'm just getting confused.
DOCTOR: No, you're not wasting my time at all, Claudene. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember everything. We’ve gathered quite a bit of information already. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a burning sensation and frequent urination, with periods of improvement and worsening. Given your age and symptoms, and without a clear family history, it's important to rule out a few possibilities. Would you be comfortable if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… I… I don't know. What does that involve, exactly? I’m not very good with… examinations. I get a bit… nervous. And I don’t want to be a bother. If it’s going to take too long, or be too… invasive, then perhaps we should just stop. I… I really don’t want to cause any trouble. I think my daughter would know what to do. Perhaps I should just call her?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Claudene. We can certainly stop, or call your daughter. However, a quick physical exam would just involve checking your abdomen and possibly a simple urine test. It's nothing invasive, and it would help me determine if further testing is needed. We can also discuss your concerns and any anxieties you might have beforehand. The exam itself would be relatively quick, and I'll explain everything as I go. It would help me rule out some common causes of your symptoms, such as a urinary tract infection. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine test, you say? That doesn’t sound too bad. But the… checking your abdomen… I don't know. I'm a bit… sensitive there. And I get nervous easily, like I said. If it’s going to be uncomfortable, or if it’s going to take a long time, then… perhaps not. I really don't want to cause any trouble. Maybe… maybe just the urine test? But I’d like to know exactly what it involves first. And how long it will take. And… if it will hurt.
DOCTOR: Of course, Claudene. Absolutely. We can definitely just start with the urine test. It's a very simple procedure. You'll simply be asked to provide a small sample of your urine in a cup. It doesn't hurt at all, and it takes just a few minutes. As for the abdominal exam, we can skip that for now. If the urine test shows anything concerning, we can discuss whether or not to proceed with a more thorough examination at that time. Does that sound more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… much more comfortable. Just the urine test, then. And… no checking my abdomen. That’s alright. If it's just a simple sample, then I can do that. Where do I go? And… what do I do? I’m a bit… flustered, now. I apologize for being so… difficult. I really don’t like doctors. It just makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Claudene. It's perfectly alright to be nervous. Many people feel that way. Here is a cup, and a bag. I’ll have you go to the restroom just down the hall, and collect a sample in this cup. Just try to relax, and collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a bit in the cup, and finish. It doesn't need to be a lot, just a few ounces. When you're finished, just bring the cup back to me, and I'll send it to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Yes. I think I can do that. Mid-stream… you said. Start and stop. I remember that. Just a few ounces. Alright. Down the hall, you said? And… then bring it back to you? Is there anything else I need to know? And… how long will it take? I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Down the hall, first door on the left. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, Claudene. I'll be right here when you get back. I'll just make a note of the time, and we can discuss the next steps after the lab results come in. Don’t rush, and if you have any trouble, just let one of the nurses know. Here’s a small lid for the cup, to avoid any spills. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope it doesn’t take too long.
