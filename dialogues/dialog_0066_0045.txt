DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's my face. It gets… red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes, and it feels warm. Not always, but enough to bother me. I don't know why it does that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re experiencing flushing – redness and warmth in your face – that comes and goes. That is bothersome. How long has this been going on, Enrique?
PATIENT: Hmm… a good while now. Maybe… six months? Hard to say exactly. It started slow, just a little color after… after my wife passed. It’s been more frequent lately, though. Not every day, but maybe three or four times a week. Sometimes more when I… think about things.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Enrique. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult, and it can absolutely manifest in physical ways. So, it sounds like this flushing started around the time of your loss and has been increasing in frequency, particularly when you're thinking about things… Can you describe what you’re thinking about when it happens?
PATIENT: It’s mostly… memories. Good ones, usually. Like… her cooking. Or when we went to the beach. Sometimes just… her laugh. It's funny, right? Happy thoughts making me red. But then… sometimes it's sad thoughts too. Remembering… the hospital. It’s a mix. And I don’t know why it makes my face hot. It doesn't hurt, just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It’s not funny at all, Enrique, and you're not alone in experiencing physical symptoms with grief. It sounds like these flushing episodes are connected to both happy and sad memories, which is very telling. And embarrassment is a perfectly valid feeling. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about how the flushing feels besides warm?
PATIENT: Hmm… besides warm. Okay. It's like… a wave. It starts on my cheeks, then spreads to my neck. Sometimes my ears feel hot too. It doesn't itch, and it's not bumpy. Just… red. And it feels… tight, a little. Like my skin is stretched. Not painful, but… noticeable. People look. And it goes away after a few minutes, usually. Sometimes longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a wave of redness starting on the cheeks and spreading to the neck and ears, with a feeling of tightness – not itchy or bumpy. And it lasts for a few minutes, sometimes longer. That gives me a good starting point. Now, let's talk about other things that might be going on. Do you notice if anything else triggers these episodes besides thinking about memories?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Not really… not that I’ve noticed. I drink tea, sometimes. Black tea. But I’ve been drinking that for years, and it never bothered me before. I eat normal food. I don't… drink alcohol. Not anymore. And I don't smoke. I walk a little, but not much. I mostly just… stay home. I guess not much changes my routine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers besides the memories, and a fairly consistent routine. Good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a full picture. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I sleep okay, I think. Maybe I wake up a little in the night sometimes, but nothing bad. My stomach is alright. I haven't been sick. I… I don't know. What are you thinking about?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Enrique. I'm just trying to rule out anything else that might be contributing to this. I'm thinking about things like sweating, dizziness, headaches, palpitations – anything that might come along with these flushing episodes. Have you noticed any of those things happening at the same time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of that. No sweating, no dizziness, no headaches. My heart feels… normal. It doesn’t race or anything. Just the red face. That's all. It's just… the face. And it’s embarrassing. People stare. Especially at the store.
DOCTOR: Okay, Enrique, thank you for being so thorough. It sounds like this really is primarily focused on the facial flushing, with no other accompanying symptoms. Now, let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said it was okay now. He gave me some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them years ago. He said I was fine. Other than that… nothing. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time. Just… the blood pressure, a long time ago. And I don’t take any pills now.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure that’s currently managed without medication. And no other known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital, except… when my wife was sick. But that wasn't me. That was her. Other than that, no. Always been healthy. Well, mostly. Until this. The red face. It's just… new. And bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous surgeries or hospitalizations, other than your wife's illness. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of any medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, skin problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart, when he was old. But other than that… not much. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. We don't see each other much. And… my wife’s family? I don't really know. We didn't talk about that much. So, probably high blood pressure and heart problems, on my side. Maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure and heart problems on your side of the family. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had allergies. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a reaction to any pills. Never had any problems with that. I… I think I’m pretty simple. Not much bothers me, usually. Except the red face. And missing my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. No pills, no vitamins, no supplements. I don't take anything. Just… tea. Black tea. But like I said, I’ve been drinking that for years. And it never bothered me before. Is that all the questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all the questions, Enrique. Thank you for being so thorough. Based on what you've told me – the facial flushing triggered by memories, no other associated symptoms, history of managed high blood pressure, family history of heart disease and hypertension, and no medications or allergies – it sounds like we're dealing with something called rosacea. It's possible, and sometimes the emotional stress of grief can trigger or worsen rosacea symptoms. However, it’s also important to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to take a closer look at your skin and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Rosacea? Is that… serious? I've never heard of that. And the stress… yes, maybe. Losing my wife… it was hard. A physical exam? Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. If you want to check my blood pressure, that’s okay too. I haven't had that checked in a long time. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. Not drastically high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I see some redness on your cheeks and nose, and a few small visible blood vessels. Your skin feels a little rough to the touch. It does seem consistent with rosacea. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. These will help us check for underlying inflammation or other conditions. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? That sounds… okay. If you think it’s important, yes. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it something I need pills for? I don’t really want to take more pills, if I can help it. But if you think it will help… yes. Blood tests are fine. How much will they cost? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Enrique. We can definitely discuss the costs upfront. The basic panel I’m thinking of – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – typically costs around $150-$200 at the lab we use. We also have options for a payment plan, if that would be helpful. As for whether you'll need pills, it's too early to say. Many cases of rosacea can be managed with topical creams and lifestyle changes. We'll see what the blood tests show, and then we can discuss the best treatment options for you. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood tests for you?
PATIENT: $150 to $200… That’s… a bit much. But if it will help me figure out what’s wrong… okay. Yes. Order the tests. I guess I can try to find the money. And no pills, if possible. I don’t like taking too many things. Lifestyle changes… that sounds good. What kind of changes? Less tea?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’ll go ahead and order the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll give you instructions on how to prepare. They'll also be able to discuss payment options with you directly. As for lifestyle changes, there are a few things that can often help manage rosacea. Avoiding triggers like sun exposure, wind, and spicy foods can make a big difference. Limiting alcohol and caffeine intake can also be beneficial. And yes, sometimes reducing caffeine intake can help, although black tea itself isn't always a major trigger for everyone. More importantly, managing stress is key. Have you considered talking to a therapist or joining a support group?
PATIENT: A therapist? Hmm. I haven’t thought about that. It's just… hard to talk about. About my wife. About everything. But… maybe. Maybe it would help. I think I’ll just get the blood tests first. See what those say. Then… then I’ll think about the therapist. Is there one you recommend? Near here?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good plan, Enrique. Let's focus on the blood tests for now. I do have a list of therapists in the area. Here you go. I’ve highlighted a few that specialize in grief counseling, as that might be particularly helpful. They all take new patients, and you can contact them directly to schedule a consultation. Okay, so you have the list of therapists, and you’ll get the blood tests done. Once the results are back – which usually takes 2-3 business days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Two or three days… I can wait. Thank you for the list. I’ll look at them later. And thank you for listening. It helps just to talk about it, a little. I think that’s all for now, right? Just the blood tests and the follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for now, Enrique. Just the blood tests, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I'm glad you feel comfortable talking about it. Remember, grief is a process, and it's okay to seek support. Here's the lab requisition form. Take this to the lab down the hall, and they'll take care of everything. If you have any questions before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, Enrique. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Condray. I will. I think I’ll go get those tests done now. .
