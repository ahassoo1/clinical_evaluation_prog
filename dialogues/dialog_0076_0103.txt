DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Vankampen, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Albino Vankampen. But please, call me Al. It’s…easier. I been havin’ trouble with my back, doctor. For a while now. It’s not good.
DOCTOR: "Al," alright. And how long is "a while now," exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…maybe six months ago? At first it was just a little ache, you know? Like after I’d been liftin’ boxes for the church fundraiser. I do a lot of that, still. But it hasn’t gone away. It’s gotten…worse lately. Especially when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Six months…lifting boxes…right. And is this pain…constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It comes and goes. Mostly when I move. Or if I stand for too long. When I’m sittin’ still, it’s…better, but there’s always somethin’ there, a dull ache. Like an old friend, but not a good friend. You understand? It's in my lower back, right at the small of my back.
DOCTOR: Small of the back…yes, yes. Any radiation?
PATIENT: Radiation? What do you mean? Like…like from the TV? No, I don’t think so. It doesn’t feel like anything is shootin’ down my legs or anything. It just…hurts there. In my back. Is that…what you mean? I don’t understand all these big words, doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Radiation. As in, does the pain travel down your legs?
PATIENT: Oh! Down my legs… No, no it doesn’t. It stays right in my back. Sometimes it feels… tight, like a muscle. And sometimes it’s just… sharp. Not all the time, mind you. Mostly when I try to… well, bend. Or twist. I try not to do much twistin’ these days. It makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. And my legs feel… okay. I can walk, I can stand. It’s just… it’s hard to keep standin’. And bendin’ is… not a pleasure, let me tell you. Sometimes I feel a little shaky, but I think that’s just my age. I’m seventy-seven, doctor. Things start to fall apart, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And… I think I’ve actually gained a little weight, if I’m honest. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to watch what I eat. She worries too much, that one. No, no weight loss. Just… back pain. And getting old. It's probably just that, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any problems with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? No, no problems there. Everything works… as it should. Thankfully. I’m a simple man, doctor. I just want my back to stop hurtin’ so I can lift those boxes for the church. It’s important work, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you tried any treatments for this pain?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. My daughter, she’s a nurse, she gave me some… pills. Ibuprofen, I think it was. It helped a little, for a few hours, but then the pain came back. And I tried heat, you know? A warm bath, a heating pad. That feels nice for a bit, but it doesn’t really fix anything. I don’t like takin’ pills, if I can avoid it. They make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have you lie down on the exam table. I'll take a quick look.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. Exam table, you say? Right this way, I suppose. Hope I’m not too much trouble. This old body doesn’t move like it used to.
DOCTOR: Lie face down, please. I need to check your range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay, face down. Right. A little uncomfortable, but… alright. Range of motion, you said? Just tell me what to do, doctor. I’ll try my best. This is… not my favorite thing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. Right in the middle. It’s… it’s hard to say exactly. It sort of aches all over, but this is the worst of it. And when I bend… Oof. Right there. Definitely right there. It feels… tight and sore.
DOCTOR: Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes! Ooh, yes, right there. That’s… that’s a little sore. A little more than a little, actually. It feels… like a bruise, almost. But I don't remember hitting my back. Is that… bad? It's been hurting a lot lately, so maybe I just didn’t notice?
DOCTOR: Alright. Straighten your right leg. Now, can you lift it up?
PATIENT: Okay, straighten my right leg… Like this? And lift it up… It’s… a little difficult, doctor. It doesn’t go up very high. I feel a little pull in my back when I do that. And… it's a bit painful. I haven’t been doing much exercise lately, if that matters. It’s just… hard when everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about the left leg?
PATIENT: Okay, left leg… This one feels a little better. I can lift it a bit higher… Still a little pull in my back, but not as bad as the right. It’s just… tiring, you know? I haven't been using my legs much either, with the back pain. Is something wrong, doctor?
DOCTOR: It appears you have some muscle strain. Likely aggravated by lifting. You’re getting older, Mr. Vankampen. These things happen. I’m prescribing you some stronger ibuprofen and recommending physical therapy. If it doesn't improve in a few weeks, then we'll talk about imaging. Here. And the physical therapy place is down the street. I’ll give you the number. Now, do you have any other complaints?
PATIENT: Oh… muscle strain. That’s… not so bad, then? Physical therapy… alright, I can try that. I want to be able to lift those boxes again, you see. For the church. No, no other complaints, doctor. Just my back. But thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate your help. I hope the ibuprofen works. And I will call about the physical therapy. .
