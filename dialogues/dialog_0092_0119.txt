DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's...rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s why one comes to the doctor, isn't it? It’s my… companion. He has a… discharge. A most unpleasant one, I assure you. It’s terribly unhygienic.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things, and you’re right to address it. It's good you're taking care of this. To be clear, when you say "companion," are we referring to a pet?
PATIENT: A pet? Heavens, no! Doctor, are you quite alright? I mean… a gentleman friend. A… close companion. Though, at the moment, he’s not being very companionable with this… affliction. Honestly, the state of his… personal hygiene is quite concerning. I've been trying to encourage better practices, but… well. It’s proving difficult.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Wartick. That was a very foolish assumption on my part. I assure you, I am quite alright, just… momentarily distracted. It's important to me that you feel comfortable discussing anything with me. So, to clarify, this discharge is from your… gentleman friend?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. From him. It's simply dreadful. And frankly, it’s causing a bit of a… disruption. He’s usually so meticulous, but lately… it’s quite distressing. It’s a yellowish color, I believe. And it… smells. It's not a pleasant aroma, I can assure you. I've been advising him to… clean more frequently, but he insists it's simply a… temporary issue. Honestly, men! They never listen.
DOCTOR: I understand. A yellowish discharge and an unpleasant odor… that certainly warrants investigation. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me approximately how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it's been… well, it began shortly after that trip to Atlantic City. Perhaps a week or so after? Yes, I’d say approximately two weeks now. He seemed perfectly fine in Atlantic City, but shortly after returning… this began. It's been progressively worsening, I’m afraid. And quite inconvenient, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Two weeks, starting after the trip to Atlantic City… Alright. And has he experienced any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, he has been a bit more… irritable lately. And rather tired. He naps more frequently, which is unusual for him. And he complains of a slight… burning sensation. Though, he attributes that to indigestion. Men, you know? They self-diagnose everything. He refuses to see a doctor himself, naturally. That’s why I’m here. It’s simply appalling.
DOCTOR: I understand. Irritability, fatigue, and a burning sensation… even if he attributes it to indigestion, it’s good you’re noting these things. Has he had any fever, chills, or pain in his lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, no fever, Doctor. Definitely not. And no chills, either. He complained of a slight ache in his lower back a couple of days ago, but he blamed it on helping me with the gardening. He insists he’s perfectly fine, just a little… tired. Honestly, men are so stubborn. He simply refuses to acknowledge anything is amiss. It's terribly frustrating. I’ve tried to be supportive, but I’m beginning to worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It’s good you’re being attentive to these things, even if he’s reluctant to acknowledge them. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about his medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if he has any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, he does have a rather… robust appetite, if that counts. And he enjoys his… spirits, shall we say? But as for actual medical conditions… I honestly couldn’t say. He doesn’t discuss those sorts of things. He used to visit a doctor in Philadelphia, years ago, but I don’t know what, if anything, he was treated for. He’s very private, you see. And rather proud. He’d never admit to being unwell. It’s… frustrating, to say the least. He's a very independent man, you understand. And quite… headstrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult when someone is reluctant to share information. Do you know if he’s had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, he did have a rather nasty fall a few years back. He was climbing a ladder, attempting to repair the gutters, and… well, it was quite a tumble. He broke his wrist, I believe. He was hospitalized for a few days, but he recovered remarkably quickly. He’s a strong man, you see. Very resilient. He was quite embarrassed by it, though. Insisted it was a simple accident, nothing to worry about. He doesn’t like being seen as… vulnerable. It’s a flaw, I suppose. But he recovered completely, I assure you. He was back to his usual self within weeks.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful to know. And do you know if he has any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. He enjoys a wide variety of foods, and I’ve never seen him react badly to anything. He does occasionally complain of a slight… stuffy nose during pollen season, but he attributes that to the flowers in the garden. He's quite proud of his roses, you see. He takes a great deal of care with them. He doesn’t take any regular medication, as far as I know. He believes in a healthy lifestyle, mostly. Although, he does enjoy his… evening brandy. But no known allergies, Doctor. I’m quite certain of that. He’s a very robust man, you understand. A healthy appetite and a strong constitution. Although, the discharge is rather concerning, of course. It's quite… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, Ms. Wartick, I'd like to ask about your own medical history, if that's alright. Do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, well, my health is perfectly sound, thank you very much. I take excellent care of myself. I've always been very particular about my diet and exercise. I do have a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it's nothing debilitating. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. And I’m on Medicare, of course. But other than that, I’m perfectly healthy. I’ve always been a very strong woman. It’s just… this situation with him is rather distressing. It’s affecting my sleep, you see. Worrying about him. But my health is perfectly fine. Thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Wartick. I understand your concern for him is what’s bringing you in today. Now, to get a better understanding of his current condition, would you be comfortable if I were to perform a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: A… physical examination? Doctor, are you suggesting you examine him? I don’t know… I hadn’t anticipated this. He would be… most displeased. He’s a very private man, you see. And rather sensitive. I’m not sure he’d approve. I brought him here vicariously, through my concern. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t you simply prescribe something based on my description? It's a rather delicate matter, you understand. A gentleman doesn’t often discuss… these things.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Ms. Wartick, and I would never want to do anything that would make either of you uncomfortable. However, to provide the best possible care and determine the cause of his symptoms, a physical examination is really the most responsible course of action. It will allow me to assess the situation directly and rule out any serious underlying conditions. I understand his privacy is important, and I assure you I will conduct the examination with the utmost discretion and professionalism. We can discuss exactly what will be involved beforehand, and you are welcome to be present during the examination if he agrees. If he’s truly unwilling, we can discuss alternative options, but it may limit our ability to accurately diagnose and treat the issue. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is most difficult. He’s a very stubborn man, you see. And easily embarrassed. I suppose… if you assure me it will be conducted with the utmost discretion… and that you won’t ask him to do anything… uncomfortable… I could try to persuade him. But I make no promises. He’s quite adamant about his privacy. And he’s prone to… exaggeration. He might claim it's nothing, even if it’s quite obvious. Honestly, men! They never listen to reason. Very well, Doctor. I will attempt to convince him. But if he refuses… I don’t know what I’ll do. It’s a most delicate situation. A gentleman’s… sensitivities, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Wartick. I will proceed with the utmost sensitivity and respect. And I assure you, I will only ask what is absolutely necessary to determine the cause of his symptoms. Please take your time, and if he's willing, we can proceed at his pace. In the meantime, while you speak with him, I’ll prepare the examination room. Perhaps while I do that, you could tell me a little bit more about his… lifestyle. Does he engage in any risky behaviors, or have any recent travel history?
PATIENT: Risky… behaviors? Doctor, I hardly think that’s relevant! He’s a gentleman! A respected member of the community! Honestly, the questions you’re asking… it's quite inappropriate. He’s a man of… refined habits. He enjoys gardening, reading, and the occasional brandy. As for travel… we visited Atlantic City, as I mentioned. But that was a simple vacation! A weekend getaway! No… risky behaviors, Doctor. I assure you. He's a very… respectable man. And I find your line of questioning quite… impertinent. Really. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to speak with him. This is becoming most uncomfortable. .
