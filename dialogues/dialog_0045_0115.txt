DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Durig. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Thank you, Doctor… Billman, is it? It’s… well, it's my skin. It’s gotten quite yellow. A friend mentioned something about… the liver? I honestly don't recall all the details. It’s been a bit of a worry, and I thought it best to have someone look at it. I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Yellow skin, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… oh dear, when did it start? A few weeks ago, I believe. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… noticeable. And I do feel a bit tired lately, but at my age, one always feels a little tired, doesn’t one? Is it something I should be very concerned about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And just the yellowing of the skin and fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. And… sometimes a bit of an upset stomach, but I eat rather irregularly, so that could be anything. My appetite hasn’t been very good either, come to think of it. I do try to eat, but… well, it's difficult sometimes. I mostly just want to rest. Is this… is this related to my liver, Doctor? I believe a friend mentioned Hepatitis… but I could be mistaken. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis is one possibility, yes. It's good you mentioned that. We'll need to do some bloodwork, of course, to rule things in or out. Irregular appetite and stomach upset… those could be related. Now, have you noticed any dark urine, or pale stools?
PATIENT: Oh, bloodwork… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Dark urine… let me see… I haven’t really noticed, if that makes sense. I don’t pay close attention to such things, I’m afraid. Pale stools… no, I don’t believe so. Everything seems… normal in that regard. I’m terribly sorry I can’t be more helpful. It all feels rather… hazy, you see. Do you need me to try and remember anything specific? Perhaps a date when I first noticed the yellowing? It’s just so difficult…
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed with some tests, then. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? Oh… no, not recently. Not for… well, goodness, it must be years. Not since… well, I can't quite recall where or when. Just little trips to the shops, that’s all. Nothing exciting. I haven’t been on a proper holiday in decades. I mostly stay at home, you see. Is travel relevant, Doctor? I apologize if I’m being a bother. Perhaps this is just old age catching up with me?
DOCTOR: It can be relevant. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's... a difficult question. I've seen so many doctors over the years. Let me think... I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And… I believe I had high blood pressure at one point, but it was treated, I think. Honestly, I have so many files at home, it’s a mess. I can't recall the specifics. Nothing major, I don’t believe. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you see. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps if you told me a condition, I could tell you if I've had it? It’s easier that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of liver problems, or jaundice?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a good question. My mother… she was a strong woman, but she wasn’t one for talking about ailments. I don’t recall her ever being ill, truthfully. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, I’m afraid. I don’t know much about his medical history. I had a sister, but she moved to America many years ago and we haven’t spoken in decades. I'm afraid I’m not much help on that front, Doctor. Honestly, my family wasn’t very forthcoming with such details. I apologize. Is that… problematic?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a better feel for things. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam. Very well. Just let me… I hope I’m not too much trouble, Doctor. It’s just… getting older isn’t easy, you see. Is there anything specific you'll be looking for?
DOCTOR: Just lie down on your back, Mrs. Durig. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and feel around a bit. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but let me know if it is. Okay, take a few deep breaths for me… Good. I'm not hearing anything concerning at this moment, but we’ll need to feel for your liver and spleen size. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, alright. Here? No, that’s… alright. Not particularly painful, just… aware of your touch, you see. It feels a bit… empty, if that makes sense. Is that… normal? I hope I’m not being a bother. I just don’t like being poked and prodded, you see. It reminds me of… never mind. Continue, Doctor, whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A little bit of resistance here… Not drastically enlarged, but I do feel something. Now, I'm going to check for any fluid build-up. And how about here, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: Here? No… it’s… not comfortable. A bit of pressure, you see. It feels… full, perhaps? Is that what you’re looking for, Doctor? I'm terribly sorry, I'm not very good at describing these things. I just know it doesn't feel quite right. Like… a heavy feeling. Perhaps I should just lie still? I don't want to be a bother. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Durig. We'll need to run some bloodwork to get a better picture of what's going on. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a liver panel, and a bilirubin level. We'll also check your kidney function. This will help us rule out various possibilities, including liver inflammation, gallbladder issues, and other potential problems. It's best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, bloodwork. Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Liver inflammation… Is that serious, Doctor? I do hope it’s nothing too drastic. I just want to feel myself again. When will I know the results? And what happens if… if it is something serious? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just… I’m a bit anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be anxious, Mrs. Durig. We'll take things one step at a time. Liver inflammation can be serious, but it’s also often treatable, depending on the cause. The bloodwork will give us a clearer picture. The lab should have the results back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you as soon as they’re available. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, try to get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. And if you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or changes in your stool color – please contact us immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring. Rest and fluids, yes. I can manage that. No, I don't think so. Just… the waiting. That's always the hardest part, isn't it? Thank you for your time, Doctor Billman. And please, thank Sarah for me. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose I’ll be going now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Durig. You’re very welcome. Sarah is excellent, she’ll take good care of you. Let’s get you checked out, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Just take your time, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
