DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. It’s my stomach. Just… constant diarrhea. Nothing’s stopping it. I’ve tried everything, and I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Constant diarrhea is certainly disruptive. The nurse did mention this briefly, but I like to hear it directly from you so we can get a good understanding of what's going on. When did this start, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really keep track of dates. Maybe… a week ago? Something like that. It just… started. And it hasn’t let up. I’ve been dealing with it, but now it’s interfering with work, and I need to get back to painting.
DOCTOR: I see. So, roughly a week ago. And it’s impacting your ability to work and your painting – that’s important to know. When you say it "just started," was there anything specific happening around the time it began?
PATIENT: Look, I eat normal food. I don't go around licking doorknobs. What do you want me to say? I was… working. Like I always am. It just… happened. I don't need a history lesson on how to remember what I ate a week ago. It's diarrhea, not a mystery novel.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I’m not trying to make this a complicated investigation. It’s just that sometimes pinpointing when something started and what was happening at the time can give us a clue. But if you don’t recall anything specific, that’s okay. Let’s talk about the diarrhea itself. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: It's… diarrhea. What more description do you need? It’s loose. It’s… frequent. It smells bad, obviously. I don't need to go into graphic detail, Doctor. It’s unpleasant. Really unpleasant. And it’s not going away. I’ve taken… those over-the-counter things. The pink ones. And the white ones. Nothing works.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent and loose stools, and unpleasant odor – I appreciate you describing that, even though it’s uncomfortable to talk about. You've tried some over-the-counter medications – bismuth subsalicylate and loperamide , correct?
PATIENT: Yes, those are the ones. Look, I'm not a pharmacist. I bought them at the store. Do I need to read the labels to you? I just know they didn’t do anything. I'm wasting my time here. Can’t you just give me something that will stop it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. It’s certainly discouraging when over-the-counter medications don’t provide relief. And I appreciate your patience with me as I ask these questions – it helps me to understand the full picture. Before we discuss medications, I'd like to ask about a few other things, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Seriously? No! Do I look like I'm dying? If there was blood, I'd probably be at the hospital, not sitting here explaining my bathroom habits to you. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Ms. Woodring. It's important to rule out any serious causes. You're right; if you were seeing blood, you likely would be at the hospital. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: A little cramping, maybe. Nothing major. I've had worse from lifting heavy buckets on a job site. No fever, no throwing up. Just… this. Endless, awful diarrhea. And it’s making me tired. I just want to be done with it. Can we please just skip to the part where you give me something to fix it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild cramping, no fever or vomiting, and you’re feeling tired. That’s helpful. Just a couple more quick questions, and then we can talk about treatment options. Have you traveled anywhere recently – even within the state – or been exposed to anyone who has been sick recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I haven’t left town in months. I work. Constantly. And no, I haven’t been around anyone sick. I keep to myself. This is getting absurd. I'm a painter, not an adventurer. Just give me something strong, please. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration and your need to return to work. Let's move on to a physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But hurry. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. Your abdomen is soft, but there's a little tenderness in the lower abdomen when I press deeply. No significant guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your bowel sounds are present, though a bit hyperactive. Now, can you tell me about any medications you currently take, including any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen when my back hurts from hauling equipment. That’s it. I’m not one for pills. I prefer to just get on with things. Honestly, I don't understand why you need to know every little detail. It’s diarrhea, not a complicated illness.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Good to know. And lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I don’t go around sniffing flowers, either. Look, can we finally talk about getting me something to stop this? I'm starting to feel like I’m wasting my entire day here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Based on what you’ve told me—the week-long history of diarrhea, no fever or blood, mild abdominal cramping, and the fact that over-the-counter medications haven’t helped—it sounds like you likely have acute gastroenteritis, possibly viral. It's very common, and often resolves on its own. However, since it’s been a week and you’re still experiencing significant symptoms, I want to be cautious. I'm going to order a stool sample to rule out any bacterial or parasitic infections. This will help us determine the best course of treatment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A stool sample?! Are you serious? You want me to… take a sample? That’s disgusting! And it’s going to take even longer to get results? I told you, I just need something to stop it. This is ridiculous. I’m not doing a stool sample. Just give me something strong, and I'll be on my way. I have work to do. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for the unpleasantness of it. However, without knowing the cause of your diarrhea, prescribing medication could potentially worsen the situation or mask a more serious underlying issue. It's important to rule out other possibilities. Since you're declining the stool sample, I strongly recommend you consult with a gastroenterologist. They can perform further testing and provide more specialized care. I can give you a referral. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on hydration with clear fluids like water and electrolyte solutions, and a bland diet—think bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Avoid dairy, fatty foods, and caffeine. I will write you a prescription for loperamide to help control the symptoms. However, please use it cautiously and follow the instructions carefully. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or see blood in your stool, seek immediate medical attention. Here’s the referral information for Dr. Ramirez, a gastroenterologist in town. Would you like me to print that out for you?
