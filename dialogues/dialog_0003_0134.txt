DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, mostly. I just don't feel right. Everything seems to make me feel full so fast now, and I've been feeling sick to my stomach a lot. It's been going on for a little while, I reckon. Not sure how long exactly... time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: "A little while," you say. Right. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It… started maybe around springtime? Or was it summer? I’ve been helping my granddaughter with her horses, you see, and that’s been keeping me busy. I think it was before the county fair, definitely. Everything is a bit… fuzzy. I apologize. It’s just… hard to pinpoint. I feel like I haven’t been keeping track of things as well lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We need some timeframe to work with, Ms. Kelder. Before the county fair… that's still quite a bit of time. And you mentioned feeling full quickly and nausea. Is the nausea constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Some days are better than others. It's not all day long, thankfully. But when it does come, it's… unpleasant. It just feels like I can't keep anything down, even a little bit of toast. And even before that, I just don’t have much of an appetite. Everything just feels… heavy. I hope that makes sense. I'm not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific triggered these episodes of nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I eat pretty simple things, usually. Soup, toast, sometimes a little bit of chicken if my granddaughter cooks it. It doesn’t seem to be a certain food, or anything like that. It just… happens. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes even if I haven’t. That’s the strange part, I think. It's just… random. I've been trying to eat smaller portions, but it doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: So, no dietary changes, no obvious triggers… Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. I’ve been feeling… tired. More tired than usual, I mean. And a little weak, I suppose. It’s hard to say if that’s from not eating much, or something else. And… sometimes I get a bit of a headache, but those come and go too. Nothing too bad, just a dull ache. I don't know if any of that's related, though. It's probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh my. Doctor, I… well, that's a bit personal, isn't it? Let me see... It's been… a little irregular. Not as regular as it used to be, I suppose. Sometimes I feel… stopped up, and sometimes… well, the opposite. It’s been bothering me, but I didn’t want to bother you with it. It seemed like a small thing compared to the nausea.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical exam, Ms. Kelder. We’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll palpate it to check for any tenderness or masses. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. That sounds… sensible. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know. And… I apologize if I’m not being very helpful. I'm just a bit… muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright. I don’t detect any significant tenderness, and I don’t feel any obvious masses. Your bowel sounds are… somewhat diminished. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I hadn’t really thought about it. My granddaughter says I’m looking a bit thinner, but I just figured it was the summer heat. I haven’t been eating much, like I said, so I suppose it’s possible. I don't weigh myself regularly, so I don't know for sure. It's probably not much, though. Just a little bit, I reckon. I've always been a small person. But you know, thinking about it… my clothes are a bit looser than they used to be. Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – nausea, decreased appetite, unintentional weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and fatigue – I’m going to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also need a stool sample to rule out any infection. I also recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist.
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like… a lot of tests. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I’m not very good with medical things, and all these terms… it’s all a bit overwhelming. I just thought it was maybe a little bit of indigestion, or something. A gastroenterologist… is that someone who specializes in stomachs? I hope it’s not too bad. Will these tests be… painful?
DOCTOR: The tests are standard procedures, Ms. Kelder. The blood work is a simple blood draw. The stool sample… well, you’ll collect it at home. As for the gastroenterologist, yes, they specialize in the digestive system. I’m ordering these tests to rule out anything serious. It could be something simple, like a mild infection or a dietary issue. But given your symptoms, it’s best to be thorough. We need to investigate further. It is… prudent. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and the referral form for the gastroenterologist. The lab is just down the hall. Please schedule an appointment with the gastroenterologist as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Down the hall for the blood work, and then make an appointment with… a gastro… what did you call it? A gastroenterologist. Right. It’s just… all this seems like a lot. And the thought of more tests… I just hope it's nothing too serious. But you’re right, it’s best to be safe. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll go do the blood work now, I suppose. Is there anything else I should know? Or… any questions you have for me? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Kelder. Just follow the instructions on the forms. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, schedule the appointment with the gastroenterologist as soon as possible. We'll discuss the results when they are available. That will be all for today.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I'll… I'll see what I can do about the tests. And the appointment. Thank you again.
