DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s rather troubling, to be honest. It’s not like I’ve changed anything in my diet or exercise routine.
DOCTOR: I see. Weight gain, despite no alterations to your usual habits. That is concerning. To get a clearer picture, could you describe how much weight you’ve gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… approximately six months, I would say. And… well, I weigh about ten pounds more than I did then. Perhaps a little more, actually. It’s difficult to be precise, but ten pounds is a good estimate. I… I do keep track, you see. It’s just… unexpected.
DOCTOR: Ten pounds over six months…while not drastic, it warrants investigation, certainly. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me consider. No, not really. I’ve been sleeping alright, perhaps a little more tired than usual, but nothing significant. My appetite is the same, and… no swelling anywhere, if that’s what you mean. I’ve been feeling generally well, all things considered. It’s just… the weight. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Generally well,” you say. And yet, experiencing unexplained weight gain. Do you have any difficulty breathing, or notice any palpitations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no difficulty breathing at all. And no palpitations. My heart feels… normal. I mean, I can feel it, of course, but nothing irregular. I assure you, I’ve been monitoring myself. It's just… the weight. It's not like I'm breathless climbing the stairs or anything of that nature.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to some other pertinent questions, then. Could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I haven’t had any serious illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, rubella – but nothing major. I had my appendix removed when I was twenty-three, and… oh, and I had a rather nasty bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Otherwise, I’m quite healthy, as far as I know. My husband, however… he has some heart trouble. But that’s not relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and bronchitis. Understandable. And your husband’s cardiac issues... while not directly relevant to you, family history can sometimes be illuminating. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. Not even a simple pain reliever, if I can avoid it. I prefer to… manage things myself, if possible. I find that a good rest and a cup of tea usually does the trick. I believe in natural remedies, when appropriate. But, no, absolutely no medications.
DOCTOR: “Manage things yourself.” I see. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, and I've never had a reaction to any sort of insect bite or plant, thankfully. My mother always said I had a very strong constitution. It’s served me well, I suppose. Although, it hasn’t helped with this weight gain, has it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Well, to proceed, could you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Well, we eat a fairly traditional Lithuanian diet, mostly. Lots of potatoes, rye bread, soups… I cook most meals from scratch. My husband enjoys pork, so there is some of that, but not excessively. We have vegetables with most meals, and fruit for dessert, usually apples or berries when they are in season. I try to limit sweets, but… well, I do enjoy a small piece of cake with my tea on occasion. But nothing extravagant, I assure you. It’s a balanced diet, I believe.
DOCTOR: Potatoes, rye bread, pork…and occasional cake. And what about your exercise routine?
PATIENT: Well, I don't have a formal "routine," Doctor, if that's what you mean. I do a lot of walking. I walk to the shops most days, and I enjoy gardening, which is quite strenuous, actually. I do a bit of housework, of course… scrubbing floors, that sort of thing. It's not a gym membership, if that's what you're looking for. But I’m quite active, all things considered. I certainly don’t sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination then. Could you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I do hope it’s accurate. I’ve been meaning to get a new one for some time now.
DOCTOR: 83 kilograms. And your height is 155 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. 155 centimeters, precisely. It is a bit higher than I remember, but… perhaps my old scale was faulty. I suppose it’s best to have an accurate measurement, regardless.
DOCTOR: Waist circumference is 92 centimeters. Now, if you’ll just turn around… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do appreciate you being so thorough. It's… reassuring, to have everything checked so carefully. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Findings are unremarkable, physically. However, your BMI is 34.3, which indicates obesity. Given your reported diet and activity level, and the recent weight gain, we will need to run some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We'll check your thyroid function, blood glucose, and a complete lipid panel. Do you have any objections to a simple blood draw?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely no objections. Blood tests are perfectly fine. If it will help determine the cause of this weight gain, I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. I suppose it’s best to be thorough, as you say. When can we schedule them?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall. I'll have a phlebotomist draw the samples now. Once the results are back – approximately five to seven business days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue your current diet and activity level. Try to limit the cake, if possible. It won't hurt anything, but it's best to be sensible. The phlebotomist is waiting for you.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate your attention to the matter. And I shall endeavor to limit the cake, as you suggest. Thank you. .
