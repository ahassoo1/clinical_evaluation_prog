DOCTOR: Right. Terasa Mayhugh. 59 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And… dizziness. It comes and goes, you see. Not all the time, thankfully. My daughter, Lani, she worried something fierce and booked this appointment. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a while now. It feels like... a long while.
DOCTOR: A long while. Right. That doesn't narrow it down much, does it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. I’m… not the best with dates, never have been. Things just sort of… happen. And then they’ve happened. My late husband, bless his soul, always remembered everything. But… well. It’s just been this feeling of fullness in my ear, and then everything spins for a bit. Not a pleasant bit, I can tell you that.
DOCTOR: Fullness and dizziness. Okay. And does anything trigger this dizziness?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. That’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It just… comes. Sometimes when I stand up quickly, maybe? But not always. I used to work at the casino, you see – dealing cards. Lots of standing. Didn't bother me then, though. Or… maybe it did? Oh dear, it’s all a bit hazy. Lani says my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Casino work… standing for long periods. Okay. And when you say fullness, is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, usually just the left one. The left ear feels… blocked, like there's cotton wool in it. And then the spinning starts. It doesn't last long, thank goodness, maybe a few minutes. But it’s unsettling, you know? Makes it hard to walk straight. And… my mum, she used to get something similar. Something with her balance, I think.
DOCTOR: Your mother had balance issues?
PATIENT: Yes… well, Lani told me. I was quite young when she got sick, you see. I just remember she used to stumble a lot, and she’d get these awful headaches. The doctor said something about… her inner ear, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t recall the exact name of it, dear. Everything gets so mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, dizziness and a feeling of fullness in the left ear, possibly linked to your mother’s history. Let's do a quick examination. I'm going to check your ears, look at your balance, and do a few other tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, dear. Just try not to make it too complicated, alright? My head gets muddled easily. And… please be gentle, my ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's take a look in your ears. Just relax and look straight ahead. This might be a little chilly. Hmm. There's a bit of cerumen build-up in the left ear canal. And the tympanic membrane… appears normal, but slightly retracted. Right ear looks clear. Now, I'm going to perform a few balance tests. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Careful now… my knees aren’t what they used to be. Balance tests… what will these involve, dear? I do hope it doesn't involve spinning! That dizziness is quite enough, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: No spinning, I assure you. Just some simple movements. First, I want you to stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes. Just try to maintain your balance. And I'll be right here if you need me. Go ahead when you're ready.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. This isn’t good, is it? Whoa… steady now, steady now. This is harder than it looks. It feels… wobbly. I think I’m going to fall.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. That's alright. Yes, your balance is quite compromised. Alright. We'll take it easy. Now, let's check your hearing. I'm going to place some headphones on and play some tones at different frequencies. Just tell me when you hear a sound, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You caught me just in time. My legs… they aren't as strong as they used to be. Yes, the hearing test sounds fine. Just let me know when it starts, alright? I sometimes don’t hear the quiet ones, you see. Or… maybe I hear them, but I’m not sure. It’s all a bit muddled, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with a low frequency and gradually increase it. Just raise your hand when you hear anything, even if it's faint. Do you hear anything now?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. Nothing at all. Just a… quiet buzzing. Is it supposed to be a loud sound? Or… maybe it’s just my ears playing tricks on me again. It's very quiet, dear. Really quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s try this frequency. Any sound now?
PATIENT: Oh… yes! Yes, I think so. A very faint… beep? Is that right? It’s very… soft. Hard to tell, really. But I think I heard something. But… maybe it was just my imagination.
DOCTOR: Alright. The hearing test indicates some hearing loss, particularly in the left ear, which correlates with your symptoms. And the balance issues are concerning. Based on what I've found, it appears you are experiencing vestibular dysfunction, potentially combined with age-related hearing loss. It's likely the issues in your inner ear are contributing to both your dizziness and balance problems. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Vestibular… what now? And… age-related hearing loss? Well, I am getting on a bit, I suppose. But dizziness… that's not very pleasant. And my mum, she had balance issues… is this what she had? It all sounds very complicated, dear. Are you going to give me some medicine for it?
DOCTOR: Vestibular dysfunction refers to a problem with the inner ear system responsible for balance. It explains the dizziness and sway we observed during the tests. And yes, your mother's issues could very well be related. As for medication, there are options to help manage the symptoms, primarily medications for motion sickness and to reduce vertigo. However, the best course of action often involves vestibular rehabilitation therapy – exercises to help your brain compensate for the inner ear imbalance. I'm going to write you a referral to an audiologist for a more comprehensive hearing evaluation and to a physical therapist specializing in vestibular rehabilitation. And I'll prescribe a short course of meclizine, an over-the-counter motion sickness medication, to help with the dizziness in the meantime. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An audiologist… and a physical therapist… Oh dear. That sounds like a lot of appointments. But… if it will help, I suppose I should do it. Vertigo… that's what you call the dizziness, isn't it? Yes, that sounds right. Meclizine… is that easy to take? I don't want anything too complicated. And… will this fix it? Will I be able to walk without falling again?
DOCTOR: It is a lot, I understand. But both the audiologist and physical therapist are specialists who can help improve your balance and reduce the dizziness. Meclizine is a simple over-the-counter medication; just one tablet twice a day. It can help minimize the sensation of spinning. As for whether it will "fix" it… unfortunately, vestibular dysfunction can be chronic. However, with consistent therapy and medication, we can often significantly improve your symptoms and help you regain your balance and confidence. Here are the referrals and the prescription. I recommend scheduling appointments as soon as possible. And if the dizziness becomes severe or you experience any new symptoms, like difficulty speaking or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Emergency room… oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. But alright, I’ll try to book the appointments. Lani will help me with that, I’m sure. She’s very organized. Well, thank you, dear. You've been very patient with me. It’s just… all a bit overwhelming, as I said. I think that’s all my questions for now. I just want to be able to walk without falling, you see. And… maybe hear a bit better. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write a note to your primary care physician as well, so they are aware of the findings. Please follow up with the specialists as soon as possible. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Terasa.
