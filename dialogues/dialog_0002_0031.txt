DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen, and I do have a… a heart thing. The doctors told me it was atrial… fibrillation, I believe they said. It's been happening for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, thanks for letting me know, Nixon. Swelling in one leg and a history of atrial fibrillation – that gives us a good starting point. When you say “a bit now”, how long exactly has the swelling been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, maybe a week ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little puffiness, really. But it's gotten worse each day. I noticed it more after I was on my feet all day last Tuesday, teaching.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a week ago, starting with mild puffiness, and worsening with activity, specifically standing for long periods while teaching. That’s helpful. And is the swelling in your entire left leg, or just certain parts of it, like your foot, ankle, or calf?
PATIENT: Mostly in my calf, I think. And my ankle feels a bit… tight. My foot isn’t too bad, but the calf is definitely the worst of it. It feels heavy, too. Not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mainly in the calf, with some tightness in the ankle, and a feeling of heaviness. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, or any skin changes at all?
PATIENT: No, no redness or warmth. The skin feels… normal, I suppose. It doesn’t feel any different to the touch, and there aren’t any cuts or anything. It just feels heavy and swollen, like I said. Is that… concerning? I’m not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay to not be familiar with medical terminology – that’s what I’m here for! It’s good that you haven’t noticed any redness or warmth. Swelling like this, especially with a history of atrial fibrillation, does need to be checked out, but we'll figure it out. Before we do a quick exam of your leg, let's talk a little more about your atrial fibrillation. Do you currently take any medication for it?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take… let me see if I remember the name… Apixaban. That's it. One pill, twice a day. And I have been taking it regularly, I promise! I try very hard to remember, but sometimes… well, I am a bit forgetful. But mostly I remember.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you’re on Apixaban, and that you generally remember to take it – it’s an important medication. It's okay to be forgetful sometimes, we all have moments! Okay, let’s take a look at your leg now. Could you please sit on the examination table and I’ll take a look?
PATIENT: Alright, yes, of course. Please, do take your time. It's just… a bit uncomfortable, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. I'm feeling your calf now. It does feel noticeably warmer than your right leg, and there’s definitely some swelling present. I also see some mild pitting edema – when I press on your skin, it leaves a little indentation for a few seconds. That suggests some fluid buildup. Your pulses feel normal, and I don’t see any obvious skin changes. I'm also checking the skin temperature. It is warm to the touch. Do you experience any pain when I flex your foot upwards like this?
PATIENT: No, no pain when you do that. It feels a bit… tight, maybe? But no sharp pain, or anything like that. Just a bit of resistance. It’s much the same when I move my toes, actually. Not painful, just… not as easy as it should be. Is that bad? I'm sorry to keep asking. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Nixon. It's good you're asking questions – it shows you're engaged in your care, and I want you to feel comfortable. The tightness without pain is good. We need to rule out a few things. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the swelling could be related to your atrial fibrillation, potentially causing some fluid retention, or it could be something else. To be safe, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test. This will help us rule out a blood clot in your leg, which is a serious, but treatable, condition. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. But… if it will tell us what's going on, yes, please. Anything to figure out what’s causing this. If it's serious, the sooner we know, the better, I suppose. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried when you hear "blood clot," Nixon. It's good we’re checking it out. The D-dimer test is a simple blood draw, just like getting blood work done at a routine checkup. There’s very minimal discomfort – just a quick pinch when the needle goes in. Okay, I'll write the order for the D-dimer test now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. While we wait for the results, I also want to be cautious. I recommend elevating your leg as much as possible, and avoiding prolonged standing. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've had… well, I had the chickenpox as a child, but that was a long time ago. And I can eat pretty much anything. No reactions to any medicines before, as far as I recall. I’m… fairly straightforward, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nixon. Straightforward is great! Okay, so no known allergies. While we're waiting for the lab results, I want to discuss some "red flags" to watch out for. If you experience any sudden, severe pain in your chest, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, or if the swelling in your leg suddenly gets much worse, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and worsening swelling. Emergency room. That… sounds very serious. I’ll remember that. Do you think it’s likely to come to that? I'm getting a little anxious, if I'm honest. I live quite far from the nearest hospital, you see. It would be a long drive.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. It’s not likely to come to that, Nixon, but it's always best to be prepared. I’m ordering the test as a precaution to rule out anything serious, and so far, your symptoms don’t suggest an emergency. The most likely cause is fluid retention related to your atrial fibrillation, but we need to be thorough. I also want to check your kidney function with a basic metabolic panel to see if that could be contributing to the swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, if it will help figure things out, yes. Kidneys… are those important for fluid? I always forget everything the doctors tell me as soon as I leave the room. I suppose I should bring a notebook next time. But yes, check my kidneys. The more information the better, I suppose. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. And yes, kidneys are very important for fluid balance – they help remove extra fluid from your body. Don't worry about forgetting things; that’s why I’m here to explain everything. Bringing a notebook is a great idea! Okay, I'll add that to the lab order as well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some more blood. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend a compression stocking for your left leg. It will help improve circulation and reduce swelling. Do you have any compression stockings already?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any compression stockings. I’ve never worn them before. They sound… tight? Will they be uncomfortable? I do worry about things being constricting, you see. I get a little… claustrophobic sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Nixon. It’s good you mention that. Compression stockings do feel snug, but they shouldn’t be constricting. They come in different levels of compression, and we can start with a mild level to see how you tolerate it. They’re designed to support your leg and improve blood flow, not to cut off circulation. I’ll write a prescription for a mild compression stocking for you. You can pick it up at most pharmacies. The pharmacist can help you find the right size and show you how to put it on. If it feels too tight or uncomfortable at any point, stop wearing it and let me know. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, a mild one sounds much better. And if it feels too tight, I can stop using it. That’s good to know. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think I’m starting to feel a little calmer now. Just waiting for the results is the worst part, isn't it? I do hate waiting.
DOCTOR: It is the worst part, Nixon, you're absolutely right! Waiting is never easy. It gives us a chance to talk while we wait, though. While we wait for the lab results, do you have any questions for me about your atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. It’s just… the doctors explained it when I was first diagnosed, but I don’t really remember much of it. They said something about irregular heartbeat… but what does that mean exactly? And is it… dangerous? I worry about it causing a… a stroke, I think they said something about that. It all feels very complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Nixon, and it's perfectly normal to be confused about medical terms. Let's break it down. Your heart has a natural rhythm, like a steady beat. Atrial fibrillation, or "AFib" as we often call it, happens when the upper chambers of your heart beat irregularly – kind of like a flutter instead of a steady beat. This irregular beating doesn't usually feel immediately life-threatening, but over time, it can cause blood to pool in the heart, which can increase the risk of forming a blood clot. If that clot travels to your brain, it can cause a stroke. That’s why you're on Apixaban – it’s a blood thinner that helps prevent clots from forming. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make more sense, thank you. Blood pooling… and the Apixaban helps prevent clots. So, the irregular heartbeat is the problem, and the medicine protects me. It's still a bit scary, but I understand it a little better now. Are there things I can do to help prevent the irregular heartbeat, or is it just… something I have to live with? I do try to stay active, but I get tired easily, you see.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Nixon. It's good to feel like you're understanding it more. That's a great question. While there's no guaranteed way to completely prevent AFib, there are definitely things you can do to manage it and reduce the frequency of episodes. Staying active is excellent, even if you get tired easily – gentle exercise is best. Other things that can help include managing stress, getting enough sleep, avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol, and keeping any other health conditions, like high blood pressure or thyroid problems, under control. We can also discuss a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – who can do some further testing to see if there's a specific cause for your AFib and recommend the best course of treatment. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… yes, that sounds sensible. If there's a specific cause, it would be good to know what it is. I do try to manage my stress, but it's difficult sometimes. And I do enjoy a cup of tea in the evenings… perhaps I should cut back on that. What kind of testing would they do? And will it be… uncomfortable? I do worry about medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly okay to be worried about medical things, Nixon. We can definitely take things one step at a time. A cardiologist would likely start with an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which is a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. They might also recommend a Holter monitor – a small, portable device that you wear for a day or two to record your heart rhythm over a longer period. And they could order an echocardiogram, or echo, which is an ultrasound of your heart that provides images of its structure and function. The echo is generally painless, although they might need to apply some gel to your chest. The other tests are completely non-invasive. I can write a referral for you today. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. In the meantime, if you’re still concerned about your symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Oh, and while cutting back on caffeine is a good idea, don't feel you have to eliminate it completely! Just moderate your intake. And… the nurse should be back shortly with the results of your blood tests. Are you ready to hear them?
PATIENT: Yes, I think I’m ready. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It makes me feel much better, knowing what to expect. Please, tell me the results. I’ll try not to worry, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. The D-dimer test came back slightly elevated. This suggests there could be a blood clot in your leg, but it's not definitive. It can be elevated for other reasons, too. The basic metabolic panel came back normal, so your kidney function is fine. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order a venous ultrasound of your left leg. This will use sound waves to create an image of the veins and confirm whether or not there’s a blood clot. It’s a painless test, and we can do it right here in the clinic. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A venous ultrasound… to look at the veins. Yes, that sounds sensible. If the D-dimer is only slightly elevated, it’s good to check with the ultrasound. So, it's not definitely a blood clot, just… a possibility? I do get anxious about things like that. Can it be treated if there is a blood clot? I've heard… things.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious, Nixon. It's not a definite blood clot, and that’s why we’re doing the ultrasound. And yes, blood clots are treatable! The most common treatment is with blood thinners, like the Apixaban you're already taking. In some cases, they might also use compression stockings or, rarely, other procedures to remove the clot. The earlier a blood clot is diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome. We’re taking all the right steps to figure out what’s going on and get you the best possible care. I’ll go ahead and get the order for the ultrasound, and the technician will be in shortly to perform the test. While we wait, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think I just need to wait for the results. And try not to worry too much. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate that. I’m ready when the technician is ready.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Nixon. You’re very welcome, and you’re doing a good job staying calm. I'll let the technician know you're ready, and they’ll be in shortly. I’ll also check back in with you after the ultrasound to discuss the results and make a plan. In the meantime, try to relax. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
