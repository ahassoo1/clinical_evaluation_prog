DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's...it's my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble…going. It just takes me a long time, and sometimes it doesn't come out all at once, if you know what I mean. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty with urination. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It's not painful, exactly. More…straining. And I find myself going more often, especially at night. I didn’t used to have to get up at all, but now…sometimes two or three times. It's a bit disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, straining, increased frequency, and nocturia – waking up two or three times at night to urinate. Is there any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, no burning at all. It doesn't hurt when it’s coming out, just…difficult to start and then difficult to finish, you know? And like I said, it feels like I never quite empty my bladder completely. It’s…uncomfortable afterwards, a sort of fullness. I do drink a fair bit of tea, I suppose. Black tea, mostly. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that detail about the black tea is helpful. Caffeine can certainly play a role. And the feeling of incomplete emptying is important. Do you notice any leakage of urine with coughing, sneezing, or laughing?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Not with coughing or sneezing, anyway. Laughing…well, I don’t laugh that much these days, to be honest. But no, I haven't noticed any leakage. It's mostly just the trouble getting it started and the feeling afterwards, like there's still some left in there. And the frequent trips at night, of course. It’s tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. No, not really. It looks…normal, I think. Pale yellow, like it should be. I haven’t noticed any strong smells either. I did have a bit of a cold last month, but that's gone now. I drink plenty of water during the day, you see. I try to, anyway. To counteract the tea.
DOCTOR: Good. Staying hydrated is good. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a small pill, and it seems to be alright now. I take that every morning. Other than that… no, nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was young, but that was ages ago. No diabetes, no kidney problems, to my knowledge. I get a check-up every year with my regular doctor, and he hasn't said anything about anything like that. I have Medicare, so they usually catch things, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the blood pressure medication. And annual check-ups are excellent. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have the bottle right here. It’s…Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, thank you. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… besides the Lisinopril, I take a multivitamin every day. Just a standard one, you know, for older people. And sometimes, when my joints are aching, I take ibuprofen. But not very often, maybe once or twice a month if I've been gardening or something. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her baking, and she used all sorts of things, nuts and fruit and whatnot. Never a problem. I can eat anything, thankfully. I'm a fairly simple person, really. No allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as kidney disease, bladder problems, or prostate issues in the men?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tricky one. My parents both lived to be quite old, but I don't really remember them having too many health problems. My father had a bit of heart trouble towards the end, I think. And my mother had arthritis, like me. As for kidney or bladder problems… I don’t recall anyone specifically having those. I have a brother, but we’re not very close, and I haven’t spoken to him in years. He lives in Lithuania, you see. I wouldn’t know what ailments he has, if any. There were no prostate issues, as far as I know; my father didn’t live long enough for that to be a concern. Mostly just…old age things, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… Well, I live alone in a small apartment. I try to stay active. I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice, and I walk to the shops most days. I used to volunteer at the library, but I had to stop during the pandemic, and haven't gotten back to it yet. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I eat fairly healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. I like to read, mostly mysteries. A quiet life, really. Not much excitement. I get by.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also do a gentle pelvic exam. It’s standard procedure for assessing these types of symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A…a pelvic exam? Well, I haven’t had one of those in…a very long time. Is it really necessary? I mean, I'm 66, and I’m just having trouble going to the bathroom. I always feel a bit…embarrassed with those. Could we maybe try something else first? Perhaps just more questions? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Yadao. You are absolutely right to express your concerns. A pelvic exam allows me to assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles and check for any physical abnormalities that could be contributing to your symptoms. However, we can certainly proceed cautiously. Before we proceed, I want to assure you that this examination will be done with the utmost respect and sensitivity. I will explain every step beforehand, and you are free to stop at any time. If you're still uncomfortable, we can focus on some other initial tests, like a urine analysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. Would that be more acceptable to you at this time?
PATIENT: A urine analysis sounds much better, yes. That doesn’t sound…invasive. I’d feel a lot more comfortable with that. And then maybe we can talk about the results and see what the doctor thinks? I really don't like the idea of the other exam right now, if it’s alright with you. Thank you for understanding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. A urine analysis is a great first step. I’ll get a sample cup, and I’ll show you how to collect a clean sample. It's important to try and get a mid-stream sample for the most accurate results. Then we’ll send it off to the lab and discuss the findings when they come back. It usually takes a couple of days. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the urine sample?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Mid-stream, you said? I remember something about that from…years ago. Just try to get a little bit in the middle. Is that right? And it will take a couple of days to get the results? That sounds good. I suppose I'll go to the restroom now, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Mid-stream is correct. And yes, the results usually take a couple of days to come back. I’ll have the nurse let you know when they’re available. The restroom is just down the hall on your right. There’s a privacy room inside. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any trouble. I'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I'll be right back.
