DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Lindra Abdollahi, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Lindra. Is good to meet you, Doctor… Doctor… what was it? My memory, you know. Not so good these days.
DOCTOR: DeChene. Carrington DeChene. And frankly, we all have our moments. Now, let’s not dwell on that. What brings you in today, Mrs. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor DeChene. Good. My son, he say I need… papers? For the… the place. For when I am… older. He say I need to make sure everything is okay before I go live there. A senior place, he call it.
DOCTOR: A senior facility, yes. So, a general check-up to ensure you're fit for a transition, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is right. To make sure I am… strong enough. And not too much trouble. My son, he worry. He say they need to know everything. What I can do, what I cannot.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll certainly try to cover everything. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Hmm… doctor… before, yes. But not for… many years. I mostly just… take some tea for my aches. And the little pills for my water. You know, when I have to go. Not much trouble, usually. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: We need more than "not much trouble," Mrs. Abdollahi. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions? Like… sickness? I had a bad cough once, many years ago. And my feet… they hurt sometimes. But the doctor, he said it was just… old age. Nothing to do too much about. I don't know any names for sicknesses. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful to have some specifics, but we can work with this. Let's try this way. Do you have any trouble with your heart or lungs?
PATIENT: No, no trouble. I walk… slow, maybe. But I can walk. And I can sing! Sometimes I get a little… breathless when I climb the stairs, but who climbs stairs these days? Not me!
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your blood sugar?
PATIENT: Blood… sugar? You mean like… in the sweet things I eat? I like a little chocolate sometimes. Is that bad? My son, he always say I eat too much sugar. He say it's not good for me. But a little piece never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: We’re not discussing your diet right now, Mrs. Abdollahi. Have you been told you have high blood sugar?
PATIENT: No, no one tell me. Just my son, he complain. He say I should eat more… vegetables. And less chocolate. But I don’t feel sick. Is that what you ask? I feel… old, but not sick. Is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just the little pills for my water. And sometimes, when my feet hurt very bad, I take… I think it's called ibuprofen? The little white ones. But not every day. Only when they really, really ache. My neighbor, she give me some, she say it's good for old people. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. I like flowers, I smell them. And cats! I always have cats. Never bother me. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy with dust, but everyone does, no? Is that an allergy? I don't know these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed with a physical exam, then. Perhaps that will give us a clearer picture. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can stand. Slow, maybe, but I can. Is this… will it take long? I get tired easy, you know.
DOCTOR: Just a basic assessment, Mrs. Abdollahi. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and reflexes. Please, sit here. Breathing appears normal, slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, consistent with age. Blood pressure is 140/90. Elevated. Reflexes are diminished, but within expected range for her age. Now, let's take a look at your feet. No open wounds or signs of infection, some mild edema. I recommend a podiatry consult to address the edema.
PATIENT: Pod… what? You mean the doctor for my feet? My son, he always say I need to see a doctor for my feet. But they ache a little, is all. Is okay. But maybe, yes, the doctor for my feet… if you think so. Is this… is this bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Mrs. Abdollahi. Just… preventative. We want to ensure the edema isn’t indicative of a more serious underlying issue. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. Routine tests – complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function. It’ll give us a baseline. We’ll also schedule an EKG to assess your heart health.
PATIENT: EKG? More tests? My son is going to be so happy. He always want me to have so many tests. Is… is this because I am old? Is that it? I just want to live in the nice place, is all. I don't want too much trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s standard protocol before a transition to assisted living, Mrs. Abdollahi. We need to establish a clear medical picture. I will write the orders for the blood work and EKG now. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will schedule the EKG for you. I’ll also put in a referral for the podiatry consult. We’ll review the results when they come in and discuss a plan. Does that sound… acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… yes. I guess so. But so many doctors! My son will be very pleased, I think. He worry so much. Okay, you write the papers, and I go to the lab. Is that right? And then… the foot doctor? I just hope they don't find anything too bad.
DOCTOR: Exactly. The lab results will take a few days, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. Here’s the referral for the podiatry consult. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: .
