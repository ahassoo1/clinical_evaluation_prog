DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. Well, I'm planning a cruise, you see – a lovely one around the Mediterranean – and the cruise line needs some information from a doctor. Just to say I'm fit enough to travel, really. A formality, I expect. It's August the 2nd, isn’t it? A beautiful day for a cruise, it would be.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. A lovely day indeed, and a Mediterranean cruise sounds wonderful. It's quite common for cruise lines to request a physician's clearance. To help me complete this form for you, could you tell me a little bit more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, I was married for a good many years to a lovely man, but he passed on five years ago now. Sad time, that was. But I keep busy. I work as a merchandise displayer, you see – window trimming, mostly. Keeps me on my feet. As for my health… I don't really have any health problems, if I’m honest. A little ache here and there, as you get older, but nothing serious. I don’t take any regular medicines. Not insured, sadly. Just… generally fit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Squiers. It's good that you keep busy, that's important. And it's reassuring to hear you generally feel fit. Just to be thorough, and to document everything accurately for the cruise line, could you tell me if you've had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Significant illnesses… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing that needed a long stay in hospital, certainly. As for surgeries… I had my tonsils out when I was a wee girl, maybe seven or eight years old. A very long time ago now, and no bother since. And… oh, I had a cyst removed from my wrist, perhaps ten years ago. Small thing, really. Local anesthetic, done and dusted in an afternoon. Other than that… no, I’m fairly sure that’s all. I have a very good memory for these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child and a cyst removal from the wrist ten years ago. Good to know. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family. My sister, Morag, lives up in Inverness. She’s a bit older than me, always was the sensible one. She’s perfectly well, as far as I know. Keeps herself to herself mostly. My parents are… well, they’re gone now, both of them. Passed on years ago. They had good health, for the most part. My father had a touch of arthritis in his later years, but nothing dramatic. And my mother… she just wore out, I suppose. Old age, mostly. No family history of anything serious, if that's what you mean? No heart trouble or anything like that.
DOCTOR: No significant family history of heart trouble or other major illnesses. That's helpful. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me about any allergies you might have?
PATIENT: Allergies, now… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think I have any serious allergies. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes with dust, but that’s just a seasonal thing, isn’t it? And I'm not keen on shellfish, but that's more a dislike than an allergy, I suspect. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. No trouble with pollen, no itchy skin, no swelling… nothing like that. I can take most medicines without a problem, too. I've never had a bad response to an antibiotic or anything. Is that what you mean by allergies?
DOCTOR: No known drug or food allergies, mild seasonal dust sensitivity. Very good. And just one final question before we move on to a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I certainly don't smoke. Never have. My husband didn't approve, you see. And I only have a small glass of sherry with my dinner sometimes. A very small glass. Just to help me relax. And… well, recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I wouldn't know where to begin. I'm a very sensible woman, you see. Always have been. I don't believe in those sorts of things. So, no to all three, then. Perfectly healthy, in that respect, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Squiers. It sounds like you live a very healthy lifestyle. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to just perform a brief physical exam to make sure everything is as you’ve described. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, perfectly alright. A quick check is sensible, I suppose. I’m not one to fuss, you know. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My heart's always been strong, as far as I know. And my lungs… well, I do a bit of gardening, keeps me breathing, I expect! Just let me know if anything feels… odd. I'm a bit ticklish, though, so be warned! Shall I sit up on the examination table?
DOCTOR: Yes, please sit up on the examination table. And thank you for letting me know about the ticklishness! I’ll do my best to be gentle. Take a deep breath for me, please… and another one… good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal in appearance. Throat is clear, no signs of redness or swelling. Overall, your examination is unremarkable. Everything sounds and looks well.
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't so bad at all! I told you I wasn't one to fuss. Good to hear everything's as it should be. Unremarkable is good, isn't it? Means I'm not falling apart, I suppose! So, what happens now, Doctor? Will you fill out that form for the cruise line? I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I’m rather eager to get the booking confirmed, you see. They have a lovely cabin with a balcony…
DOCTOR: Yes, unremarkable is very good. It means everything is functioning as it should be. And yes, I’m completing the form for the cruise line now. It’s a fairly straightforward process, just confirming your good health and fitness to travel. Here we are. This form states that you are in good general health and medically cleared for travel. I've also noted your tonsillectomy as a child and cyst removal from the wrist, as a matter of record. Does that all seem correct to you?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Yes, that sounds absolutely right. Tonsils and the cyst… you have a very good memory, Doctor! It's reassuring to know you've recorded everything so accurately. Excellent. This will do nicely, I expect. Thank you very much for your time and trouble, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Now I can enjoy planning my cruise without any worries. Do I need to pay for this, then? Is it covered by… well, it's not covered by insurance, I’m afraid. But I'm happy to settle the bill.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. The cost of the consultation is £85. We accept cash or card. I also have some brochures on travel vaccinations, if you are interested. It’s always good to be prepared, especially when travelling to different regions. But that’s entirely up to you, of course. Either way, I wish you a wonderful and safe cruise! Do let me know if any concerns arise before your trip.
PATIENT: £85, right. Here you are. Keep the change, it's a lovely day. And thank you for the offer of the brochures, but I think I'll be alright without them, thank you. I’m not travelling anywhere too exotic, just the Mediterranean. I appreciate your thoughtfulness, though. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. And I will certainly let you know if anything… well, if anything does happen! Thank you again, and goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. Enjoy your cruise! And don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you need anything at all. Goodbye, and have a lovely time.
