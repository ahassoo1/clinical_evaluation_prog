DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor... Nooro... Nooro... It’s, uh, about the team. The soccer team. My grandson, he says I gotta get checked out before I... before I try out. Old man’s soccer, you know? He worries too much, that boy.
DOCTOR: Soccer, alright. Well, it's good your grandson is looking out for you. Even if he is a bit overprotective. Still, better safe than sorry. So, you're hoping to join an old man's soccer team...and he wants me to give you the okay first. That's responsible of him. Now, tell me, how long have you been playing soccer, off and on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Since I was a little boy, back in… back in the old country. Spain. A lifetime ago, really. Not much lately, though. Just kickin’ the ball around with the grandkids sometimes. A few games here and there. Not like when I was young, for sure. My knees ain’t what they used to be, that’s for certain.
DOCTOR: Right, Spain. And you’ve been playing on and off for… quite a while then. And your grandson is concerned about your knees, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, my knees. They kinda… ache. Especially when it's cold, or if I do too much. Not always, you understand. Just… sometimes. He keeps sayin’ I should be careful. He's a good boy, always lookin’ out for his old Papa.
DOCTOR: It’s good you have such a caring grandson. Okay, so the knee pain is intermittent… worse with cold weather and activity. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Inter… what? Sorry, Doctor. I don’t… Comes and goes, that’s what I mean. Like a little… a little twinge. Not a sharp pain, usually. More like a… a dull ache. Sometimes stiff. Hard to explain. It’s just…old, you know? Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Right, “old man problems.” I understand. But we still need to figure out what's going on with those knees. Is the pain in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Or… maybe it switches. One day it’s this one, and the next it's that one. It's not always both at the same time. But mostly, they both bother me some way or another. It's hard to keep track, Doctor. My memory... it ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, shifting bilateral knee pain. And you mentioned it's worse with cold weather. Does anything help the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, resting helps. Just sittin’ still. And… a warm bath sometimes. My wife, she puts Epsom salts in the water. That feels good. And… rubbin’ it. Just rubbin’ my knees. Gentle, you know? Not too hard.
DOCTOR: Rest, warm bath with Epsom salts, and gentle massage help. Do you notice any swelling or stiffness in the knees, especially in the mornings?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes, maybe. Not a lot, but… I think so. Especially if I’ve been walkin’ a lot the day before. And stiffness… yes, in the mornin’s for sure. Takes a little while to get goin’. Gotta kinda… work it out. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Stiffness in the mornings, improving with activity, and occasional swelling. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your knees?
PATIENT: Injuries… Oh, goodness. A long time ago, when I was playin’… back in Spain, I think I twisted one. Not bad, nothin’ serious. Just a little… tweak. I don’t remember much about it now. It was a long time ago! No broken bones or nothin’ like that. Just… a little bump.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Arthritis… my wife keeps sayin’ I probably do. But the doctor… I saw a doctor a few years back and he didn’t say nothin’ about arthritis. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. My blood sugar is okay, I think. And heart… I get a little… puffed sometimes when I climb the stairs. But mostly, I’m alright. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. "Possible arthritis – wife’s concern, no formal diagnosis. No known diabetes. Reports mild dyspnea on exertion." Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Just a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those… those over-the-counter ones. The ones for sleepin’. Somethin’ with a ‘P’ in it…
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril for blood pressure and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. My wife keeps sayin’ I’m lucky. I can eat anythin’, touch anythin’. Never had a problem. I’m a pretty tough old man, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your knees. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust you. Go ahead. I just hope you don't find too much wrong!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. I'll start with a look at your knees while you’re lying down, and then we’ll have you sit up and move them a bit. First, let’s just take a look. Do you mind if I gently feel around your knees?
PATIENT: No, no problem at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m ready. Careful now, these old bones ain’t as flexible as they used to be!
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just feeling around now... Okay, there's some mild tenderness here, on the inner side of the right knee. And a little bit of crepitus – that’s a bit of a grinding sensation – when I bend it. Now, the left knee… Hmm. Similar tenderness on the inner side, and also some crepitus. A little bit of effusion – that's a slight swelling – but not significant. Okay, let's see how far you can bend both knees. Gently bring your heel towards your buttocks... How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh… that feels a little… tight. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but… it’s stiff. Not as easy as it used to be. This is about as far as I can go without… well, without makin' a fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about the left knee?
PATIENT: Oof… this one's a bit worse. It feels… like somethin’s blockin’ it. A little uncomfortable, you know? Not bad, but… definitely tighter. Getting old ain’t for the faint of heart, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you could sit up slowly for me. I'm going to check the stability of both knees. Okay… both knees are stable, thankfully. No significant ligamentous laxity. Okay, Mr. Murph. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you have some osteoarthritis in both knees. It's very common, especially as we get older. It’s causing the pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion that you've been experiencing. The crepitus is the grinding sensation, and the tenderness indicates inflammation.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Sounds… serious. Is it bad, Doctor? Will I have to… stop playin’ soccer?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious serious, Mr. Murph. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition, meaning it gets worse over time. But it's very manageable, and a lot of people live full, active lives with it. As for soccer… it depends. It doesn’t mean you have to stop completely, but you might need to modify how you play. We need to get it under control first. Now, we can start with some conservative treatments: physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to reduce inflammation, and weight management if you're carrying any extra weight. We can also look at some assistive devices like a knee brace to provide support. Would you be open to starting with those things?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… sounds… hard. But I guess I can try. Pain relievers… yeah, I can do that. And… weight management… well, my wife’s always tellin’ me to lose a few pounds. So, you think that might help me keep playin’ soccer? Even a little bit?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Murph. I think that’s a very reasonable goal. The key is to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. We'll work on strengthening those muscles around your knees to provide support, and the pain relievers can help manage any discomfort. I'm going to write you a prescription for ibuprofen, and I'll give you a referral to a physical therapist. I want you to start physical therapy twice a week for a month, and then we'll reassess. In the meantime, avoid any activities that significantly worsen your pain, and try to stay as active as you can within your limits. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Twice a week… okay, I think I can manage that. And… listen to my body… my wife says the same thing. Um… Will the pain relievers… make me sleepy? And… how long before I see some improvement?
DOCTOR: Good questions, Mr. Murph. Ibuprofen can sometimes cause drowsiness as a side effect, but it’s not very common. If you find it’s making you too sleepy, you can take it with food or switch to naproxen, which is less likely to cause that side effect. We'll start with ibuprofen, though, and see how you tolerate it. As for improvement… it varies from person to person. You should start to feel some reduction in pain and stiffness within a week or two of starting physical therapy and taking the pain relievers consistently. The physical therapist will teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion, and that will help long-term. It's not a quick fix, but with consistent effort, we can definitely improve your quality of life and hopefully get you back on the soccer field, even if it’s just for a little while. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. You've explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to an old man's aches and pains. And for not tellin' me to hang up my boots right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Murph. I’m happy to help. And absolutely not! Staying active is important, and we'll do everything we can to keep you doing what you enjoy, safely. Here are your prescriptions and the referral to the physical therapist. The physical therapist will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you in about a month to see how you're progressing. In the meantime, take care of yourself, listen to your body, and try to have some fun.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. And I’ll try not to push myself too hard. I promise. I appreciate everything you’ve done. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Murph. Take care, and I’ll see you next month.
