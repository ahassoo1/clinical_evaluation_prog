DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard, welcome. I'm Dr. Havird. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… something down there. A little… leakin’. Not good, you know? Been happenin’ a bit now. I don’t… I don't really know why it’s happenin’. It’s… messy.
DOCTOR: "A little leakin’," you say. Okay. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it slips away, doesn't it? Maybe… a month? Could be longer. I don’t keep track of these things. It just… started. I thought it would go away on its own, but it hasn't. You know how it is. Things just… happen. And usually they stop. This one didn’t. It’s… botherin’ me now, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. A month or so. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Not all the time, thankfully. Mostly… when I… well, when I’m restin’. Or after. Not when I’m busy, you understand. I’m always busy. Gotta keep movin’. It’s… better when I’m doin’ things. Does that make sense? It’s just… a little somethin’ when I stop.
DOCTOR: So, it happens mostly when you're at rest, or after activity… okay. Is it painful at all, or just… bothersome?
PATIENT: Painful? No, no. Not painful. It’s… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s not right. A little… itchy sometimes. Mostly just… wet. I don’t like wet. Makes things sticky, you know? And smells a little funny, but I bathe regular. It's just… there. And now it's botherin' me enough to come here. I don’t usually go to doctors. Waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urine – the color, the smell, anything like that, aside from the… leakage?
PATIENT: Urine? Oh… well, looks normal, I think. Yellow, like it always is. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink plenty of water. I don't really look at it, you know? Just… go. And get on with things. It’s never bothered me before, the color or anything. Mostly just… this leakin’ now. And the smell. A little funny smell, but like I said, I bathe. It's probably just… old age, right? Things start smellin' funny when you get old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or medical problems with your bladder or anything “down there” before?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, goodness no! I’m Chamorro, you know. We don't do surgeries. Too much trouble. And besides, what would be the point? Things usually fix themselves. I’ve had babies, of course, a long time ago, but that's it. No problems with that, nothin’ serious. Just… babies. And this leakin’ now. That's it, I think. I don’t go to doctors, remember? So, nothin' to fix. Mostly just… livin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no pills. I don’t like pills. They make you feel funny. I take a little… herbal tea sometimes, for my stomach. But that’s it. All natural, you know. And allergies… not that I know of. Never had much trouble with medicine. Just… don’t take it. Better that way. Less trouble. Now, are you gonna fix this leakin’ or just ask questions all day? It's gettin' a little embarassin', you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I understand your frustration. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh… well. I… I don’t know. I don’t really do exams. Sounds… invasive. What exactly are you gonna do? And will it take long? I have things to do, you know. Always busy. Can't just sit around bein' poked and prodded all day. Is there another way? Maybe just give me somethin' to drink? Stop the leakin’ that way?
DOCTOR: It’s a simple exam, Mrs. Genard. I just need to take a look at the area to see what might be causing the leakage. It will only take a few minutes. It's important to understand why this is happening before I can recommend a treatment. I understand your reluctance, but it’s the best way to help you. We can discuss any concerns you have, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Would you like me to explain the steps involved?
PATIENT: Explain? Well… I suppose. I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, but if you have to… What exactly will you be doin’? And will it hurt? And will anyone else be in the room? I don't like people watchin’. Always busy, you know. Gotta protect my privacy. I don’t need everyone knowin’ my business. Just tell me exactly what happens, so I know what I’m gettin’ into. And make it quick, please. I have things to do. Really important things.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, you’ll lie down on the exam table, and I’ll drape you with a sheet to maintain your privacy. I’ll gently examine your abdomen. Then, I'll ask you to bend your knees and relax while I do a brief external examination of the pelvic area. I won't be doing anything internal today, just a quick look. It shouldn't be painful, but you may feel some pressure. I will be the only one in the room during the exam, and I will explain everything before I do it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: External? Just lookin’? Not goin’ inside? Well… that’s… better. Still don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, but if you promise not to put anything inside… and you explain everything first… Alright. But quick now, please. I have things to do. Important things. And keep it covered, you hear? I don’t want anyone seein’… anythin’. It’s… private. Now, let’s get this over with. Where’s this table? And make it quick. Really quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Just lie down on your back, and I’ll get a sheet to drape you. We’ll take it slow, and I'll explain everything as we go. I'll be right back with the sheet. Don't hesitate to tell me if you're uncomfortable at any point. And just to clarify - you've noticed this leakage primarily when you're resting, and it's been happening for about a month?
PATIENT: Restin', yes. And it smells a little funny, but I bathe regular, you know. Like I said, old age. Things just start smellin' funny. And it’s wet, always wet. Makes things sticky. Now, hurry with the sheet. I'm gettin' cold lyin' here. And don't poke too much. I don’t like bein’ poked. Just look and see what's wrong and give me somethin’ to stop it. That’s all I want. Stop the leakin’. And hurry. Really hurry. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for anything unusual. Just breathe normally. Hmm… a little tenderness here. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! That hurts a little. Not bad, but… yes, there. It’s always been a little tender there, actually. Ever since the babies. You know, stretchin’ and… things. But it hasn’t bothered me much. Usually. This leakin’ makes it worse, I think. Is somethin’ wrong with my babies? Are they… hurtin’? I should've kept those babies closer. Now they’re hurtin’ me. Just look quick, please. And don't poke too much. Makes it hurt. Really hurt.
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Genard, your babies are not hurt. That tenderness is likely from the stretching during childbirth, as you said. It's very common. The leakage itself isn’t caused by the babies. I’m just checking to see if there’s any swelling or anything unusual. It doesn’t seem to be anything obvious. Now, can you bear down, like you’re trying to have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Bear down? Like… push? What for? What are you lookin’ for? I don’t like pushin’. Makes things worse, usually. And I don’t like talkin’ about… that. Makes me embarrassed. Are you gonna put somethin’ inside me now? You promised not to! Just tell me what’s wrong and give me somethin’ to stop the leakin’. I have important things to do. Really important things. I don't have time for pushin’ and pokin’ and… embarrassed talkin’. Just look quick and give me somethin’ to stop it. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I understand your discomfort. Based on what you've told me, and the brief examination, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the leakage without further investigation. It could be related to stress incontinence – a weakening of the muscles that support the bladder, which is common after childbirth. It could also be a urinary tract infection, though you don't have any symptoms of one. Or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a urine test to rule out an infection. And I would like to refer you to a urologist – a specialist in bladder problems – for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform some specialized tests to determine the exact cause of the leakage and recommend the best treatment option. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Urine test? And a… uro-what? More doctors? More pokin’ and proddin’? No, no, no. I don’t want more doctors. I just want it stopped. Can’t you just give me somethin’ to stop the leakin’? Some kind of pill? Some kind of tea? Anything? I don’t want to go to more doctors. I don’t want more tests. I just want it stopped. It’s embarrassin’, you know. Always busy, always rushin’, always gotta worry about… leakin’. Just give me somethin’ to stop it now. Please. Is that too much to ask? Just stop the leakin’.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your frustration, and I wish I could just give you a simple solution. But I can't prescribe medication without knowing the cause of the problem. Giving you something without a diagnosis could actually make things worse. There are medications that can help with incontinence, but they have side effects, and they're not suitable for everyone. That's why it's important to get a proper evaluation. I can write you a prescription for some absorbent pads to help manage the leakage in the meantime. And I strongly recommend you consider seeing the urologist. I can provide you with a referral, and their office can explain the testing process and answer any questions you have. I understand you're reluctant, but it's the best way to get a long-term solution. Would you at least be willing to think about it?
PATIENT: Pads? Like… diapers? Oh, goodness no. I’m not wearin’ diapers. I’m Chamorro, you know. We have dignity. No, no pads. And I don’t want to see another doctor. I’ll just… deal with it. Bathe regular, wear dark clothes, and hope for the best. It’s just a little leakin’, you know? It’s not the end of the world. I have important things to do. Really important things. I don’t have time for doctors and tests and… diapers. No, thank you. Just… forget it. I'm leavin’. Just… forget it. I'll just deal with it. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. As you wish. Here’s the prescription for the pads. If you change your mind about seeing the urologist, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I wish you all the best. Please take care. .
