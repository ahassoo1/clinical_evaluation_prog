DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes... that’s right. My hands shake. It's been… well, it's been a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. Everything gets a bit fuzzy these days, you know? Just wanted to get it checked out, if that makes sense. Don't want it getting worse.
DOCTOR: A tremor, alright. And you said it's been going on for a while… difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started. Okay. Can you describe the tremor to me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s mostly when I'm trying to do something. Like… holding a cup of coffee, or writing. It’s not constant, thankfully. More like… a little wobble. Gets harder to control the finer things, you know? Not a big shake, not like… parkinson's or anything. Just… irritating. Especially when I'm trying to eat. Makes a mess, sometimes. Is that helpful? I don't know what else to say.
DOCTOR: “Irritating” is a perfectly good description, Mr. Jezik. It’s helpful to know it’s action-related, and not present at rest. And you're wise to think about Parkinson's, but we don't need to jump to conclusions. Do you notice anything that makes it worse, besides doing things?
PATIENT: Worse… let me think. Stress, maybe? When I get flustered, it seems a bit… more pronounced. And… honestly, when I haven’t had enough sleep. Old age, probably. Everything’s a bit harder when you’re tired. I used to work at the water plant, you know. Long hours sometimes… that couldn’t have helped. But that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: So stress and lack of sleep seem to be contributing factors. And you mentioned working at the water plant… for how long were you employed there, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Thirty… thirty-five years, maybe? Something like that. Started right out of… well, I don't even remember where I started, honestly. A long time ago, though. It was a good job. Lots of responsibility, keeping things running smoothly. But… not relevant now, I suppose. It was before everything got so… complicated. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Jezik. We need to understand your history. Thirty-five years at the water plant… what sort of work did you do specifically?
PATIENT: Specific… Everything. Well, not everything. Started as a… a basic operator, checking levels, making sure the pumps were running. Then I moved up to maintenance, fixing things when they broke. Eventually, I was in charge of the whole system, making sure the water was clean and safe. Lots of chemicals, I remember that. Chlorine, and… other things. A lot of paperwork too, now that I think about it. But mostly just keeping the water flowing. Is that enough detail? My mind isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Chlorine, you said. Alright. Do you recall any specific incidents while working with those chemicals?
PATIENT: Incidents… Hmm. There was… one time, a small leak in a storage tank. Nothing major, we fixed it right away. And… another time, a pump malfunctioned and there was a bit of a spill. But nothing serious, Doctor. Nothing that anyone got hurt over, or anything like that. Just… occupational hazards, I suppose. It was a long time ago. I really can’t recall the specifics. It was all a bit… chaotic, sometimes. Do you need dates or something? I really couldn’t tell you.
DOCTOR: Dates aren't essential, Mr. Jezik. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let’s move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms besides the tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Not really. Maybe a little… tired more often than I used to be. But that's just old age, I figure. And my memory isn't the best, as you've noticed. Nothing else that I can think of. No dizziness, no pain… just the shaky hands. Is that all? I'm starting to get a bit… uncomfortable, if I'm honest. Can we wrap this up soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It will include checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It shouldn’t take long. Then, based on what we’ve discussed, I’ll make some recommendations. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Exam… oh. Well, I suppose so. As long as it's quick. I don't like being poked and prodded, if you don't mind. And if you find anything serious, please… just tell me straight. I don't want any beating around the bush. But yes, go ahead. Let’s get it over with. Hopefully it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please extend your arms, palms up. I’m going to check your reflexes. This will involve a quick tap to your tendons. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but shouldn't cause any lasting pain. And please relax your arms. Now, could you try to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Ow! A little warning next time, please? See? Shaky. Always shaky. I told you. It’s getting worse, I think. This is just… embarrassing, honestly. Can we just… skip the rest? I really don’t like this.
DOCTOR: I observed a noticeable tremor in both upper extremities, most pronounced during the finger-to-nose test. Coordination appears mildly impaired. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Based on your history and this brief exam, Mr. Jezik, it could be essential tremor, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities. Given your long-term exposure to chemicals at the water plant, and the progressive nature of the tremor, I recommend a neurological work-up, including blood tests to assess for any heavy metal toxicity. And perhaps an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I will write you a referral to Dr. Novak, a neurologist in the city. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Neurologist… MRI… toxicity… It’s all a bit much, Doctor. I just wanted someone to tell me what was wrong with my hands, not… all of this. Will it… will it help? All of these tests? I’m not sure I have the energy for all of this. I’m an old man. And frankly, I don’t have insurance. But… okay. If you think it’s best. Just… please don’t make me wait too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. Given your lack of insurance, I will contact Dr. Novak's office and see if they have any financial assistance programs available. As for the tests, they're important to get a clear diagnosis and determine the best course of action. It’s possible it is nothing serious, but we need to be certain. I will also provide you with a list of resources for affordable healthcare options in the area. Here is the referral to Dr. Novak, and this is the information for a low-cost lab where you can get the blood tests done. I want you to schedule these tests as soon as possible. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish?
