DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, though I can’t quite say how long. Everything feels… off balance, you see?
DOCTOR: "Off balance," alright. And when you say “a little while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s the tricky part. It feels like… several weeks, perhaps? Or maybe months? It all blurs together, truthfully. My husband… he passed away not too long ago, and things haven’t been very clear since then. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: I understand loss can be…disorienting. Still, we need to try and pinpoint this unsteadiness. Has it been constant these weeks, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I believe. Some days are better than others. Though even on the better days, there’s a… a wobble, if that makes sense? It’s not a sharp fall, just… a feeling that I need to hold onto something. It’s worse when I’m tired, I think. And when I’ve been working. But I work with… rotary drills, you see? It’s rather physical work. Perhaps that explains it?
DOCTOR: Rotary drills… right. So, physically demanding work, and it’s worse with fatigue. And you said it’s a “wobble”?
PATIENT: Yes, a wobble. It’s not like I suddenly collapse, Doctor. It’s more… a feeling that the floor isn't quite solid. Like being on a boat, perhaps? Though not as dramatic. I find myself reaching for things… counters, walls… just to steady myself. It’s quite embarrassing, to be honest. I don't want to seem… frail.
DOCTOR: "Embarrassing" is not a medical term, Ms. Snerling. We're trying to figure out what's happening here. Do you experience any dizziness with this wobble?
PATIENT: Dizziness… hmm. That’s a good question. Sometimes, yes. Not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like… a lightheadedness? A sort of… floating feeling? It’s fleeting, though. It comes and goes with the wobble, I suppose. It’s hard to separate the two. I apologize again for being so unclear. Everything feels… muddled.
DOCTOR: "Muddled," alright. Any ringing in your ears, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears…? No, I don’t believe so. I haven’t noticed anything like that. Though, to be fair, the drills are very loud. Perhaps I’ve just gotten used to a constant ringing? I don't know. It’s possible I’m not noticing it. Would that be… unusual? I’m sorry. I’m just trying to think of everything.
DOCTOR: It's… not entirely helpful to speculate. Do you have any problems with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… no, I don’t think so. I had my eyes checked a few years ago, and everything was fine. Though, sometimes things seem… blurry. But that could just be from being tired, or the lighting at work. It's very dusty there, you see. Everything is always covered in a fine layer of… well, everything. I suppose it's possible my vision has changed, but I haven't noticed anything drastic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Not severe ones, thankfully. More like a dull ache, usually across my forehead. They seem to come and go with the… with the stress, I suppose. Work can be quite stressful, and… well, everything else, too. It’s hard to say if they’re related to the unsteadiness, though. They just… happen. I take some over-the-counter pain relievers when they get bad. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: What pain relievers do you take, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… ibuprofen, usually. Or… sometimes acetaminophen. Whatever’s on sale, to be honest. I don't pay much attention to the names. Just something to take the edge off, you see. I don't take them very often, only when the headache is really bothering me. Perhaps a few times a week, at most? Is that… too much? I truly apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I'm not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: Right. And any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I had my gallbladder removed several years ago. But that was a long time ago, and I haven't had any trouble with it since. And… my husband, before he passed… he always said my blood pressure was a little high. But I never really paid much attention to it. He used to take it for me, but… since he’s gone, I haven’t had it checked. Is that important, Doctor? I'm truly trying to recall everything, but it’s all… a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at you, Ms. Snerling. Could you please step onto the table and stand for a moment?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here we are. Though, please excuse me if I wobble a bit. It’s worse when I’m nervous, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to check your balance. Can you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? It’s… difficult. I feel rather precarious. Please do be careful, I would hate to fall.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Ms. Snerling. I'm just checking your stability. Reduced stability, with a tendency to sway. Positive Romberg test. Mild difficulty maintaining balance with eyes closed. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is this alright? I feel… rather foolish. I’m sorry if I’m being a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s enough, Ms. Snerling. Please, sit back down. Wide-based gait, with diminished arm swing. Slight unsteadiness. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I apologize for being so clumsy. It’s just… a bit unsettling, feeling so off balance. I hope you can find something to help.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Blood pressure is 140/90. Your blood pressure is a little elevated.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad, Doctor? My husband always worried about my blood pressure, but I never understood why. He would say I needed to watch my salt intake, and… well, I suppose I didn't always listen. Is it related to the unsteadiness, do you think? I apologize for being so ignorant. I truly am trying to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Elevated blood pressure can contribute to dizziness and unsteadiness, yes. However, it doesn't explain everything. Given your symptoms and physical exam findings, I suspect this is a combination of factors. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And, I'm also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your balance.
PATIENT: Oh. A neurologist… that sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something to be worried about? The blood work… that's alright, I suppose. Anything to help figure out what's going on. My husband… he always said I worried too much. Perhaps that’s why I’m so unsteady. But what could it be, Doctor? Is it… my heart? Or… something else?
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it’s premature to speculate. We need to gather more information before we can determine the cause of your symptoms. The blood work will help rule out deficiencies or infections. The neurologist will assess your balance and coordination. It could be a number of things, including, but not limited to, inner ear issues, nerve problems, or even medication side effects. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I'll also send a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in balance disorders. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. Thank you. I suppose… I’ll do whatever you think is best. It’s just… a lot to take in. Dr. Sharma… I’ll make an appointment as soon as possible. Is there anything I should… avoid in the meantime? Or… anything I should be looking out for? I apologize for all the questions. I'm just… anxious.
