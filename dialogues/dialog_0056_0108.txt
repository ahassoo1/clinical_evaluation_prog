DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’, you know? Not like a cut or anything, just… comin’ up. It's not pleasant, to say the least. Happened a couple times now. Hope you got a minute, 'cause I don’t really have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bleeding from your stomach – that definitely needs to be checked out. And I appreciate you letting me know you're short on time; I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was… oh, about a week ago, maybe a little longer. Around the 25th of July, I reckon. I was havin’ a bit of trouble sleepin' that night, felt kinda queasy, then… well, you can imagine. It wasn’t a huge amount, mind you, but enough to worry a fella. Then it happened again yesterday. Worse this time. Not somethin' you wanna repeat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around July 25th, and a repeat yesterday that was worse. And you said it wasn't a large amount initially, but yesterday was more significant. Can you describe what the blood looked like?
PATIENT: Significant… yeah, that’s a good word. Looked like coffee grounds, mostly. Dark, kinda grainy. And it wasn’t… bright red, if you know what I mean. More like… old. Yesterday's… well, there was a bit of brighter red mixed in with it, which is why I bothered comin' in. Honestly, I thought it might just go away on its own, but… better safe than sorry, I suppose. Though, I ain’t one for doctors normally. Waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee grounds and then some brighter red yesterday – that’s important information. That suggests it might be coming from higher up in your digestive tract. Have you been having any other symptoms alongside the bleeding?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… I’ve been feelin’ kinda tired, yeah. More tired than usual, I mean. And a little… weak, I guess. Not enough to knock me off my feet, but definitely not feelin' myself. Appetite’s been off, too. Don't really want much to eat, and when I do, it doesn’t stay down for long. Just kinda sits there. And heartburn. Been gettin’ a bit of heartburn lately, worse when I lie down. Does that tell you anything, doc? Or are you just gonna ask more questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, difficulty keeping food down, and heartburn – that paints a clearer picture. The heartburn is particularly relevant. Have you noticed any pain in your abdomen, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, exactly. More like a discomfort. A kinda gnawing feeling, high up in my stomach. Comes and goes, you know? It's not sharp, nothin’ like a proper ache. Just… annoying. And it's worse after I eat, naturally. I've had a bit of indigestion, too. Lots of gas. I suppose that’s part of the discomfort, really. Honestly, I just thought it was somethin’ I ate. But, like I said, this bleedin’… that’s a different story. I don’t normally bother with indigestion. It's just…life.
DOCTOR: Okay, gnawing discomfort high up in your stomach, worse after eating, and some indigestion. No sharp pain, which is good. Do you take any medications regularly, Brad?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. I used to take somethin' for my blood pressure a few years back, but the doc took me off it. Said I was fine. Haven’t been on anythin' since. I avoid 'em if I can, honestly. Too many side effects, you know? I prefer to just… deal with things. I take a few vitamins now and then, but that’s about it. Just the basic stuff. Vitamin D, maybe some C. Nothin' serious. And I definitely don’t take anythin’ for heartburn or indigestion. Like I said, I just deal with it. Is this goin' somewhere, doc? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just some vitamins occasionally. That’s helpful to know. I understand you're short on time, and I will be as quick as possible. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your abdomen and feeling it, nothing invasive. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: sighs Look, I really don't like being poked and prodded. But… fine. Get it over with. Just… try not to take too long. And don't tell me everything that could be wrong, alright? I don't need a lecture on worst-case scenarios. Just tell me what you find, not what might be. Deal? I've had a long day, and frankly, I’m already feelin’ worse just bein’ here.
DOCTOR: Deal. Just a quick listen and feel. I promise to only tell you what I find, not speculate. Alright, Brad. Your abdomen is soft, no significant guarding. I do feel a little tenderness when I press here, in the upper part of your stomach. Your bowel sounds are normal. No obvious masses or distension. That doesn’t tell us everything, but it’s a start. Now, given your symptoms and what I’ve found, I think we need to run some tests. Specifically, a blood test to check your hemoglobin levels and a stool test to check for blood. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests… of course. Just what I needed. Fine. Hemoglobin… stool… whatever. Get it done. But I want the results quick. And I need to know what they're lookin' for. I don't trust doctors to just tell me "everything's fine" without explainin' what they actually checked. I want to know what you're lookin' for in those tests, doc. What exactly are you suspectin'? Don’t leave me in the dark. And can I at least get somethin' for the heartburn while I wait? It’s killin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. We'll get those tests ordered immediately. The hemoglobin test will tell us if you've lost a significant amount of blood from the bleeding. The stool test will confirm the presence of blood and help us determine where it's coming from. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions about what’s causing this. However, given your symptoms – the bleeding, the heartburn, the discomfort – we need to rule out a few possibilities, including gastritis, ulcers, or potentially something more serious like a bleeding diverticulum. That's why we're running these tests. As for the heartburn, I can prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor to help reduce the acid. It won't fix the underlying problem, but it should give you some relief while we wait for the results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Gastritis… ulcers… diverticulum… You're throwin' around a lot of fancy words, doc. Look, I don't understand half of that. All I know is my stomach’s bleedin', and I'm feelin' like dirt. If you need to poke around in there with a camera or somethin', just say so. I'd rather get it over with than sit around waitin' for tests that don’t tell me nothin'. And yeah, give me somethin' for the heartburn. Anything to get some relief. But don't expect me to be happy about it. I still think this is a waste of time. Just get the tests done, and let me know when they're ready. And no lectures, alright? I’ve had enough of those for one day. Just the results. That's all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I understand your frustration. No lectures, I promise. Just the results. I’ve ordered the tests. The lab should be able to process them relatively quickly. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now, and she'll give you instructions on how to collect a stool sample. Once the results are back, we'll discuss them and determine the next steps. If the bleeding continues or worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms – like dizziness, weakness, or black, tarry stools – please go to the emergency room immediately. And I will write you a prescription for Omeprazole for the heartburn. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And don't bother callin' unless you got somethin' concrete. I'm not interested in maybes or possibilities. Just facts. And I still think this whole thing is ridiculous. But fine. Do what you gotta do. Let me know when it's ready.
