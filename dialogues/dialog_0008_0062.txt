DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, though most folks just call me Rayshun. I'm here regarding a matter at my workplace. It concerns the requirements for wearing masks and other protective gear. It’s causing me some difficulty, and I was advised to seek an exemption, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rayshun. I understand. So this is related to your job and the need for a medical exemption for wearing masks and protective gear. Can you tell me more about the difficulties you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I work as a Protective Service Worker – mostly checking in on families and ensuring the safety of children. The masks, well, they make it hard to be understood. My voice gets muffled, and a lot of communication in my line of work relies on reading body language and tone – things that are harder when half my face is covered. Also, I’ve noticed it causes a bit of anxiety, feeling…contained, I suppose. It's not a panic, but it’s uncomfortable. I want to do my job well, and I worry the mask is hindering that.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for explaining that. So it sounds like the mask is impacting both your ability to communicate effectively and causing some anxiety, even if it's not severe. Let's get some more details. Have you noticed this anxiety worsen over time, or is it consistent from the start?
PATIENT: It was more pronounced at the beginning, Doctor, when everything was new. Now, it’s…a steady feeling. Not escalating, thankfully. It’s like a low hum of discomfort whenever I put it on. It doesn't prevent me from doing the work, but it requires extra effort to focus and remain calm, especially when dealing with sensitive situations. I’ve been trying different types of masks, hoping to find one that’s more comfortable, but they all seem to have the same effect.
DOCTOR: Okay, a steady discomfort despite trying different mask types. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, just to get a full picture. Do you have any pre-existing anxiety or mental health conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never been formally diagnosed with any anxiety or mental health conditions. I’ve always considered myself a pretty level-headed person. I grew up on the reservation, and we rely a lot on inner strength and community support. I’ve certainly faced challenges, but I’ve always managed them without needing professional help. This feeling with the mask is…new. It’s specifically tied to the mask, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any significant medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. I've been fortunate in that regard. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, a routine procedure, and I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’m generally very healthy. I try to maintain a good diet and stay active. I walk a lot. I’m on Medicare now, just as a standard thing, given my age, but I rarely utilize it. I’ve been pretty lucky with my health, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good information. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't take any medications regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's about it. I prefer natural remedies when possible. I drink a lot of herbal tea, and I try to get plenty of rest. I really try to avoid putting anything unnecessary into my body, if I can help it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any known allergies. I’ve eaten a wide variety of foods throughout my life, and I’ve never had a reaction. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. I’ve never had any issues with pollen, animals, or anything like that either. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything of that nature.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, just to clarify, you're experiencing anxiety and communication difficulties specifically when wearing a mask for work, and you don’t have a history of anxiety or other medical conditions. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That is perfectly correct. It's entirely linked to the mask and the requirements at work. Before this, I’ve never experienced anything like it. I can handle stressful situations, but the feeling of being…obscured, and the difficulty being understood, is what’s causing the problem. It doesn’t affect my daily life otherwise. I can go to the store, visit friends, everything is fine when the mask isn’t involved.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying physical causes that could be contributing to your discomfort. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need to rule out any other possibilities. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I believe in thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear, heart and lungs are good, oxygen saturation is excellent, and your neurological exam is normal. This suggests there isn’t a clear physical cause for your discomfort. It appears to be more related to the psychological impact of wearing the mask. Now, regarding the anxiety, it doesn’t sound severe enough to warrant immediate medication, but we can explore some strategies to help manage your discomfort. Have you considered talking to someone – a therapist or counselor – about these feelings?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to check those things. And no, I haven’t considered talking to a therapist or counselor, honestly. It’s not really something we do in my community. We tend to rely on family and each other for support. I’ve been discussing it with my sister, and she’s been very helpful, but I’m not sure that’s the same thing. What other strategies might be available? Perhaps something I could do on my own?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’ve already been utilizing a strong support system, which is excellent. Some things you can try on your own include deep breathing exercises to help manage anxiety when you’re wearing the mask. There are many guided meditation apps available as well that can help with relaxation. Also, practicing mindful awareness – focusing on the present moment – can help reduce feelings of being contained. We can also discuss the possibility of a referral to a psychologist specializing in anxiety, if you'd like. They could provide you with some additional coping mechanisms and techniques. Before we go further, would you be open to exploring different mask types again?
PATIENT: Those sound like good suggestions, Doctor. I appreciate you offering them. I’m hesitant about the psychologist at this point, but I’m willing to try the breathing exercises and mindful awareness. I’ll look into those apps tonight. As for the masks, I have tried several, but they all seem to cause the same issue. I suppose I could try a different style – maybe one that fits looser or has a different material. But honestly, I’m not optimistic. Would it be possible to document my difficulties and perhaps obtain a letter for my workplace stating my concerns, even without a formal exemption? It might help them understand the situation.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can certainly document your difficulties and I can write a letter to your workplace outlining your concerns, the impact the mask is having on your ability to perform your duties, and the strategies we discussed to manage your discomfort. A formal exemption requires a more in-depth assessment and often involves ruling out underlying medical conditions that could be exacerbated by mask-wearing, which, based on our exam, doesn’t seem to be the case here. But a letter explaining the situation and your efforts to mitigate the problem should be helpful. So, to summarize, you're experiencing anxiety and communication difficulties related to mask-wearing for your job as a Protective Service Worker. You have no prior history of anxiety or mental health conditions, a normal physical exam, and we've discussed strategies such as deep breathing exercises and mindful awareness. We'll document these findings and I'll write a letter to your employer outlining your concerns. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfect. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and offer practical solutions. And I’m grateful for the letter. It’s not about avoiding my responsibilities, it's about being able to perform them effectively. I believe a clear explanation will help my workplace understand the situation. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better having discussed this with you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshun. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the letter ready for you within 24 hours. Please don't hesitate to reach out if your symptoms worsen or if you have any further concerns. Here's a pamphlet on deep breathing exercises to get you started. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, sir, that is all. The pamphlet is greatly appreciated. Thank you again for your time and assistance, Doctor Cumper. I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshun. I wish you a good day as well. Take care, and feel free to reach out if you need anything in the future.
