DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is... a pleasure. Well, it’s... difficult to explain. I find... words. They do not come so easy now. It is... frustrating, yes? I hope you can... help.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sherrell. It can be frustrating when it’s hard to find the right words. Don’t worry, we’ll take our time. Can you tell me, when did you first notice this difficulty with… expressing yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is... a good question. It was... some time ago. Not recently, but… not a long, long time either. Perhaps... six months? Maybe more? It comes and goes, you see. Some days... better. Some days… worse. I… do not remember exactly. It is… difficult to pinpoint, yes?
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And would you say it's a gradual change, or did it feel more sudden at some point?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Yes. It was... slow. Like… a fog. Coming in… little by little. Not… bang! Gone. No. Just… harder. To… say things. To find the… right… how do you say? The… labels for things. It is… strange. I hope that makes sense? It is difficult to… describe, yes.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Sherrell. You're describing it perfectly well. And it sounds… unsettling, to have words feel like they’re slipping away. Do you notice this difficulty affecting anything specific?
PATIENT: Yes… it is unsettling. Very. And… hmm. Conversations, of course. Talking with… friends. Remembering… names. Sometimes, I know who they are, but… the name… it is gone. And… work. I work with… numbers and… benefits. It requires… clarity. And… sometimes… the words for the… regulations… they escape me. It slows me down. It is… frustrating, yes. And… worrying. I do not want to… make mistakes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so affecting conversations, recall of names, and your work, specifically with regulations and clarity. That’s helpful to know. Do you find it’s more difficult to understand what others are saying, or is it more about expressing yourself?
PATIENT: Expressing, I think. Definitely expressing. I… hear things. I understand… mostly. Sometimes… fast talkers… difficult. But… mostly… I hear. The… problem is… making the words. To… say what I… think. To… answer questions. To… explain things. It is… more about… getting the ideas… out. Not… taking them in. Does that… make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sherrell. It sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty with what we call expressive aphasia. Now, that’s a broad term, and there are many reasons why someone might experience that. To help me narrow it down, have you had any recent head injuries, strokes, or illnesses?
PATIENT: Head injuries… no. Not… recently. A small fall… last year. But… nothing serious. A stroke… no. I do not think so. And… illnesses? I had… a cold, perhaps, in the winter. A small cough. But… nothing major. I… take medication for… blood pressure. That is all. I do not… remember anything else that would… cause this. It just… started, as I said. A slow… fog. Is this… bad, Doctor? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't had any recent head injuries or strokes. A cold wouldn’t typically cause this. The blood pressure medication is good to know, we'll look into that as well. It's understandable to be worried, Sherrell, and it's good you’re asking. It's difficult to say how serious it is at this stage without doing some further investigation. To get a better idea of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam. Just some simple tests to check your reflexes, coordination, and speech. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… alright. If you think it is… necessary. I… trust your judgment, Doctor. Tests… are fine. I just… hope they are not… too unpleasant. I do not… like surprises. Just… tell me what you are going to do… beforehand, yes?
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. I’ll explain everything before I do it, and we can take things at your pace. It's nothing painful or invasive, I promise. We’ll start with some basic questions, then I’ll ask you to repeat a few phrases, and finally, I'll check your reflexes and coordination. First, let's just talk a bit more about your daily routine. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live… alone. My wife… passed away… five years ago. A long time. I have… a daughter. She lives… in another city. About… two hours away. She visits… sometimes. And… a few friends. We… meet for coffee. Small talk. Nothing… important. It is… quiet, mostly. I keep… busy. With… work. And… reading.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Sherrell. It sounds like you have a good support system, even if it's small. That's good. And it’s wonderful that you keep busy with work and reading. Now, let’s move on to the speech portion of the exam. I’m going to ask you to repeat some simple phrases after me. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes… ready. I… will try my best. Please… speak slowly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No rush at all. Let's start with something simple. Repeat after me: “No ifs, ands, or buts.”
PATIENT: “No… ifs… ands… or… buts.” Is that… correct, Doctor? It feels… strange to say.
DOCTOR: That was perfectly fine, Sherrell. A little hesitant, but perfectly understandable. Let's try another one. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
PATIENT: “The… quick… brown… fox… jumps… over… the… lazy… dog.” That was… difficult. The words… tangled. Is… everything alright, Doctor? I am… struggling.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Sherrell. It’s good you’re telling me this. You are struggling, and that’s important information. You're doing very well just by being open and honest with me. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination, just simple tests with your hands and feet. But, based on what I've seen so far, and given the gradual onset and your history, I think it’s important to get a more detailed evaluation. I’d like to refer you to a neurologist. They specialize in the brain and nervous system and can do a more thorough assessment to determine the cause of your speech difficulties. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes. That sounds… wise. If you think it is… necessary, Doctor, then… yes. Please. I just want to… understand. To know… what is happening. I do not want this… to get worse. Perhaps… they can help. Thank you, Doctor. For… listening. And for… not dismissing me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It's my job to listen and to help you get the care you need. It’s good you’re seeking answers. I’ll get the referral process started right away. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’d like to avoid any strenuous mental activity, if possible, and try to get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. You have… explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Rest… yes. That sounds… good. Thank you again… for your kindness. And for your patience. I was… worried I would not be taken seriously. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. And you absolutely were taken seriously. It's always best to advocate for your health, and you did just that. Please, don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns that arise before your neurology appointment. I'll have the referral paperwork ready for you before you leave. Take care of yourself, and please, try not to worry too much. .
