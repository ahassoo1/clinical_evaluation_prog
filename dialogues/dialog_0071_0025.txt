DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Laury is good. I… I want to know more about where my people come from. I hear you can do tests… DNA tests? To see… ancestors, yeah? I want to know more about that.
DOCTOR: Ancestry tests… right. Yes, we can discuss those, Laury. Though, truthfully, it’s not something I specialize in directly. It's… a bit outside my usual Internal Medicine work. But we can certainly explore it. Before we jump into testing, could you tell me a little more about why now?
PATIENT: Why now…? Well, I’m getting old, Doctor. Eighty-five years old! And… I never really asked before. My parents, they didn't talk much about… before the islands, you know? Just always on the islands. I want to know… where we were before that. For my… for my memories, I guess. Before they are all gone. It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Laury. It's perfectly natural to want to connect with your roots, especially as time goes on. It's good you're thinking about this now. So, to be clear, you're interested in learning about your ancestral origins through genetic testing?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Genetic… the DNA test. To see… where my people started. Is it… is it hard? Does it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t hurt, Laury. It’s a very simple test. Usually just a swab inside your cheek – like using a Q-tip. No needles involved at all. We send it off to a lab, and they analyze your DNA. Now, it's important to know the tests aren't always definitive. They can give you a general idea of your ethnic origins, but it’s not like finding a family tree with exact names and dates. It’s… more about percentages and probabilities. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed with a swab, just in case?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not really. I can’t eat shellfish, makes me sick, but that’s it. Nothing with the… the swabs, I don’t think. I never used anything like that before. What kind of… percentages are we talking about? Like, will it tell me how much I am… Marshallese? And how much… other?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. It can give you a percentage breakdown, yes. For example, it might say something like "75% Polynesian," "15% East Asian," and so on. The accuracy depends on the lab and the databases they use. Marshallese ancestry may fall under Polynesian, but it can also be quite specific. We use a lab called… …Ancestry Insights. They have a fairly good reputation, and they’re fairly comprehensive. It’s not a perfect science, though, and there’s always a margin of error. It's more about broad regions than pinpointing exact tribal origins. Before we get started with the swab, let’s quickly go through your medical history, just as a standard precaution. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… Just old age, Doctor. My knees are bad. And my heart… it sometimes feels funny. But I take pills for that. Doctor Miller gives them to me. He's a good doctor. I see him every three months. He says my blood pressure is… up sometimes. But the pills help. I don’t remember the names of the pills. Sorry. I take a lot of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees, heart… and blood pressure, managed with medication. It’s alright you don’t remember the names, Laury. We can look those up in Dr. Miller’s records. Do you mind if I take a quick look at your EHR now?
PATIENT: EHR? What's that? Is that more tests? I don’t want more tests. I just want to know about my ancestors. The DNA test. Is this going to take long? My grandson promised to take me for ice cream later.
DOCTOR: No, no more tests right now, Laury. EHR just stands for Electronic Health Record. It’s like… a computer file with all your medical information – what Dr. Miller has told me about your conditions and medications. It’s just a quick way for me to get a better picture of your health, so I can make sure the DNA test is safe for you. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Alright… let’s see… Laury Scobie, date of birth… Okay, here we are. I see you're currently taking Lisinopril for high blood pressure, and… Simvastatin for cholesterol. And yes, Dr. Miller notes some knee osteoarthritis. And… a history of mild heart palpitations. Are those palpitations still happening?
PATIENT: Palpitations…? Sometimes. Not so much lately. Maybe once a month. Just a flutter, you know? Like a little bird in my chest. It doesn’t last long. It doesn’t bother me too much. But… the pills help. Doctor Miller says it's just my age. He says I'm a strong old man. So, about the DNA test…? Will it tell me if I have any… kings in my family? My mother always said we had chiefs, but she never said anything about kings.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations occasional, managed with medication. That’s helpful to know. And as for kings… the DNA test won’t specifically tell you if you have royal lineage, Laury. It’s more about ethnic and geographical origins. However, it could potentially reveal connections to populations that historically had royal or chieftain families. It's a long shot, but… possible. Before we proceed, just one more quick question: do you have any known allergies to latex or any other materials that might be in the swab?
PATIENT: Latex…? Hmm… I don't think so. Never used it. I used to work with wood. Lots of wood. But no latex. My hands are rough, you know? From the wood. But no allergies. I don't think. I've never had a reaction to anything. Except the shellfish, of course. That makes me very sick. But no latex. We can do the swab, I think. I want to know about my ancestors. I want to know where I come from. Is it time now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Laury. It is time. Just open your mouth wide, and I'll gently collect a sample from the inside of your cheek. It shouldn’t take more than a few seconds. There we go. All done. Now, we'll send this off to Ancestry Insights. It usually takes about two to three weeks to get the results. They’ll send them to you directly, and we can review them together when they arrive. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Two or three weeks… I can wait. Thank you. I hope it tells me something… something good. About my people. About my ancestors. Maybe a king or a chief… That would be nice. Now… can we go get that ice cream? My grandson is probably waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Laury. I hope it brings you the information you're looking for. And yes, you absolutely should go enjoy that ice cream with your grandson. Here’s a form with some details about the test and how to access the results online. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions at all. It was a pleasure meeting you, Laury. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your ice cream!
