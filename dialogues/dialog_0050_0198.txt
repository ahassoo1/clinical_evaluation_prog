DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been…thinking lately about trying mindfulness or meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a bit hectic sometimes, even though my job isn’t that stressful. I just feel like I could use a little…centering, I suppose. I’m not sure where to start, really.
DOCTOR: I see. While I appreciate you seeking ways to improve your well-being, Ms. Sugino, this office is dedicated to addressing medical concerns. Mindfulness and meditation, while potentially beneficial, fall outside the scope of my practice. However, to be thorough, and to ensure there isn’t an underlying condition contributing to these feelings of… “hecticness,” as you put it, let’s discuss your general health. Have you experienced any specific physical symptoms alongside this feeling—fatigue, changes in sleep or appetite, perhaps any unexplained pain?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand completely, Doctor. You’re right to ask. I probably should have explained better. It’s not a medical problem, not exactly. I just… thought a doctor might have resources or recommendations. And…well, actually, yes. I have been a bit more tired lately, more so than usual after work. And my appetite…it’s been up and down, not really consistent. No pain, though, thankfully. Sleep is…okay. I wake up a few times a night, but nothing terrible. Mostly just thinking. Does that make sense? I apologize, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Sugino. It's helpful to have a more complete picture. Fatigue and fluctuating appetite can be indicative of several underlying issues, even if they seem minor. To proceed systematically, let’s review your medical history. Firstly, do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, my thyroid has been checked a couple of times, and it was fine. My mother had high blood pressure, but I haven’t had any issues with that myself, so far. I get a check-up every year with my primary care doctor, and everything is usually good. I do have Medicare, so they’re pretty thorough, I think.
DOCTOR: Very good. And have you had any surgical procedures performed at any point in your life?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I've been lucky enough to avoid surgery so far. Just the usual things – vaccinations, dentist visits…nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but it healed perfectly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s move on to your family history, then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, stroke, dementia, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, my mother had high blood pressure. My father…he had a stroke a few years before he passed away. It was sudden, very sad. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had…I believe it was Alzheimer’s. It was a long time ago, so I don't remember all the details, but it was definitely some form of dementia. And, um… my aunt, my mother’s sister, was diagnosed with breast cancer about ten years ago. She’s doing okay now, thankfully. She had treatment and seems to be in remission.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for that information, Ms. Sugino. That is… pertinent. Now, briefly, could you describe your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone, I’ve been single for a long time. I don't have any children. I work as a signal and track switch repairer for the railroad, as you know. It’s a good job, mostly outdoors. I enjoy it. I have a few friends, we see each other occasionally, but I don’t have a large social circle. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. I try to eat healthy, but… as I mentioned, my appetite has been off lately. I don't have any pets. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay as natural as possible. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. I don't take any vitamins or supplements regularly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Sugino, I believe a brief physical examination is warranted, despite your initial presentation. It will allow me to assess your overall health and rule out any obvious underlying causes for your fatigue and fluctuating appetite. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever is needed to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would please have a seat on the examination table, we'll begin with your vital signs. I’ll be listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure and pulse. Please undress to the waist and put on a gown. I’ll return shortly.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let’s begin. Please lie back. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take deep, slow breaths. Heart sounds are regular, S1 and S2 normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly palpated. Patient appears mildly fatigued, but otherwise in no acute distress. Skin is warm and dry. No obvious signs of underlying medical condition.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is everything alright? It doesn’t feel like anything is wrong, but… you’re the expert, of course. I just get a little anxious sometimes when things are poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: The physical examination, while not revealing any acute abnormalities, does not entirely rule out the possibility of an underlying issue. Your fatigue and fluctuating appetite, combined with your family history of stroke and dementia, warrant further investigation. I recommend we order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. These tests will provide valuable information about your overall health and help us determine if there is an underlying medical cause for your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then absolutely. I trust your judgment. It's better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. I’m a little worried now, to be honest, about the family history… but I appreciate you taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’ll submit the orders to the lab immediately. You’ll receive a call within 24-48 hours to schedule a blood draw. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, ensuring adequate hydration, and prioritizing sufficient sleep. Avoid any strenuous activities that may exacerbate your fatigue. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… what kind of things would the tests look for, if you don’t mind me asking? I’m not a medical person, so I don't understand all the terminology.
DOCTOR: The comprehensive metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood glucose levels. Essentially, it provides a broad overview of your body’s chemical processes. The complete blood count will evaluate your red and white blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, and platelet count. This will help us identify any signs of anemia, infection, or other blood disorders. And the thyroid-stimulating hormone level will determine if your thyroid gland is functioning properly. In essence, we’re looking for any subtle abnormalities that may be contributing to your fatigue and appetite changes. It’s a relatively routine procedure, Ms. Sugino, and I assure you, it’s better to identify any potential issues early on. Do you have any further questions before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That makes sense. Thank you for explaining it so well. I feel a little better knowing what to expect. I’ll schedule the blood draw as soon as I get the call. And…thank you for taking my concerns seriously, even though it’s not exactly a traditional medical problem. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Sugino. It is my professional obligation to thoroughly investigate any concerns you may have. While your initial presentation was… unconventional, your overall well-being is my priority. I will have my nurse provide you with instructions regarding the blood draw and a copy of today’s consultation notes. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to discussing the results with you at our follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
