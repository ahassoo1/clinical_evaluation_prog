DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to... how you say... find out more about where my family come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do test with... with spit? To know who we are, from before.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing, using a saliva sample. It can provide information about your ethnic origins, tracing your lineage back generations. It's a fascinating field. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little more about why you're interested in this now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Good question. Well… I get old, you know? Eighty-five year. I think a lot about… what stay when I gone. My son, he no ask about old stories much. And my people, Marshall Islands… we move around a lot. Lost some things, you know? I want to know… for me. And maybe… for him, later. If he want. I just want to know where my family really come from, before the islands.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable feeling, Mr. Scobie. It’s wonderful that you’re thinking about preserving your family history. Knowing your roots can be very important. So, you're interested in exploring your ancestry for personal reasons, and potentially for your son. Okay. To be clear, these tests don't tell us everything about your past, but they can provide a good starting point. They work by analyzing your DNA and comparing it to reference populations. Do you have any concerns about the test itself, or about what the results might show?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really. I trust you, Doctor. I just… I no understand how it work exactly. You take my spit, then what happen? And… what if it tell me things I no want to hear? Maybe family not from where I think? It okay to be scared a little, right?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be a little apprehensive, Mr. Scobie. That’s a very reasonable feeling. It's good to ask questions. Essentially, we'll collect a saliva sample – it’s a very simple process, just spitting into a tube. That sample is then sent to a laboratory where they analyze your DNA. They compare your DNA markers to those of people from different regions around the world. The results will give you an estimate of your ethnic origins – percentages representing the likely regions your ancestors came from. It's important to remember that it's an estimate, and the further back you go, the less precise it becomes. And yes, it’s possible the results might be unexpected. It doesn’t change who you are, or your family’s history as you know it, but it might offer some new insights. We can discuss the results together, and I can help you interpret them. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that make more sense. Spit in tube, they look at it, then tell me… how much from here, how much from there. Like… a map in my body? And you say estimate. So not sure, not like… 100% true? That okay. I not need 100%. Just… a little help to understand. What happen if… what if it show I got family from… China, maybe? My people no go to China. Would that mean… something wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Scobie. “A map in your body” is a lovely way to put it, yes. Essentially, that's what it's trying to do. And you're right to ask about the accuracy. It's not a perfect science. There's always a margin of error, and the results depend on the databases they use for comparison. Also, populations move and mix over time, which can make things complex. If the test did show ancestry from China, it wouldn’t necessarily mean something is “wrong”. It could mean a distant ancestor migrated through China, or had ancestors who came from that region long ago. It could also be due to limitations in the database. The Marshall Islands have a rich history of trade and interaction with other cultures. Sometimes, unexpected results can simply highlight the complexity of human migration patterns. We would explore those possibilities together. Before we proceed, let's quickly review your medical history. Just to ensure there aren’t any contraindications to providing a saliva sample, or any other concerns. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. A little itchy sometimes from sun, but nothing big. I take medicine for my water, you know? Old man problem. And… my heart, it beat a little fast sometimes. But I see the doctor, he give me pill. That all. I think. Nothing stop me from spit in tube, I promise! I strong man, for eighty-five. Just… a little slow now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Scobie. “Old man problem” is a perfectly acceptable explanation! It’s helpful to know about the medication for your water and your heart. We just want to be thorough. So, you take medication for benign prostatic hyperplasia – difficulty with urination – and for some episodes of rapid heartbeat, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that right. Water and heart. The doctor say old man things. He good doctor. He know I like to fish, he no tell me stop. That important. No, he not stop me fish. He just want me take the pills. And… watch the salt. I try. But salt make the fish taste good! You think… the pills stop the spit test? I no want to stop the test. I really want to know about my family.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Scobie, and it’s important to consider potential interactions. Some medications can affect the results of genetic testing, although it’s not common. The medications you’re taking are less likely to interfere, but it’s still best to be cautious. To be absolutely sure, I’d like to check with a pharmacist to see if there are any known interactions. It's a quick call, and we can have an answer in a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that good. Check with the pharmacist. I happy you think about everything. I no want to waste the spit if the pills stop it. And I no want to tell my son I waste my spit! He laugh at me if I do that. He good son, but he tease me sometimes. That okay. I tease him back. He like the fishing too, now. I teach him everything. Check with the pharmacist, please. I wait. No hurry. I got all the time in the world, now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. One moment, please. "Hi, Sarah?
