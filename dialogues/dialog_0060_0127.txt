DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it's been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’re drooping, you see. It’s not sudden, it’s been happening gradually over the last few months, but it’s definitely getting more noticeable. It makes me feel… tired, even when I’ve slept.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Weakness and drooping eyelids… gradually worsening over months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started, I think, with just feeling a little more tired than usual after work. Like I couldn’t quite get my energy back, even with a full night’s sleep. Then I noticed it was harder to… lift my eyelids fully in the morning. And now… well, I worry people think I’m just sleepy all the time. It’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I work in facilities management, so I need to be alert.
DOCTOR: Right. Facilities management… that requires quite a bit of focus, doesn't it?
PATIENT: It does, yes. A lot of problem-solving, and being on my feet quite a bit. That’s part of why I’m concerned. It’s getting harder to do things that used to be easy. Like, carrying equipment, or even just… concentrating for long periods. I’m divorced, and I live alone, so there isn’t anyone to really notice these things until it gets… obvious, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue, worsening eyelid drooping, difficulty with tasks requiring concentration or physical exertion… and you live alone. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… not really, not that I’ve consciously noticed. Everything seems clear enough. Although, now that you mention it, sometimes things seem… a bit blurry at the edges of my vision, but I just put that down to needing new glasses. I haven't had my eyes checked in a while, to be honest. It’s been a bit of a stressful year, and things like that slipped my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any muscle weakness anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yes… actually, yes. It's hard to explain. My arms feel… heavy sometimes. Like when I'm lifting things, or even just holding them up for a while. And I think my legs get tired more quickly than they used to. Not like a burning sensation, just… weak. It’s all very gradual, you see? It’s not like I suddenly can’t walk or anything. Just… less strength. It makes me stumble a little sometimes, but I haven't fallen yet.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heavy arms, fatigue in legs, some stumbling… Hmm. Now, let's go through some other things. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. I still eat about the same amount. Maybe I don’t feel like cooking as much, so I’ve been getting takeaways more often than I used to. But I’m not losing my appetite, if that makes sense. I still enjoy my food, just… less motivated to prepare it, perhaps. It’s a bit silly, really, but it’s been a bit of everything adding up, you see? The tiredness, the weakness, the feeling generally run down... it doesn't make for a very enthusiastic cook.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant appetite changes, just less motivation for cooking. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… no, I don’t think so. Not that I've noticed. And my voice… no changes either. People haven't mentioned anything, and I haven't noticed it sounding any different myself. I do get a bit… breathless sometimes, after a lot of physical activity, but I’ve always been a bit out of breath easily, to be honest. I don't smoke, and I try to be reasonably healthy, but I'm not an athlete or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. No difficulty swallowing, no voice changes, occasional breathlessness with activity. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, playing football, but that was it. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything chronic, or anything that required ongoing treatment. I’m not on any medications at all, and I haven’t had any surgeries. It’s just… this is all quite new, you see? That’s why I’m worried. I’m usually a very healthy person.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chronic medical conditions, no surgeries, no medications. And have you had any recent infections or illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had a bad cold about six months ago, but nothing particularly serious. Just the usual sniffles, cough, sore throat. It lasted about a week, and I recovered fully. I haven’t been sick since then. Nothing that would explain all this, I wouldn't think. It just felt like a normal cold. I didn't go to the doctor for it, honestly. I usually just rest and drink lots of fluids.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent serious illnesses, just a cold six months ago. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times for minor infections, and painkillers for headaches, but nothing significant. And I don’t have any food allergies either. I eat pretty much everything. I'm not particularly sensitive to anything, honestly. It's another reason why this is all so… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And finally, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had some problems with her muscles when she was older. Not when she was young, but in her seventies, she started getting weaker, and she had some trouble with swallowing. The doctors said it was something to do with her nerves, but I don’t remember the exact name of it. She passed away a few years ago now. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never a day's illness in his life, as far as I know. And I don't have any siblings, so it’s mostly just my mother's side of the family that I know much about. It’s… not a very helpful history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother had muscle weakness later in life, father was healthy. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your muscles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I'm hoping you can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you just let your arms fall loose?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? I'm not very good at relaxing, though, if I’m honest. I tend to tense up a bit. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other side… Hmm. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Is that enough? It doesn’t feel as strong as it used to be, honestly. It’s hard to explain, but it feels… weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other hand... Hmm. Your grip strength is noticeably weaker on both sides, but more pronounced on this side. Now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hands. Can you push as hard as you can, please?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… difficult. It feels like I’m trying to push through something heavy. It’s not as strong as it should be, Doctor. Honestly, I’m starting to worry a bit. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other arm… Hmm. Your arm strength is also diminished on this side, and again, more pronounced. Now, let’s check your legs. Can you lift your legs, one at a time, while I hold them down?
PATIENT: Alright, I’ll try my best. It feels a bit silly, lying here like this, but… Like this? It's… harder than it should be. It feels heavy, and I’m getting tired already.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other leg... Hmm. Your leg strength is also diminished on this side, and again, more pronounced. Now, let me just take a look at your eyelids again… Yes, they are noticeably drooping. It’s called ptosis. Based on what I’ve observed during the examination – the weakness in your arms and legs, diminished reflexes, drooping eyelids, and the more pronounced weakness on one side – I suspect you may have a condition affecting your nerves and muscles. However, to confirm this, we need to run some tests. I’d like to order a blood test to check for certain antibodies and inflammation markers, and an electromyography to assess the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Nerves and muscles… blood tests and… an EMG? I… I think so. So, it’s something… serious? Is it treatable? I don't understand what an EMG is, if you don't mind me asking. It sounds a bit… frightening. And what kind of antibodies are you looking for? I'm sorry, I'm just a bit overwhelmed. This is all very new to me.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, Gedalya. It’s good you’re asking questions. An EMG is a test where we insert a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It doesn't hurt much, it’s a bit like a pinch. It helps us pinpoint exactly which nerves and muscles are affected. As for the antibodies, we’re looking for signs of an autoimmune condition, where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues. There are several possibilities, and the blood test will help us narrow down the cause. It could be serious, but it’s important to remember we don’t have a diagnosis yet. Many of these conditions are treatable, especially if we catch them early. We'll start with the tests, and then we can discuss the results and develop a plan. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood test and the EMG. The EMG will need to be done by a specialist, so I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist. Would you like me to explain any of that again, or do you feel comfortable with these next steps?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Blood tests… neurologist… EMG… to check for something attacking my muscles. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I feel any worse while we’re waiting? I have a job, you see. I need to be able to work. And… I live alone. It’s worrying, thinking about all this.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Gedalya. The blood test results usually take about a week to come back. The EMG appointment may take a few weeks to schedule, and the results from that will take another week or so. As for feeling worse, it’s difficult to say. Some people experience a gradual worsening of symptoms, while others remain stable. It’s important to monitor yourself closely and let me know immediately if you notice any new or worsening symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking. I'll also give you a handout with information about these conditions, and a list of support groups in the area. It can be helpful to talk to others who are going through the same thing. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results once they come in. In the meantime, please try not to stress too much. We're going to figure this out. Do you have any questions about the referrals, or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Nooruddin. You’ve been very helpful, explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and not dismissing my concerns. It’s… it’s a relief to have a plan, even if it’s a bit frightening. I'll schedule those appointments as soon as I can. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll see you in two weeks. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you in two weeks. .
