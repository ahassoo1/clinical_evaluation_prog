DOCTOR: Right, Candis Hardenburgh. 79 years old… Look, I'm Dr. Ruocco. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this tiredness. Just constant tiredness. And… well, it’s embarrassing to even say, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to where I figured I should probably get it checked out. Don’t look at me like that, young man. It’s not… a choice.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt. Yes. Right. Well, that’s… unusual. And the tiredness… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the tiredness started… maybe six months ago? Slowly, you know? Just got worse and worse. At first I thought it was just getting old. But then… the dirt started. Maybe three months ago? It’s the red clay from behind my house, mostly. Don’t tell me you think I’m crazy. It tastes… earthy. Not good, but… it helps a little. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Helps a little?
PATIENT: Yes, helps. Like… it takes the edge off. A little bit. I can’t explain it. It’s not like it cures anything, but when I feel really weak, a little bit of clay… it just… settles my stomach, I guess. I don't know! I'm an old woman, not a doctor. And honestly, I haven’t been feeling myself lately, so maybe my explanations aren't very good. Are you going to tell me to stop? Because it's not like I want to be eating dirt, you know.
DOCTOR: So, you’re experiencing fatigue for six months, and pica – that's the craving and eating of non-nutritive substances – for three months. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Ugh, "pica". Fancy words for something silly. No, just the clay. Though… now that you mention it, I have been wanting ice. A lot of ice. But everyone wants ice in the summer, don't they? And I’ve always had a sweet tooth. It’s not like I’m chewing on rocks or anything. Just ice and the dirt. And I really don’t see what the big deal is, frankly. I've lived a long life. Maybe I'm just… wearing out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I try to stay away from those things if I can help it. Give me a little ginger tea before I start popping pills. I have a bit of arthritis, but I just deal with it. A little pain is just part of getting old, you know? Besides, I can’t afford medications, anyway. No insurance. Don’t even get me started on that mess. So, no, nothing. Just me, a little dirt, and a whole lot of tiredness. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Errands. Right. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen… and I’ll take a look at your hands. It’s just a formality, really. Just to rule things out. Don't worry, it won’t take long.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I don’t see what poking and prodding is going to do, but if you insist. I haven’t had a doctor poke around in years. Honestly, I’m probably tougher than I look. Just… try not to take too long, alright? My garden needs weeding.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Abdomen… soft, non-tender. Your hands… a little swollen, some redness around the knuckles. I'm noting some mild pallor in your nail beds as well. Noted pallor, mild edema, and redness in hands. Blood pressure is a little low, 110/70.
PATIENT: Low blood pressure? That explains why I've been feeling dizzy sometimes. Honestly, it's just one thing after another these days. Look, are you going to tell me what’s wrong with me, or are you just going to keep writing things down? I’m not a doctor, I don’t understand all this… pallor and edema. Is it serious? Just tell me straight, alright? I don’t need coddling, just the truth.
DOCTOR: Look, you're an older woman with a history of fatigue and... unusual dietary habits. The low blood pressure and pallor suggest possible anemia. The dirt eating could be contributing to nutrient deficiencies, or it could be a symptom of something else. To be honest, it's difficult to say without some blood work. I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll need to check your vitamin D and B12 levels as well. And I’ll write you a referral to a hematologist. They can take a better look at things.
PATIENT: Hematologist? Goodness. A specialist? Look, I just want to feel better, not be poked and prodded by a bunch of fancy doctors. Is it expensive? I told you, no insurance. And what about the dirt? Are you going to tell me to stop immediately? Because honestly, it’s the only thing that’s been giving me any relief. Just tell me what I need to do, alright? Don’t bury me in medical jargon and referrals. It's a lot to take in, you know. And honestly, I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Look, the hematologist will determine the cause of the anemia and recommend treatment. As for the dirt… I strongly advise you to stop eating it. It's likely causing more harm than good. It can introduce bacteria and parasites, and it's not providing any nutritional benefit. I understand your financial concerns. I'll see if I can find a clinic that offers a sliding scale fee for the blood work and hematology consultation. As for now, try to increase your intake of iron-rich foods – leafy greens, red meat, beans. And drink plenty of water. Here. Take this to the lab. They'll draw some blood. And I'm writing a referral for Dr. Anya Sharma, a hematologist downtown. It's a start. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. .
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you say. Dr. Sharma, sliding scale… Honestly, it's a lot to keep track of. And you’re telling me to stop the dirt… it’s just… easier said than done. I guess I’ll try your… iron-rich foods. But don’t expect miracles. And frankly, I still think you’re overreacting. But whatever. I’ll go get the blood work done. Thank you, I suppose. Hematologist… honestly. .
