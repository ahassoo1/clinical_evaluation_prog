DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I’m here because, well, I’m starting to date someone, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up before… things progress. One simply doesn't want to be caught unawares, you understand. It’s a matter of responsibility, really.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of you, Esthela. It’s always a good idea to be proactive about your health, and I commend you for thinking ahead. So, just to be clear, you’re looking for a general check-up to ensure everything is healthy before becoming more intimate with a new partner?
PATIENT: Precisely. A “general check-up” is… putting it mildly. I want to be certain there are no… surprises. And frankly, I’d like a professional opinion on what one should be concerned about, if you follow. My mother always said a woman must be her own advocate, but even advocates need… guidance. It’s not something one discusses openly, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's not always easy to talk about these things, and your mother was very wise. I'm happy to provide that guidance and answer any questions you have. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had my tonsils out as a child, naturally. And a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia when I was in college. Nothing serious, mind you. I've always been… relatively healthy. Though I did have gestational diabetes with my son, but that resolved after the birth. Other than that… I’ve always been quite careful. Diet and exercise, you see. One mustn’t let oneself go. Are you recording all of this? It’s good to be thorough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am recording everything, Esthela. It’s important to have a complete picture. And that information about the gestational diabetes is good to know, thank you. Do you currently have any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, none of those, thankfully. My blood pressure is… remarkably stable, I’ve had it checked regularly. And as I said, no diabetes currently. I do watch my cholesterol; my husband is… fond of rich foods, and one must balance things, you see. I try to incorporate plenty of fiber into our diet. It’s a constant negotiation, really. He believes a good steak is a necessity, not a luxury. A rather… stubborn man, if I may say so. But a good provider.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re very mindful of your health, and navigating a household can certainly be a balancing act! And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a low-dose aspirin daily, as my father had a history of heart trouble. And I take a multivitamin, naturally. One must keep up one's strength. And, well, occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that's infrequent. I prefer to rest, if possible. I try to avoid medications whenever I can. All those side effects! It’s quite frightening, really, what they put in those pills. Do you feel those are all sufficient details? I wouldn’t want to omit anything.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Esthela. Aspirin, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. That's a helpful overview. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Not to medications, not to foods… nothing of that sort. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. My sister, on the other hand, is terribly allergic to shellfish, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though… I do find certain perfumes give me a headache. Is that considered an allergy? It’s a rather… delicate sensitivity, I suppose. It’s just… overwhelming. Strong scents, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the perfumes. While it’s not a typical allergy, it’s definitely something we should note, as sensitivities can be important. It suggests a potential sensitivity to strong chemicals. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother’s side… well, there’s a history of heart disease. Her father died quite young of a heart attack. And my aunt, on that side, had breast cancer. Thankfully, she’s in remission now. My father's side… less so. He was an only child, and his parents… well, they didn't discuss those things openly. Not very forthcoming people. So, it's difficult to say. Mostly, it's the heart disease and the breast cancer I’m aware of. It’s rather unsettling, isn’t it? One can only do so much, I suppose. It's not as if one can choose one's genetics.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about the heart disease and breast cancer in your family. You're right, you can't choose your genetics, but knowing the history allows us to be more proactive with your health. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not! Smoking is… appalling. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I find that question… rather impertinent, actually. My husband and I lead a very respectable life. We are members of the community, you see. I simply wouldn’t associate with such things. I trust you understand. A proper upbringing, you know. It makes all the difference.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I understand completely. Thank you for being so open. That’s very good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable. Though I must warn you, I do have a rather low tolerance for cold stethoscopes. My mother always said I was… delicate. But please, proceed. I would like to get this matter settled as quickly and efficiently as possible, if you don’t mind. The sooner I have a clean bill of health, the better. And perhaps a bit of warm gel for that stethoscope? It’s just a thought.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I can absolutely warm up the stethoscope for you. We’ll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration—and then do a quick listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also check your abdomen and do a basic neurological exam. Is it alright if I have you undress down to your examination gown, and I’ll provide a sheet for modesty?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly adequate. I suppose one must endure a bit of… exposure for the sake of good health. Though I do prefer a thicker examination gown, if you have one available. And a larger sheet, please. A lady must have some dignity, you understand. I trust this will be a swift process? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. We'll make this as quick and comfortable as possible. I have everything ready, and I assure you, this won't take long. Please, take your time getting changed, and let me know when you’re ready. I'll step just outside the room while you change, and I’ll be right back.
