DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Don't need long talk. Chest… feels funny. And heart… beats too fast sometimes. Blood pressure… wife say it high. She make me come here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Funny” in your chest and a fast heartbeat at times, and your wife has noticed your blood pressure seems high. We’ll definitely look into all of that. To start, can you tell me a bit more about what “funny” feels like in your chest?
PATIENT: Feels… tight. Like someone sitting on it. Not always. When I walk up hill… worse. Also… when I worry. My son… always trouble. Makes me stress. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Tightness in your chest, especially when walking uphill or when you're stressed about your son. That gives me a good starting point. Does this tightness radiate, or stay in one spot?
PATIENT: Radiate? What that mean? It just… hurts here. . Sometimes… goes to my arm. Left arm. But not always. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: “Radiate” just means does the pain spread anywhere else. And yes, the fact that it sometimes spreads to your left arm is important. We need to rule out a few things. Before we go further, have you ever had this pain diagnosed before, or have you seen a doctor for it previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. Doctors… waste of time. I work hard. No time for… sitting around. This is new. Wife… she keep telling me go to doctor. She worry too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your wife is encouraging you to get this checked out. Even if you haven’t had this pain before, it’s always best to investigate new symptoms. Okay. Let's talk a little about other things. Do you have any difficulty breathing, or shortness of breath, along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: No. I breathe. Like normal. Maybe… when I walk very fast uphill. Then I get… puff puff. But I always walk fast. Always have. Is that… normal for old man?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you experience some breathlessness with exertion, specifically walking fast uphill, but not at rest. And you're right, some shortness of breath with exertion can be normal with age. Now, let’s quickly go through a few other things to get a broader picture. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmph. I wear socks. Always wear socks. Maybe… a little bit. Sometimes after long day. But I stand a lot. Work. Emergency… things. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I meant. Some swelling after standing for a long time. That can be expected. Alright. Now, do you have any history of diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My father… strong man. Worked farm. Never sick. Mother… she cook good food. Not much problem. No… no sugar sickness. No… cholesterol. Heart… maybe some old uncle… but he drink too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant family history of diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems. That's good information. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… little pill for stomach. Sometimes upset. Wife buy it. From… store. Small white pill. That’s all. No other. I don't like taking pills. Weakens you.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a small white pill for your stomach occasionally. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, I think I have a good starting point. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Hurry. I have things to do. Emergency… things. Don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today—162 over 98. Your pulse is 88, and a little irregular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths. I’m hearing a slight murmur when I listen to your heart, and some mild crackles in your lungs. I would like to examine your ankles. Please place your feet flat on the floor. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Based on what you've told me, and what I've heard and seen so far, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. I would like to order some tests, including an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray, and some blood work to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and other important levels. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests? More time… waste of time. But… wife will be happy. She always say “go to doctor, go to doctor.” Fine. Do tests. But make it quick. Emergency… things.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology right away. The lab technician will call you to schedule an appointment. The X-ray won’t take long, and the blood work is relatively quick as well. While we wait for those results, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of a medication called Lisinopril to help lower your blood pressure. It's a common medication, and can often make a significant difference. I also recommend starting a low-sodium diet and getting some gentle exercise, if you're able. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Korean food… spicy. No problem. Stomach… sometimes upset. But that’s just food. No allergies. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, I’ll write the prescription for Lisinopril, and the nurse will explain the dosage and potential side effects to you before you leave. We'll review the results of the EKG, chest X-ray, and blood work as soon as they’re available, and discuss the next steps. I will schedule a follow up appointment for you in one week. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmph. Waste of time. Just… when can I go? Emergency… things. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your follow-up appointment. She can also answer any questions you may have before you go. I expect you should be able to leave in about 15 minutes. In the meantime, try to relax, and please call the clinic immediately if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’ll get this figured out.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Let me know. Emergency… things.
