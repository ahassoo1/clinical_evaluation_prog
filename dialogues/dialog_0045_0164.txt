DOCTOR: Alright, Mande Haggar, 51 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve gotten… yellow. Like, my skin and the whites of my eyes are yellowing. It started a few days ago, and I think it might be connected to some fava beans I ate. I had a big plate of them, and then the next day… well, this started.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, fava beans. I know it sounds odd. My grandmother used to make a wonderful stew with them, and I hadn’t had it in years, so I thought I’d try to make it myself. But now… I’m just worried. I’ve never had anything like this happen before. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Well, people get weird reactions to things all the time. It could be anything. But yellowing skin… that usually means something’s up with the liver. Have you had any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, and I haven’t thrown up. I did feel a little queasy yesterday morning, but I thought it was just something I ate. And I’ve been more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? It's mostly the yellowing that’s got me worried, and the timing with the beans. Could it really be from those? I've heard of people having… reactions to food, but I didn’t think it would turn me yellow.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a look. You said no abdominal pain, no vomiting… Any dark urine?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes, I think so. It's been darker than usual, I just figured I wasn’t drinking enough water. It’s been quite hot, you know? Is that… important? It hasn’t been painful to go, if that makes sense. Just… darker.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dark urine and yellowing… that's a bit more concerning. Look, I'm not saying it is the fava beans, but there's a rare condition called favism, it's an enzyme deficiency. Some people, particularly those of Mediterranean descent—which I believe Romanian falls under—can have trouble processing fava beans. It can cause hemolytic anemia – basically, your red blood cells are being broken down. We need to do some bloodwork to check your liver function and your blood counts.
PATIENT: Hemolytic… anemia? That sounds… scary. Mediterranean descent… my grandfather was from Greece, actually. I hadn't thought about that in years. So, the beans could actually be causing this? It’s just… it’s a lot to take in. What does the bloodwork involve? Will it be painful? And what if it is that… favism? What do you do about that?
DOCTOR: Look, don’t get yourself worked up. It’s potentially favism. And it’s not like it’s a death sentence. The bloodwork is a standard CBC—complete blood count—and a liver function panel. It’s just a quick draw, a little prick. You won't even feel it. If it is favism, we’ll monitor your blood counts, make sure you stay well hydrated, and absolutely avoid fava beans and anything else that might trigger it. We’ll also need to rule out other causes of jaundice—that’s what the yellowing is called—like gallstones or hepatitis. I’m going to order those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll get you right in.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that makes me feel a little better, knowing there’s something to do about it. Avoiding the beans seems… easy enough, at this point. And I’m happy to get some tests done to rule things out. Where exactly is the lab? And will I get the results right away, or will it take a few days? I'm a little anxious, to be honest, so knowing when I can expect to hear back would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Down there, first door on the left. Just tell them Dr. Billman sent you. As for the results, the CBC usually comes back pretty quickly, within a few hours. The liver function panel might take a day or two. The lab will let me know when they’re done. My nurse will call you with the results as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. Try not to worry about it too much. We're just being thorough. Now, is there anything else you wanted to discuss, or can we get you off to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just the lab, then. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I’ll go down there now. Hopefully it won’t take too long.
