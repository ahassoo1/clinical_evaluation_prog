DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for letting me know. That’s… a lot to process. Just to be clear, were you recently diagnosed with cancer, or is this related to a family history?
PATIENT: Recently diagnosed, Doctor. Just… a few weeks ago. It’s still very new to me, and honestly, I’m a little lost about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is a lot to take in. It's perfectly normal to feel lost and overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time. Can you tell me a bit about what kind of cancer you were diagnosed with, and where?
PATIENT: It’s… breast cancer, Doctor. In my right breast. They found a lump during a check-up. I don’t… I don’t know much about the specifics, to be honest. They just said it was a certain… stage? I forget the number.
DOCTOR: Okay, breast cancer in the right breast. That’s good information. Don’t worry about forgetting the stage number right now; that’s something we can definitely look up together. Do you happen to remember who told you about the diagnosis?
PATIENT: It was Doctor Ramirez, at the hospital. He did the… the biopsy. He said I should come see an oncologist, and that’s how I ended up here with you. He was very nice, but things moved so quickly.
DOCTOR: I see. Dr. Ramirez is a good doctor. It sounds like things did move quickly, which can be very unsettling. Do you have any of the reports from Dr. Ramirez with you today?
PATIENT: I… I think so. I have a folder here with some papers. Let me see… Yes, here it is. I think these are them. It’s all a little confusing.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Why don't you put the folder down there, and we'll go through it together. Don't worry about sorting it out, I can help. While you do that, can you tell me a little bit about your current symptoms?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I felt a lump, like I said. It didn't really hurt at first, but now it’s a little sore sometimes. I’ve also been feeling very tired, more tired than usual. And… and I’ve lost my appetite a bit. It's hard to explain. Everything just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed a sore lump in your right breast, increased fatigue, and a loss of appetite. That sounds really difficult. "Off" is a good way to describe it. Have you noticed any changes to the skin on your breast—any redness, dimpling, or thickening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so, not really. Maybe a little bit of… redness sometimes, but I thought it was just from rubbing against my clothes. Nothing obvious, I don’t think. I haven't really been looking closely, if that makes sense. I didn't really know what to look for.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. It’s very common not to know what to look for. We can definitely take a closer look today. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t have a lot of health problems. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My husband… he passed away last year. That was… hard. He had heart problems. That’s why I have Medicare now.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. Thank you for sharing that with me. Losing a spouse is a profound loss. And, so you've been generally healthy otherwise?
PATIENT: Yes, generally. No major illnesses or surgeries. No… allergies that I know of. My mother had high blood pressure, but that’s… that’s about it. I try to eat healthy, and I used to walk a lot more, before… well, before everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, no major medical issues, no known allergies, mother with high blood pressure. And you used to be more active. That's all helpful information. Do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s about it. Not regularly. Oh! And I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I’ve been forgetting lately. Everything's been a little… jumbled.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen for headaches and a multivitamin sometimes. That's good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any other health concerns or anything else you think I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… I guess… I’ve been feeling very anxious, of course. Just… with the cancer diagnosis. It's hard to think straight. And… sometimes I have trouble sleeping. Just… worrying. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s very important. Anxiety and trouble sleeping are very common—and very understandable—reactions to a cancer diagnosis. We'll definitely want to address those. It's good you're telling me. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a physical exam. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll examine your breasts. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I hope it doesn’t hurt too much.
DOCTOR: We’ll take it slow, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. It shouldn’t be painful, but you may feel some pressure. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m ready, I think. Just… let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, taking your heart rate now… it’s a little elevated, which is understandable given everything you’re going through, but otherwise sounds normal. Now, listening to your lungs… deep breath in… and out… again… sounds clear on both sides. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your lymph nodes – feeling for any swelling – starting under your jaw… No swelling here. And now, I’ll check your collarbone area. Still no swelling. Alright, now we'll move on to examining your breasts. Could you please point to the area where you felt the lump originally?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. It’s right here. It feels… harder than the rest. And it’s a little tender, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a palpable lump here in the upper outer quadrant of your right breast. It’s approximately… 1.5 centimeters in diameter. It feels firm, and somewhat irregular in shape. It is tender to the touch, as you mentioned. I don't feel any other lumps or suspicious areas at this time. Your skin doesn't appear red or dimpled. I also feel in your armpit for swollen lymph nodes but I don't feel any there. Now, I am going to use the back of my hand to feel if there is any warmth around the lump. It feels to be at room temperature, which is normal. Given the recent diagnosis, it's likely this is the lump that Dr. Ramirez found. I’m going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Okay. So… is it bad? What does this mean? I’m so scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you’re scared, Chellsea. It is frightening. And it’s okay to feel that way. Based on my exam, and the information you've given me, it’s consistent with a breast cancer diagnosis. But we have to look at the results of any tests Dr. Ramirez has done before we can know the specific type and stage. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to review Dr. Ramirez’s reports—biopsy results, imaging scans—and we may need to order some additional tests, such as a mammogram or MRI, to determine the extent of the cancer. I want to assure you that we have many treatment options available. Before we get into those, I need more information. Do you have copies of any imaging reports Dr. Ramirez ordered?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. They're in the folder, I believe. Here they are. There's a… a mammogram and something called an ultrasound, I think. And there’s a report about the biopsy. I don't understand any of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me take a look. Alright, so Dr. Ramirez did a mammogram, an ultrasound, and a biopsy. The mammogram shows a suspicious mass in the upper outer quadrant of your right breast, as you already knew. The ultrasound confirmed the presence of a solid nodule. The biopsy report… … confirms the diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. That is the most common type of breast cancer. It is a grade 2, which means the cancer cells are moderately aggressive, and it’s hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen and progesterone. It’s HER2-negative, which is good news, as that means we don’t have to worry about that particular pathway. Do you have any questions about that, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Invasive… ductal… carcinoma? Hormone… receptor…? I… I don’t understand any of that. It all sounds… scary. What does it mean? And what happens now? I feel… completely overwhelmed. Is it… is it curable?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, Chellsea. That’s a lot of medical terminology. Let’s break it down. "Invasive ductal carcinoma" means the cancer started in the milk ducts and has spread into the surrounding breast tissue. The hormone receptor-positive status means we can treat the cancer with hormone therapy, which blocks the estrogen and progesterone from fueling its growth. The fact that it’s HER2-negative is also good—it simplifies the treatment plan. As for the question of whether it’s curable… that’s a complex question. Breast cancer treatment has come a long way, and the vast majority of people with early-stage breast cancer are able to live long, healthy lives. The specifics will depend on the stage of the cancer and your overall health. Based on these initial reports, it appears to be Stage 1 or Stage 2, which are highly treatable. The next step is to get a more precise staging scan - a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to make sure the cancer hasn't spread to other parts of your body. After that, we can discuss the treatment options in detail, which may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: A CT scan… surgery… chemotherapy… It sounds… terrifying. But… if most people can live long, healthy lives… that gives me a little hope. What kind of surgery? Will I lose my breast? And… will the chemotherapy make me sick? I’m so sorry for all the questions. I just… I don’t know where to start.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Chellsea. These are all perfectly valid concerns, and it’s important to address them. It’s good that you’re asking. The type of surgery depends on the size of the tumor and your overall breast health. We could potentially do a lumpectomy, which removes the tumor and a small amount of surrounding tissue, preserving most of your breast. Or, if the tumor is larger, we might recommend a mastectomy, which removes the entire breast. We’d discuss the pros and cons of each option and make a decision together. We also offer reconstructive surgery if you choose to have a mastectomy. As for chemotherapy… yes, it can cause side effects like nausea, fatigue, and hair loss. But there are medications to help manage those side effects, and the side effects vary depending on the type of chemotherapy you receive. The goal is to minimize those side effects as much as possible. We will have a team of specialists helping you throughout the treatment process—surgeons, oncologists, radiation therapists, nurses—and they will be there to support you every step of the way. Right now, let's focus on getting that staging scan scheduled. Then we can set up a longer appointment with an oncologist to discuss the treatment plan in detail. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds good. Getting the scan sounds like the next step. And knowing I'll have a team… that makes me feel a little better. When can I schedule the scan? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this over with, if that makes any sense. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chellsea. It feels like your life has been put on hold, and you just want to get to the other side. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the CT scan for you right away. She'll call you later today to set up a time that works for you. Typically, it takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back from the radiologist. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a longer appointment with Dr. Ramirez, the oncologist, to discuss the treatment plan in detail. In the meantime, if you’re feeling overwhelmed or anxious, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We have resources available to help with emotional support, and I can provide a referral to a therapist if you’d like. For today, I want you to focus on taking care of yourself. Rest, eat healthy, and try to stay positive. We’re here for you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for being so patient. I just… I’m still scared, but I feel a little less lost than I did before.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help. And it’s perfectly okay to be scared. It's a natural reaction. Remember, you’re not alone in this. We will face this together. I’ll have Sarah come in to schedule the CT scan and give you some information about support resources. She'll also schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a couple of weeks, once you’ve had a chance to process everything. In the meantime, take care of yourself. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
