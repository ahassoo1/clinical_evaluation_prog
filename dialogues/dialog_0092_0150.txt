DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, Doctor… Giganti, is it? Look, I don't have all day. I want a baby. And I want it to be… uncomplicated. I’m 51, not 80. I don’t want any… problems. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, that is perfectly clear. You're interested in pursuing pregnancy and want to ensure a healthy outcome. I understand your concerns, and we will certainly do everything we can to assess your situation and address any potential risks. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly. What does that even matter? I feel fine. Divorced, one ex-husband, Medicare covers everything... Is that what you need to know? I’m perfectly healthy. I cycle. A lot. Don’t you doctors have… tests for this sort of thing? To see if everything is working, as it were? Let’s skip the life story, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. While you feel healthy, some medical factors can influence a successful pregnancy, even if you’re feeling well. Knowing your past medical history helps us create the safest plan for you. However, we can certainly start with some initial tests to assess your current health and reproductive function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Tests. Whatever. Just… make them quick. And don’t tell me about every single possible… complication. I really don't need a lecture. Blood work? Hormones? Just tell me what needs to be done, and let's get it over with. Is there a nurse who can handle this, or do you have to personally draw my blood?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll start with a comprehensive blood panel. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and hormone levels to evaluate your ovarian reserve and overall hormonal balance. We will also check your thyroid levels, as thyroid function is important for fertility. A nurse will be able to draw your blood for the initial panel. I will review the results with you afterwards and discuss any further testing that may be needed. Would you like me to explain the purpose of each test in a little more detail, or would you prefer I simply have the nurse come in to collect the sample?
PATIENT: No, no explanations. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got time for a biology lesson. Just get the nurse in here. And make sure she's competent. I don't want a mess. I’m a bicycle repairer, not a pincushion. Let’s move this along.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ll let the nurse know you're ready. She will be in shortly with the necessary supplies. While we wait, perhaps you could tell me if you have any allergies to medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I'm Hungarian, we’re built tough. I might be a little sensitive to incompetence, but that’s not an allergy. Now, are you going to call this nurse, or are we just sitting here? I have a very busy afternoon. And I need to calibrate some derailleur mechanisms. It’s delicate work, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, I’ve just sent a message to the nurse. She should be with you shortly. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Look, I take a multivitamin. Sometimes. When I remember. And ibuprofen if my knees ache from cycling. That's it. Do I need to list every single painkiller I've ever consumed? This is ridiculous. Just get on with the tests, Doctor. I’m starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s helpful to have that information. Now, before the nurse arrives, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Obviously. If I had been pregnant before, I wouldn’t be sitting here now, would I? Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening? This is basic logic. Now, can we please, please get this over with? I have important things to do. Bikes don’t repair themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Shteynberg. My apologies. It appears I was being unnecessarily repetitive. Let's move on then. Have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for a serious illness?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I'm a healthy, strong woman. I’ve broken a few bones cycling—a wrist, once, a collarbone—but that's hardly a major surgery. And I haven’t spent a night in a hospital since… well, never. Honestly, Doctor, I'm beginning to question your competence. Are you sure you've done this before? This is getting tiresome.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shteynberg, I assure you I have extensive experience in this area. Knowing about previous fractures, even minor ones, is helpful, as they can sometimes impact overall health. Could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Really? What possible relevance could my Aunt Ilona’s bunions have to my ability to get pregnant? Honestly! My grandmother lived to be 98, if that’s what you want to know, and she never had a baby. Happy now? Everyone on my mother’s side is… sturdy. That’s the best way to put it. No hereditary diseases, no premature deaths, just… sturdy Hungarians. Can we please move on? I'm wasting valuable time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That’s helpful to know. Before the nurse arrives, let me ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Drink? Are you serious? Do I look like someone who would ruin their body with such… vices? Honestly, Doctor, the questions you're asking are… insulting. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Cycling, fresh air, proper nutrition. I'm a practical woman, I understand the importance of taking care of myself. Now, are you going to perform these tests, or are you going to continue interrogating me about my personal life? I have a business to run, you know. Bikes don't fix themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. You lead a very healthy lifestyle, and I appreciate you sharing that information. One final question before the nurse arrives: How would you describe your typical menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must we? It’s… irregular. It comes and goes. Frankly, it’s been even more irregular lately. It’s not like it's a predictable clockwork operation, if that’s what you’re expecting. It's… a cycle. What else do you want to know? Length? Flow? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a bicycle repairer, not a gynecologist. I don’t keep detailed records of my… internal affairs. Now, where is that nurse? I’m losing my patience.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. Irregular cycles can be common, especially as we age. Nurse Davies, could you please assist Ms. Shteynberg with drawing some blood work?
PATIENT: Finally. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And don’t poke me too many times. I have important things to do. Really. Important things. Bikes, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just let me know if you’re feeling any discomfort. .
PATIENT: .
