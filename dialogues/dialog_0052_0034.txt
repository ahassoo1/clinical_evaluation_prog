DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Dr. Shely. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I just moved here. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, I guess? It's for my, um… the health thing? Medicare? I don't really know how it all works around here.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure about how things work – that’s what I’m here for. Establishing care with a primary physician is an excellent first step. And yes, you are covered through Medicare, which is good to know. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. I… I work with machines? Fixing them. It's pretty physical, I guess. I mean, I lift stuff and… things. I don't really get sick much, I don't think. I'm married, if that matters? I… honestly, I'm not good at remembering stuff like this. Is there a form I could fill out or something?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright; many patients find it easier to write things down. Yes, we do have a new patient questionnaire – I'll have the medical assistant bring one over for you to complete at your leisure. It covers a lot of the basic information, including past medical history, family history, and any medications you might be taking. However, let’s start with a few quick questions while we wait. You mentioned you work with machines and it’s physically demanding. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort currently as a result of your work?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. My back gets a bit sore, especially at the end of the day. And my hands, you know, from using tools all the time. It's not, like, bad pain, just… tired. I don't usually do anything about it, just rest. I don't know if that's important? I'm not sure what kind of pain is important.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, Emileigh. Back and hand soreness with physically demanding work is certainly something we should address. It is important. Even seemingly minor discomfort can become more significant if left unaddressed. Just to clarify, is this soreness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly at the end of the day, like I said. Sometimes if I've been working on something really tricky, it'll bother me more. Not… every day though. Some days I forget about it completely. I don’t think it’s… stopping me from doing anything, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, it's intermittent, related to your work, and not currently limiting your activities. We’ll want to explore this further, but that gives us a good starting point. Now, aside from the back and hand soreness, have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… um… no, not really. I've been a little tired lately, but I think that's just from working long hours. And… I think I had a cold a few months ago, but I don't remember much about it. It wasn't bad. I… honestly, I'm drawing a blank. I don't usually go to the doctor, so I don't really have symptoms I can think of. Is there something I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s common for patients to not readily recall specific symptoms, especially if they don't typically seek medical attention. We’re simply going through a routine review to get a comprehensive understanding of your health. Let’s switch gears a bit. Have you had any significant medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don't think so. I definitely haven't had any surgeries. Illnesses… I had chickenpox when I was a kid, I think. And maybe the flu a couple of times. Nothing major. My grandma… she had something with her heart, but that wasn't me. I… I’m not good at remembering family stuff either. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. You are not expected to have a perfect medical history memorized. Chickenpox and occasional flu are common childhood illnesses. It’s helpful to know about your grandmother’s heart condition; we can inquire further about that later if needed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don’t really take pills. Maybe… sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Not regularly. And… no vitamins or anything. I try to eat okay, I guess. I don't really like taking stuff if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's probably just… fur. Not a real allergy, I don’t think. I don’t avoid anything, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication or food allergies, and a possible mild reaction to cats. We can document that as a potential sensitivity. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work a lot. Like, long hours. I go home, eat dinner with my husband, and then usually go to bed. We don't really go out much. We like to watch TV. Is that what you mean? I don't really have hobbies or anything. I just… work. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Emileigh. It simply helps me understand your daily routine and potential risk factors. It sounds like you have a busy work schedule. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I don’t like the smell. And no alcohol either. My husband doesn't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And definitely no drugs. I don't even know anyone who does drugs.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Emileigh. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you’d like to mention or any specific concerns you have that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t know. I guess… I just want to make sure I’m healthy. I haven't been to the doctor in a long time, so I'm a little nervous, I guess. And I want to be able to keep working. I like my job. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Emileigh. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous when establishing care with a new doctor, especially after a long time without a check-up. And wanting to maintain your health so you can continue working is a very valid concern. Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical exam. We’ll start with checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. If you’re comfortable, we can also take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… try not to poke too much?
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let’s begin. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay… here we go.
DOCTOR: Alright, vital signs are all good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths in and out. Now, I'm going to briefly palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Overall, the initial physical exam findings are within normal limits. Your height is 150 cm, and your weight is 82 kg. This gives you a BMI of 36.2, which falls into the obese category. We can discuss healthy weight management strategies later if you're interested. Now, do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Obese? Oh. I… I know I'm not small. I just… never really thought about it. Weight management… I guess. It's just… hard when I work so much. I don't know where to start. And… does that mean I’m unhealthy? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel concerned, Emileigh. A BMI of 36.2 does indicate obesity, but it's important to remember that BMI is just one factor in assessing overall health. It doesn’t define you, and it doesn't automatically mean you are unhealthy. Many people with a higher BMI lead healthy lives. However, it does increase your risk for certain health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. And you are right, it can be challenging to manage your weight, especially with a demanding work schedule. We can absolutely discuss strategies for healthy weight management, if you’re interested. It doesn’t have to be a drastic overhaul; small, sustainable changes can make a big difference. We can talk about diet, exercise, and other lifestyle modifications. I can also refer you to a registered dietitian if you’d like. Would you be open to exploring some of those options?
PATIENT: Okay. Small changes… that sounds… better. I don't want to go on a diet or anything. I just… want to feel better. And maybe not get sick so easily. What kind of small changes are you thinking about? And… is it going to be expensive? I don't want to spend a lot of money.
DOCTOR: That’s a great approach, Emileigh. Small, sustainable changes are much more likely to be successful in the long run. And no, it doesn’t have to be expensive. We can start with simple things, like incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your meals, choosing whole grains over refined grains, and drinking more water. We can also talk about finding ways to be more active throughout the day, even if it's just taking the stairs instead of the elevator or going for a short walk during your lunch break. Regarding a registered dietitian referral, the cost will depend on your insurance coverage. Let me check your benefits to see what’s covered. In the meantime, I can provide you with some resources and information about healthy eating and exercise that you can start with on your own. Now, to get a more complete picture of your health, I'd like to order some basic blood work. This will help us assess your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. If you think it's important. Will it hurt? And… how long does it take? I don’t have a lot of free time. And… is it covered by Medicare? I don’t want to get a big bill.
DOCTOR: No, the blood work doesn’t hurt. It’s just a quick prick of the needle to draw a small sample of blood. Most people don’t even feel it. The process itself usually takes just a few minutes, but you’ll need to be fasting for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. And yes, it is covered by Medicare, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary. We’ll submit the claim for you, and you’ll receive an Explanation of Benefits statement detailing the charges and coverage. The lab is conveniently located just down the street, and you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. I'll give you a lab requisition form and instructions on how to schedule your appointment. We can also discuss the results at your follow-up appointment, which we can schedule for about two weeks from today. Does that sound alright, Emileigh?
PATIENT: Okay, that… sounds manageable. Two weeks is good. I’ll try to remember to fast. And I'll schedule the appointment. Thank you. You've been very helpful. I feel a little better now. I think… I think that’s everything. For now. Is it okay if I ask you questions if I think of something later?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns that arise later. That’s what we’re here for. We can schedule a phone consultation or another appointment if needed. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. We’ve covered a lot today – establishing care, discussing your medical history, performing a physical exam, and ordering blood work. We'll discuss the results in two weeks and develop a plan to address any concerns. Here’s the lab requisition form and some information about healthy eating and exercise. If you need a registered dietitian referral, let me know, and I'll get that processed for you. Do you have any other immediate questions before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Shely. You were very patient with me. I guess I'll see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Emileigh. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, small steps can make a big difference. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. .
