DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it's a bit hard to explain. Basically, the sun's been bothering me a lot lately. Not like a sunburn, exactly. More like… everything’s just too bright, and it really hurts my eyes. It started a few months back, I think, maybe around April?
DOCTOR: April…right. Okay. And is this brightness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. Some days it's barely noticeable, especially if it’s cloudy. But on really sunny days… whew. Even with sunglasses, it feels like someone’s shining a light right in my eyes. It makes me squint a lot. It also feels like… my eyes are tired even when I haven't done much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. Tiredness with the brightness… Hmm. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… let me think. Not blurry, not really. Things seem the same distance-wise, if that makes sense. But sometimes colours look… washed out, almost. Like they aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. It’s a hard thing to explain, though. It's not a major thing, just… different. And it's mostly when the sun is bright, like now we're talking about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any headaches with this, or any nausea?
PATIENT: Headaches… yeah, actually. Not every time, but when the light's really bad, I get a throbbing headache behind my eyes. Like a pressure. And… now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a little queasy too, especially if I’ve been outside for a while. It's not full-on throwing up, just… not feeling well. Sorry, I’m rambling a bit. It’s just… it’s been unsettling.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's perfectly alright. It’s good to be thorough. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I was pretty healthy, all things considered. High blood pressure, maybe, a few years back, but it was controlled with some medication. I haven't taken anything for it in a while, though. The doctor said it was fine. And… well, I lost my wife last year, so… there's that. But nothing major health-wise, before this started happening. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Komarov. Medicare is noted. And the blood pressure… do you remember what medication you were on for that?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a tough time. As for the medication… uh… let me think. It was a little white pill… I think it started with an 'A'? Amlodipine, maybe? I’m really bad with names and medications. My wife always handled those things for me. I just took what she gave me. Sorry, I know it's not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, alright. We can check the records. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never really had a reaction to anything. My wife used to ask every time the doctor prescribed something, and I’d always say no. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, taken different medicines when I was sick as a child… never anything. Just the usual aches and pains, really. I don't have any allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And… family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mother had glaucoma, I think. She needed eye drops all the time. And my father… he had diabetes. And heart problems, I think. But other than that, not really. We didn't keep a very detailed history. It wasn't really something we talked about much. Does that help? I'm trying to think, but it's been a while since I thought about all of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your eyes, just to see what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to help. I'm just hoping you can figure out what's making my eyes so sensitive. It's really starting to bother me, especially with the summer sun.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I’m going to dim the lights a bit. And I’ll check your pupils, your visual fields, and do a quick look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It won’t be painful. Okay, follow my pen with your eyes… good. Now look straight ahead… Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Visual fields appear… slightly constricted, but not dramatically so. And… Hmm. There’s a mild amount of drusen present in the macula. Not severe, but something to note. The optic nerves appear healthy. No signs of swelling or damage. Overall, the fundus looks relatively normal, given your age, but the drusen is something we'll want to keep an eye on. </stage>
PATIENT: Okay... drusen, you said? What does that mean exactly? Is that bad? And constricted visual fields… does that explain why everything feels so bright? Sorry for all the questions, Doctor. I just… I worry.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Komarov. It's good to ask questions. Drusen are small deposits that can form under the retina, especially as we get older. They're often a sign of age-related macular degeneration, though you have mild drusen, not the severe type. It doesn’t explain the light sensitivity directly, but it’s something we need to monitor. As for the constricted visual fields…it’s subtle, but it could be contributing to the feeling of brightness. It means your peripheral vision isn’t quite as wide as it used to be. It’s not definitive, but it’s possible you have early cataracts, which can cause glare and light sensitivity. It's difficult to say for certain without further testing. I'm going to order a visual field test and a slit-lamp exam. The slit lamp will allow a closer look at the lens of your eye and confirm whether you have cataracts. We will also check your intraocular pressure. Do you have any trouble with halos around lights at night?
PATIENT: Halos around lights… hmm. Not really, no. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I don't drive much anymore, mostly just short trips to the store during the day. My wife used to do all the night driving. So I haven’t paid attention. But no, I don’t think I see halos. So, a visual field test and a slit lamp exam… and checking the pressure… Is that all? And… how long will it take to get those results? I just want to know what’s going on, you know? This is making me a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Komarov. We will get to the bottom of this. Yes, those tests will give us a clearer picture. The visual field test should take about 20-30 minutes, and the slit lamp exam is relatively quick. It's possible we might need to repeat the visual field test if there are inaccuracies. The results should be available within a week, but I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as they’re in. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend artificial tears to help with any dryness you may be experiencing. And continue to wear sunglasses whenever you’re outdoors, even on cloudy days. Given your history of high blood pressure, I'd also like to recheck your blood pressure today, just to make sure it’s under control. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Sunglasses and eye drops… I can definitely do that. Rechecking my blood pressure is fine too. I haven't had it checked in a while, so it's probably a good idea. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It does ease my mind a little bit, just knowing we're looking into it. I just hope it's not anything too serious. I really don't want to lose my sight.
DOCTOR: We're going to do everything we can to protect your vision, Mr. Komarov. Let's get your blood pressure checked first. Just relax your arm. We’ll take it a few times to make sure we get an accurate reading. 142 over 88… and again… 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Given your history, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, to help lower it. It's a medication often used for blood pressure control. I’ll send this to your pharmacy. Do you have any questions about this medication?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… I think I remember hearing that name before. Does it have a lot of side effects? My wife always worried about side effects. And is that all I need to take? Just the Lisinopril and the eye drops? I just want to keep it as simple as possible, you know? Too many medications make me nervous. And… will this medication affect my eyes at all? Like, make the light sensitivity worse? I’m sorry, I’m probably asking a lot of questions. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Komarov. It's perfectly normal to be concerned. Lisinopril is generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, it can have side effects. The most common ones are dizziness, fatigue, and a dry cough. Dizziness is usually temporary and occurs when you first start taking it. Rarely, it can cause kidney problems, so we’ll monitor your kidney function with blood tests. As for your eyes, Lisinopril doesn't typically worsen light sensitivity. In rare cases, it can cause changes in vision, but that's uncommon. We’ll keep an eye on your vision during your follow-up appointments. For now, you'll take the Lisinopril once daily, along with the artificial tears as needed. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin. It's a good idea to keep your overall health in check. Before you go, I’d like to discuss a possible referral to an ophthalmologist. While I can manage the initial investigation, a specialist will be able to provide a more comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist… yes, I think that sounds wise. If you think it's best, I'm happy to go. I just want to make sure everything is taken care of properly. I trust your judgment, Doctor. So, yes, please, a referral. Will my insurance cover that? Medicare, you know. And… will you send the results of the tests to them, or do I need to do that myself? I just want to make sure everything goes smoothly. I don’t want to get stuck with a big bill.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I agree, a specialist’s opinion is a good idea. Yes, Medicare should cover a referral to an ophthalmologist, but it’s always best to confirm with them directly. My assistant will provide you with a list of ophthalmologists who accept Medicare. We will also send all of your test results, along with your medical history, to the ophthalmologist’s office. You shouldn’t have to worry about doing that yourself. We’ll also send a copy of the results to your primary care physician. So, to recap: you’ll start taking the Lisinopril and use the artificial tears as needed. You’ll have a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist, and we’ll monitor your blood pressure. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns and explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing we have a plan. I appreciate your help. And thank you to your assistant as well, for sending the lists and everything. I’ll call Medicare and schedule the appointment with the ophthalmologist. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I’m glad I could help. No, I don't think there's anything else for you to do today. Just remember to take the medications as prescribed and call your insurance if you have any difficulties scheduling the appointment. My assistant will escort you to the checkout desk. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
