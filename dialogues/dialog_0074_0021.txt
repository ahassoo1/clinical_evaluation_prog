DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my foot, see? It's been swelling up something fierce. Not all of a sudden, mind you. It's been getting worse over, oh, I'd say the last week or so. It's my left one.
DOCTOR: Okay, your left foot is swelling, and it’s been gradually worsening over the past week. That’s helpful to know. Could you describe the swelling to me a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a bruise, if that makes sense. It's just… puffy. All over, really. From my toes right up to my ankle. And it feels kinda warm to the touch, too. Not burning, just… warmer than my other foot. It's not always swollen, though. Worse at the end of the day, definitely. After I've been on my feet a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, puffy swelling all over the left foot and ankle, warmer to the touch, and worse at the end of the day after being on your feet. That helps me narrow things down. Is there any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Yeah, there is, now that you mention it. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. Especially if I try to, you know, move it around a lot. Or if I press on it. Not awful, but enough to notice. And sometimes, in the evenings, I get a little cramping in my calf on the same side. Could be something else, but figured I'd mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with movement and pressure, and some cramping in your left calf, especially in the evenings. I appreciate you sharing all of that. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin on your foot or ankle, or any sores or breaks in the skin?
PATIENT: No, no color changes. It looks pretty normal, just… bigger. And no sores, thankfully. I check it pretty regular, being on my feet all day and all. Skin feels normal, just… stretched, I guess you’d say. Nothing broken or anything like that. I'd notice that.
DOCTOR: Good. No color changes or breaks in the skin. That's reassuring. Now, have you experienced any recent injury to your foot or ankle?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I can recall. I haven't twisted it or dropped anything on it, or anything like that. It just...started swelling, slowly. I'm a loan interviewer, you see? Mostly sitting, paperwork, talking to people. I do a fair bit of walking to different offices, but nothing strenuous. Not like construction work or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injury, and your work involves mostly sitting with some walking. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t been to a doctor in…well, a long time. Honestly. Just for a cold or the flu now and then. Never been told I have anything. I eat okay, I guess. Try to, anyway. And I don’t smoke. Never did. My mother, she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, but that was a long time ago. She was back home, you see? Somalia. Different doctors there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, and a family history of joint trouble in your mother. Thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And haven't been to the hospital since…well, never in this country, anyway. Back home, I was a little boy. Just a tonsillectomy, I think it was. But that was…a long, long time ago. I haven’t needed much medical care, thankfully. I try to stay healthy. It's hard, being on my own and all. No insurance, you see? So you gotta be careful.
DOCTOR: I understand. No surgeries or hospitalizations besides a childhood tonsillectomy, and you’re navigating healthcare without insurance. That gives me a good picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to any medicine. Tried some different pain relievers for headaches over the years, but nothing serious. Just the over-the-counter stuff, you see? Aspirin, ibuprofen…nothing makes me break out in hives or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just water. And coffee, of course, to get through the day. I don't believe in taking pills unless I absolutely have to. My mother always said, “Let food be your medicine,” you see? So I try to eat right. Mostly rice and fish. It’s not fancy, but it keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Okay, Mr. Parascandola, I think I have a good understanding of your history now. Would you mind if I take a look at your foot and ankle?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to help any way I can. I'm just hoping you can figure out what's going on with it. It's getting harder and harder to get around, you see? And I need to work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Could you please sit on the examination table and extend your left leg?
PATIENT: Alright, no problem. Here you go, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some warmth around your ankle and a bit of tenderness on the inner side. Your pulses are present and normal. And you do have some limited range of motion, especially when I ask you to point your toes downwards. There's some swelling around your malleoli - that's the bony parts on either side of your ankle. It doesn’t seem to be acutely injured, and there’s no sign of redness or open wounds, which is good. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. When you press right there, on the inside. Not a sharp pain, but a dull ache, like I said before. And when you move it like that… yeah, that's a bit uncomfortable. It's not terrible, but I definitely feel it. Feels like it's stretching something.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing some swelling and discomfort due to a possible sprain or strain of the ligaments around your ankle. It’s also possible it could be early signs of arthritis, but we’d need further investigation to confirm that. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an X-ray of your left ankle to rule out any fractures or other bone abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray, huh? Well, I don't have insurance, Doctor. Is that going to be expensive? I'm not sure I can afford it. I've been trying to save up for… well, it doesn’t matter. But money's tight, you see? What's the cost looking like?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Parascandola. I understand not having insurance makes things difficult. Let me see what the cost of an X-ray would be at this facility. Okay, it looks like a single X-ray of your left ankle would be $150. I also want to be upfront and say that if we do find something concerning on the X-ray, we may need to discuss further imaging, like an MRI, which would be significantly more expensive. However, let's start with the X-ray and see what it shows. We could also discuss some conservative treatment options - like rest, ice, compression, and elevation - and see if that helps alleviate your symptoms without needing further imaging. Would you be interested in exploring that option first?
PATIENT: $150… That’s… a lot. I was hoping it wouldn't be so much. I don't know, Doctor. Maybe…maybe we try the rest and ice first? See if that helps? I can definitely afford to do that. I have some ice packs at home. I can wrap it up with a bandage. I don't want to get into debt over this foot, you see? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Parascandola. That’s a very reasonable approach, and I completely respect your decision. We can definitely start with conservative treatment. Okay, let's focus on RICE – Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Rest: Avoid activities that aggravate your pain. Try to limit walking and standing as much as possible. Ice: Apply an ice pack to your ankle for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Make sure to wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your skin. Compression: Wrap your ankle with an elastic bandage to provide support and reduce swelling. Be careful not to wrap it too tightly, as that can cut off circulation. Elevation: Elevate your leg above your heart as much as possible, especially when you're resting. I'd like to see you back in one week to assess your progress. If your symptoms haven't improved, or if they get worse, we can reconsider the X-ray. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. One week, and if it's not better, we'll talk about the X-ray again. I can do all that – rest, ice, wrap it, keep it up. Thank you for understanding. And thank you for not pushing the expensive stuff right away. I really appreciate that. Do I need a special bandage, or is just a regular one okay?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. I always try to work with my patients to find the most appropriate and affordable treatment plan. For the bandage, a regular elastic bandage will be fine. You can find them at most pharmacies. Just make sure it's snug but not too tight. If your skin starts to feel numb or tingly, or if your toes start to turn blue, loosen the bandage immediately. I'm going to write you a note summarizing these instructions, just so you have it in writing. And I'll also include a note for work, explaining that you have a foot injury and may need to limit your activity. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That's wonderful, Doctor, thank you for the note for work, that will be a big help. No, I think that’s everything. I appreciate your time and your kindness. I'll see you next week. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. You have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: .
