DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. So, Mrs. Sciarotta, you’re here today… for what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well, I need to get that card… the one for driving, you know? For the ride-share thing. A commercial driver medical card, that’s right. I’m starting to drive for a little extra money, and they need that card. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly. But here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver’s license… or the medical certification for one. Yes, well, it’s… prudent to ensure one is medically fit for such an undertaking. Though, at your age… We shall see. Have you been experiencing any health problems recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, at my age… yes, a few things creak, naturally! But nothing major. Let me think… My knees bother me a bit when it rains, and sometimes my back gets stiff. But I take some over-the-counter stuff for it. Mostly, I’m pretty good. I walk every day, you know. Keeps me going. But really, nothing that would stop me from driving. I don’t think so, anyway. Do you want me to list everything? Because that could take a while.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t list everything. A comprehensive recitation of every ache and pain is… unnecessary. The knees and back… when did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… the knees, probably about five years ago? It comes and goes, really. Worse with the weather, like I said. The back… hmm. Maybe ten years ago? It flares up if I lift something heavy, or sit too long. But I’m careful now. I try not to strain myself. It hasn’t gotten worse lately, if that makes sense. Just… always there, a little bit. I mostly just ignore it.
DOCTOR: Right. And you manage this with… over-the-counter medication, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Mostly ibuprofen. And sometimes a little bit of that… menthol rub? For my back. The kind you rub on. It helps take the edge off. Nothing prescribed, nothing strong. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. It just feels… unnecessary. I’ve always been a tough old bird, you see. I try to handle things myself.
DOCTOR: "Tough old bird," is it?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear, I didn't mean to sound… disrespectful. It’s just… my way of saying I don’t complain much. And I try to keep myself active. I didn’t mean to imply I don’t take things seriously. I just… I’m used to dealing with a little discomfort. Is that… alright? I can be quiet if you'd prefer. I don’t want to take up your time.
DOCTOR: No, no. It’s… noted. We shall proceed. Have you any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. My heart is fine, thank you very much. My father lived to be eighty-eight, and he had a strong heart. I’ve always been pretty active, as I said. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. I get a little winded going up the stairs sometimes, but who doesn’t? I have had a bit of high blood pressure in the past, but it’s been well-controlled with… well, nothing really. Just watching my salt intake. I think it’s under control now. Doctor said it was fine at my last checkup. A few years ago, though. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: "A few years ago" is… imprecise, Mrs. Sciarotta. Do you recall the last time a physician specifically assessed your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right. You’re absolutely right. Let me think… it was… Dr. Tanaka. He retired, you know? About three years ago, I think. Maybe four. He was the one who said I just needed to watch my salt. I haven’t really seen a doctor since then, to be honest. Just… haven't needed to. Everything has been fine. I’ve been feeling perfectly well. But I remember the reading being a little high that day. But he said it wasn’t anything to worry about. Unless I started feeling dizzy or something. I haven’t felt dizzy.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, beyond the ibuprofen and menthol rub?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Sometimes I take a little something for my… sleep. Just a melatonin tablet. Sometimes I have trouble getting to sleep. It's not every night, just when I'm a bit anxious. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor recommended it a few years ago. Said I wasn't getting enough sunlight. That’s about it, I think. Really. I try to keep it simple. Are you writing all this down? It feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting your… history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Nothing at all. I've always been pretty lucky that way. No rashes, no swelling, no trouble breathing. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don't care for beets, but that's a personal preference, not an allergy. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, ever. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Is that… good? It feels like a good thing, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Well, Mrs. Sciarotta, perhaps we should conduct a brief physical examination. If you would be so kind as to step onto the scale, please. Then we will assess your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. This is standard procedure, you understand. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you need, Doctor. A physical exam is fine. I haven't had one in a while, but I’m sure I'm alright. I just hope I haven't gained too much weight! It's hard to resist sweets, you know. But, please, let me know if anything seems wrong. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: 139 pounds. And your height is recorded as 155 centimeters. 148 over 92. Heart rate is regular, but… slightly elevated. Lungs are clear. I note a slight… obesity and elevated blood pressure. Do you have any history of diabetes or a family history of the disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Obesity? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? I suppose I do enjoy my food a bit too much. And 148 over 92… that is high, isn’t it? Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Not me. But… my aunt Mildred, on my mother’s side, she had it. Yes, she did. She had to take insulin shots. It wasn't very pleasant. She wasn't very careful with her diet, you see. Always eating cookies and cakes. But I'm not like that! I mean, I like cookies, but I don’t eat them every day. And I walk every day. Does that count for something? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Walking is… beneficial. But it appears we have a situation that requires further attention. Given your blood pressure reading and family history, I recommend a fasting blood glucose test and a lipid panel. And I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a cardiologist. This is not a matter to be taken lightly. We must rule out diabetes and assess your cardiovascular risk.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A cardiologist? And a blood test? That sounds… serious. Is it really that bad? I feel perfectly fine, you know. Maybe the blood pressure was just a fluke? It could have been something I ate. Or maybe I was a little anxious coming here. But a cardiologist… and a cardiologist visit… that sounds expensive. And a lot of trouble. Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just monitor my blood pressure at home? I really don’t want to go to a specialist if it’s not necessary. I'm trying to save my money.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarotta, I understand your… concerns. However, I am obligated to provide you with the appropriate level of care, and frankly, your blood pressure reading is unacceptable. "Monitoring at home" is insufficient. A proper diagnosis is required, and a cardiologist is the appropriate specialist for that. I will provide you with a referral, and a requisition form for the blood tests. It is your responsibility to schedule these appointments. Delaying appropriate medical care could have… serious consequences. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. You’re right, of course. I should listen to you. It’s just… a lot to take in. A cardiologist and blood tests… Alright. A referral and a form. Fine. Do you think I can still get that card for driving? Or will this… everything… prevent me from getting it? It’s important to me, you see. I need the money. Will the cardiologist need all my medical history? I don't have it all readily available. Oh dear. This is all so complicated.
DOCTOR: Whether or not you are eligible for the commercial driver’s license will depend on the cardiologist’s assessment and the results of your blood tests. They will likely require your medical history, yes. I suggest you gather whatever records you can. Frankly, Mrs. Sciarotta, given your current health status, I strongly advise you to reconsider this… endeavor. It is not worth jeopardizing your well-being. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. No… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I suppose I’ll schedule the appointments. And try to gather my records. It’s just… a lot. I hope I’m still able to drive… even if it’s just for a little while. .
DOCTOR: Good day. .
