DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, if that’s all. Medicare sent ‘em, said I gotta have ‘em done. Nothing’s wrong, thankfully.
DOCTOR: “Just forms.” Right. Well, Medicare is… thorough. However, as your physician, I still need to ascertain why Medicare sent you these forms. It’s a requirement, frankly. Sometimes these forms indicate a need for a more thorough assessment, even if you feel fine. It's best to be certain. So, let's start with the basics. Have you experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Okay, well, changes… hmm. Not really, no. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Work keeps me busy, which is good. I install and repair valves, mostly for water systems. It’s physical, but I like that. Nothing hurting or anything like that, if that’s what you mean. It’s just…forms are always a bit of a hassle, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, forms are a hassle. But let’s not get sidetracked. “Pretty good” is subjective, Ms. Fabing. You work a physically demanding job. Are you experiencing any fatigue, even mild, that’s different than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good point. I guess… maybe a little more tired than usual lately. But it’s been hot, you know? Real hot this summer. And like I said, work’s been steady. So I figured it was just that. It’s not like I can’t get the job done, or anything. Just… a little slower to get going in the mornings, maybe. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “A little slower to get going.” Alright. And is this fatigue accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else… let me think. My sleep’s been okay, I guess. Not amazing, but I’m not waking up exhausted or anything. Maybe a little more thirsty than usual? I drink a lot of water anyway, with the work, but I feel like I’ve been reaching for it more often. And… now that you mention it, maybe a little bit of a headache sometimes, kinda dull, in the back of my head. It comes and goes, though. It's not a bad headache, just… there.
DOCTOR: “A little more thirsty… dull headache…” Ms. Fabing, do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? My grandma, on my mom's side… I think she had it. She was sick for a long time before she passed, and Mom always said it was the sugar. But that was a long time ago, and I don't really know much about it, to be honest. She lived back on the reservation, and we didn't see her much growing up. Is that… important? Should I have known more about that?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Fabing. Family history is significant. And it’s not about should have known, it’s about gathering information. Now, given your symptoms – the fatigue, increased thirst, headache – and the family history, we need to run some basic blood work to rule out diabetes. It’s a simple precaution. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven't had to take much medication in my life, thankfully. Just the usual over-the-counter stuff for colds, and nothing serious. So, blood work, huh? Okay. That’s… alright, I guess. Is it gonna take long? I got a job to get back to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard panel, Ms. Fabing. It will take approximately ten minutes for the blood draw itself. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back from the lab. While we wait, let's take your vitals. Please step onto the scale. And I’ll need a quick blood pressure reading.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Here we go... Hope I didn't have too much lunch. Just trying to keep my strength up for work, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. 70 kilograms. Blood pressure, please.
PATIENT: Okay. All right, I think that's done. Is everything okay? It felt a little tight, but I’m used to wearing work boots all day, so…
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. Not critically high, but something we need to monitor. Height, please.
PATIENT: Alright, let's see… I'm about 5’8”, I think. Maybe 5’8 and a half. I haven’t been measured in ages. Is that all? Are we almost done? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing. Based on your symptoms, family history, and these initial vitals, I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel to assess your blood sugar, kidney function, and cholesterol levels. I also want to rule out any underlying issues contributing to your fatigue and headache. We’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, likely in a week. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your water intake, even beyond what you're already doing, and prioritizing rest when possible. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Wow, okay. That’s a lot. A week… that’s alright, I guess. I just… I don't want it to be anything serious. I got a job to do, you know? Increasing water… okay, I can do that. Rest… that's the hard part. Um… Will these tests tell me if it's just stress, or something else? And will they keep me from working? I really need to know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, it's premature to speculate about the cause of your symptoms. These tests are to determine the cause, not to confirm a diagnosis before they're even completed. And as for working, the tests themselves will not prevent you from working. However, depending on the results, we may need to discuss temporary modifications to your work schedule or activity level. I cannot provide a definitive answer until we have the lab results. Let's focus on getting the tests done first. The lab requisition is being sent electronically to the lab across the street. You should be able to go immediately after you leave here. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: Electronic… okay. Across the street. Good. No… I think that’s everything. Just… try not to worry too much, right? I gotta get back to work. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checking me out.
DOCTOR: "Try" is the operative word, Ms. Fabing. Follow up in one week. The nurse will schedule the appointment as you check out. Have a productive day. .
