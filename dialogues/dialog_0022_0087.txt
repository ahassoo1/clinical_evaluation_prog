DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said, anyway. Medicare wants it done, I reckon. Honestly, I don't really remember what they want tested. It's all a bit of a blur these days. Can we just… get it over with?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. It's very common to get a little lost in all the paperwork and appointments. No problem at all, we can definitely figure it out. To help me get a better idea of what your Medicare plan is requesting, do you happen to have any documentation from them – a letter, perhaps, or a list of tests?
PATIENT: Documentation… hmm. I think I had something… a paper somewhere. No, wait. Maybe it was my son, Omar, who had it. He usually handles this sort of thing. Honestly, I’m terrible with keeping track of these things. Is there a number I can call to find out what they need? I really don’t want to bother Omar if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly help you with that. Let's try a different approach then. Do you recall if this was related to a recent check-up, or a specific health concern?
PATIENT: A check-up… I… think so? I go to the doctor now and then, I suppose. It’s all a bit fuzzy. I work at the power plant, you see, and it’s… well, it's important to be checked up on when you’re dealing with all that… stuff. Electricity, you know? Maybe it was something they wanted? I really can’t say. Is there a way you can just… see what Medicare is asking for directly? I’d be much obliged.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. Let me access your Medicare information through our system. Just one moment… Okay, it appears you had a preventative health exam on July 15th, and this lab work is likely a follow-up to that. It looks like they are requesting a Complete Blood Count , a Basic Metabolic Panel , a Lipid Panel, and a PSA test. Does that ring any bells?
PATIENT: CBC… BMP… Lipid… PSA… No, sir, not a single one. Sounds like a whole lot of… letters. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying, but honestly, I’m drawing a blank. Is this going to be painful? I've always hated needles… Can we just get it done, and I can worry about what it's for later?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly proceed without going into too much detail if you prefer. It will involve a small blood draw – a quick pinch, and then it’s over. I'll explain briefly what each test checks as we go, but we can keep it simple. First, we'll draw blood for the Complete Blood Count, which tells us about the different types of cells in your blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And… explain it real simple, like you're talking to a child. I’m not good with… science words. The quicker we finish, the better. Where do I sit?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat right here. We’ll just need to expose your arm for a moment. The Complete Blood Count, or CBC, basically tells us if you have enough of the right kinds of blood cells. It helps us see if anything is going on with your overall health, like if you have an infection or if you’re feeling tired for a reason. It’s a very common test. I'm just going to clean the area and then use a small needle to take a little bit of blood. It’ll only take a few seconds. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. I really don't like this. And… don’t poke too hard, alright? I bruise easily. Is this going to hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It will be a quick pinch, and then you won't even feel it. I'll use a small needle, and I always aim for a smooth, quick insertion. We’ll try to minimize any bruising. Just take a few deep breaths for me. This will help you relax. Here we go… All done. See?
PATIENT: Oof! That wasn’t so bad, I suppose. Is it… bleeding a lot? I told you I bruise easily! Just… put a big bandage on it. And… what's next? More needles? I'm starting to feel faint.
DOCTOR: It’s a very small amount of bleeding, Mr. Croonquist, completely normal. And yes, we’ll definitely put a larger bandage on it. There, how is that?
PATIENT: Better, I suppose. But… how much more is there? You said something about a “basic metabolic panel” and… whatever the other one was. Look, Doctor, if this is going to be a long ordeal, just tell me. I can always come back another day. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit dizzy.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Croonquist. We still have two more tests. The Basic Metabolic Panel checks your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. It just requires another small blood draw. The Lipid Panel checks your cholesterol levels, and the PSA test is to screen for prostate health. The PSA is a separate draw. All together, it'll be three more small blood draws. Would you like to take a short break before we continue?
PATIENT: Three more? Oh, good heavens. No, no break. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can forget about this whole mess. But… can you at least try to be extra gentle this time? And maybe… distract me? Tell me a joke or something. Anything to take my mind off it. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I will do my best to be as gentle as possible and will certainly try to distract you. Let me see… okay, here's a joke. Why don’t scientists trust atoms?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Get on with it. And… quicker, please. I’m starting to sweat. Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Because they make up everything! And now, for the Basic Metabolic Panel. This one checks how well your kidneys are working and your blood sugar level. It's another quick pinch, just like the first one. All done. See?
PATIENT: That wasn't too bad. Still… unsettling. Your jokes are terrible, Doctor. How many more needles are there? I swear, I'm starting to feel lightheaded. Do you have any water? Or maybe some juice? This whole thing is dreadful.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, I apologize for the terrible joke! And you are absolutely right to ask for water. I will get you some right away. But before I do, just one more blood draw, for the Lipid Panel and the PSA. It's important to finish the tests, so we can get a full picture of your health. This one will check your cholesterol levels and screen for prostate health. I promise, this will be the last one. We'll get you water and you can sit for a bit after this.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly. Don't talk. Don't make jokes. Just… do it. And for goodness sake, be gentle! I'm starting to see spots.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. Small pinch… almost done… there we are. All finished. Here you are. Please, take a few sips and relax for a moment. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… finally. A bit shaky, but… alright, I think. That was… dreadful. Truly dreadful. Will I get a bill for this torture? And… how long before I can go home? I just want to lie down.
DOCTOR: You certainly deserve to rest, Mr. Croonquist. And I completely understand. Yes, there will be a bill, but we’ll submit it to Medicare, and they will cover most of the costs. As for going home, you can leave whenever you feel up to it. Just avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day. We’ll send the lab results to your primary care physician, who will contact you with the findings. I’ll also have a nurse come in to check on you before you leave. Is there anything else I can get for you before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s everything. Just… please, don’t ever ask me to do that again. And tell whoever comes up with these tests they’re monsters. I just want to go home and forget this ever happened. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. I completely understand. It was certainly a lot, and I’m glad we got through it. I'll make sure a nurse checks on you before you go. And I'll pass along your feedback about the tests. Please, take care of yourself, and get some rest. If you experience any bleeding or unusual discomfort, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Have a good day, Mr. Croonquist.
PATIENT: .
