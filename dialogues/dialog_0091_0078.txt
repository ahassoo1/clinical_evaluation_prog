DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, or a jumpstart, as I told the receptionist. I haven't been feeling quite right for a while now, and I’m hoping you can help me figure out what that means. It’s hard to explain exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Not feeling quite right” is a common presentation, and we’ll certainly work together to understand what’s going on. It is often difficult to articulate. To help me get a clearer picture, could you elaborate on what you mean by “stuck”?
PATIENT: It’s…a lack of energy, mostly. Not constantly exhausted, but just…drained. And a bit of a mental fog. Things that used to be easy feel…harder. I used to be very active, very involved in things, and now…I find myself wanting to rest more, and not having the motivation for much else, honestly. It's not depression, I don't think so, just…less of everything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. Pitzel. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant decrease in your usual energy levels and motivation. We’ll explore this thoroughly. To start, could you tell me approximately when you first began noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden. Probably…around six months ago, maybe? It started gradually. I thought it was just stress at first, a busy period at work, things like that. But it hasn’t really gone away, even after things calmed down. It's…persisted. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. Is six months a long time to feel this way?
DOCTOR: Six months is certainly enough time to warrant a closer look, Ms. Pitzel. It's good you're bringing this to our attention now. To help me understand the scope of these symptoms, let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns—difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or perhaps sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s…irregular. Some nights I have no trouble at all, sleep soundly. Other nights I toss and turn for hours, can’t seem to quiet my mind. And then there are nights where I wake up very early and just…can’t get back to sleep. It’s not every night, but it’s frequent enough to be noticeable, definitely. I haven’t been sleeping too much, though. Just…inconsistent.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Pitzel. Inconsistent sleep can certainly contribute to these feelings. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight—either a loss of appetite, increased appetite, or unintentional weight gain or loss?
PATIENT: A little, yes. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t really crave anything, and sometimes I have to remind myself to eat. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes feel…looser, I suppose. It’s not a dramatic change, but I’ve noticed. Nothing intentional, certainly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you noticed any muscle aches, joint pain, or any unexplained fatigue beyond what we've already discussed?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit of muscle ache, mostly in my shoulders and back. I attributed it to…well, I spend a lot of time working with my hands, shaping things. It’s part of the job. But it’s been more persistent lately, even after a good night’s sleep, or a day off. No joint pain, though. And the fatigue…it's not like I'm exhausted all the time, just…drained, as I said before. It’s hard to explain. It's not a physical exhaustion, so much as…mental.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Pitzel. It sounds like you are experiencing a constellation of symptoms - decreased energy, mental fog, inconsistent sleep, changes in appetite, and some muscle discomfort. Let’s move on to some other areas. Have you been experiencing any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No headaches, no dizziness, and my vision is just fine. I did need new glasses last year, but that was a routine check-up. Nothing unusual there. I haven’t noticed anything different with my sight at all. So at least that’s one thing I don’t have to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Pitzel. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits—constipation, diarrhea, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A little bit of constipation, to be honest. Not severe, but…irregular. I haven’t changed my diet, so I wasn’t sure what was causing it. It’s not constant, but it’s been happening more frequently lately. No abdominal pain, though. Just…difficulties. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Pitzel. Changes in bowel habits can accompany a variety of things. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve always been quite healthy, if I may say so myself. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no heart disease. I have a family history of arthritis, but I haven’t experienced any symptoms myself. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. I had chickenpox as a child, and I’ve had the flu a few times, but nothing serious. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pitzel. That’s helpful information. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid those, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was very young, but that was…a very long time ago. It was a routine procedure, and I recovered quickly. Nothing else, though. I'm usually very careful to avoid getting sick or injured.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's discuss any medications you are currently taking, besides the multivitamin. This includes prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and any herbal supplements.
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, Doctor. I don’t take any prescription medications, and I very rarely take over-the-counter drugs. If I have a headache, I’ll take an ibuprofen occasionally, but that’s about it. And no herbal supplements, no. I prefer to stick to a healthy diet and regular exercise. Although…my neighbor recommended a chamomile tea for sleep. I've had a cup or two, but I wouldn’t say it’s made a significant difference.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pitzel. That’s good to know. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or food, and I don’t have any environmental allergies, like pollen or dust. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. That’s one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you for providing such a thorough history. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also within the normal range. Your temperature is 98.6°F, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Throat appears clear, no signs of redness or swelling. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal in appearance. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Now, based on the history and exam, I’d like to order some basic blood work to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Specifically, I'd like to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I’m happy to undergo. I trust your expertise. Blood work sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m eager to get to the bottom of this and feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will have the lab technician draw a few vials of blood from you. They'll send the results to me, and I will review them as soon as they become available. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. If your symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and you've explained everything very clearly. I feel much more reassured knowing we’re taking these steps. I’ll await the results, and I will contact the clinic if anything changes. Thank you very much for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I understand it can be unsettling when you’re not feeling your best, and I'm glad I could provide some clarity. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything concerns you.
PATIENT: .
