DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom, you see. It’s just… difficult to start, and then it doesn't all come out at once, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty starting and incomplete emptying – that's helpful to know. It sounds like you’re experiencing some urinary symptoms. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started… oh, maybe a month or so ago? It wasn’t sudden, it just… gradually got worse. At first, I just thought I was drinking too much tea before bed, but it hasn’t gotten better with less tea, unfortunately. It's been pretty consistent for the last couple of weeks, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset over about a month, consistent for the past couple of weeks despite reducing your tea intake. Thank you. And besides the difficulty starting and incomplete emptying, have you noticed any other changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sometimes… it feels like I have to go very suddenly. Like, I don't have much warning. And… sometimes it burns a little when I go. Not every time, but often enough that I noticed it. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's definitely important to know, Kandy. The sudden urge to urinate and the burning sensation are both key symptoms. Do you have any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back aches sometimes, but that's just my age, I think. I do a lot of gardening. My lower abdomen feels… normal, I guess. No pain there. Just the trouble with the urination, and the burning.
DOCTOR: Okay, no lower abdominal pain, and you attribute the back ache to gardening. Thank you. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… it has been a little cloudy, sometimes. And the smell… well, it doesn’t smell as fresh as it used to, if you know what I mean. I drink plenty of water, so I was surprised when I noticed that. Is that… bad? I’m sorry if I’m being silly.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being silly at all, Kandy. It’s good that you’re paying attention to these details. Cloudy urine and a change in smell can be important clues. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with medication for a long time. The doctor said it was just age-related. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I do take some vitamins, but that's it. I have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of controlled high blood pressure, and currently taking vitamins. And you're covered by Medicare. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago. That was all fine, no problems from that. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago too. Other than that, no, nothing major. I haven't been sick enough to be hospitalized in years. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can!
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago and a broken wrist in the past. Thank you. And regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as kidney problems, bladder cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my brother… he had some kind of prostate problem when he got older, but I don’t know exactly what it was. He didn't talk much about it. As far as I know, no kidney problems or bladder cancer in the family. Everyone lived to a pretty good age, actually. Lithuanian genes, maybe!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes and a brother with a prostate problem. Thank you. Now, let's talk about your daily habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I don't smoke, and I haven't had a drink in… well, decades. Not for me, thank you. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a simple woman, Doctor. Tea and gardening, that’s about it!
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, just one last set of questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My doctor used to tease me about being able to eat anything. I’ve tried lots of different foods over the years, and never had a problem. I don't wear any fancy jewelry or anything like that either, so no metal allergies. I think I'm pretty allergy-free, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. Thank you, Kandy, that gives me a really good understanding of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to do a quick urine test to check for infection. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… odd, alright? I’m a little nervous about the urine test, but I suppose it has to be done. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I'll explain everything as we go. And don't worry about the urine test – it's very straightforward. If you could just change into this gown, and we'll get started. I'll step out and give you a few minutes privacy. Please call out when you're ready.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I'll call out when I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kandy, are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'm ready now. It's a bit chilly in here though!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, everything sounds good there – heart rate is regular and lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little pressure, maybe, but no pain. It feels… normal. Like you said, just pressure. It's a bit uncomfortable, but I suppose that's to be expected.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant tenderness. Now I’m going to press a little bit higher, just above your bladder. Any difference here?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. That’s a little bit more… sensitive. Not painful, exactly, but I can feel something there. Like a fullness, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It’s just different than the rest of my abdomen.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful. Now, let’s collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’d like you to try to collect a midstream sample. There are instructions on the counter. I’ll be right outside when you’re finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright. I remember doing this before, I think. I'll call out when I'm done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy, I'm back. Here's the sample. Thank you. I’m going to send this to the lab for analysis. We’ll check for infection, blood, and other abnormalities. It usually takes a few days to get the results. While we're waiting, I'm going to review everything we’ve discussed, and we can formulate a plan. Just a moment.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I'm a bit anxious, to be honest, but I'm glad I came in. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy. Based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary findings of the physical exam – some sensitivity over your suprapubic region – it sounds like you may have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, we need the lab results to confirm this. It’s also important to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as an overactive bladder or, less likely, a bladder obstruction. Your symptoms – difficulty starting urination, incomplete emptying, sudden urge to urinate, burning sensation, and cloudy urine – are all consistent with a UTI. For now, while we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend increasing your fluid intake significantly – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. If you develop a fever, chills, or back pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. These could indicate a more serious kidney infection. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. A UTI… I’ve heard of those. Drinking more water, avoiding caffeine… I can do that. The fever and chills… that’s a bit scary, but I’ll keep an eye out. Would antibiotics be necessary if it is a UTI? I don’t like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it. And what about the overactive bladder you mentioned? What would that feel like? Is it common? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Kandy, those are all very good questions. Yes, if the lab results confirm a UTI, you’ll likely need a course of antibiotics. The length of treatment depends on the severity of the infection, but it’s usually around three to seven days. I understand your concern about taking pills, and we'll choose the antibiotic with the fewest side effects possible. An overactive bladder is when your bladder muscles contract involuntarily, causing a sudden urge to urinate, even when your bladder isn't full. It often feels like you have to rush to the bathroom, and you may experience frequent urination throughout the day and night. It’s fairly common, especially as we get older, and can often be managed with lifestyle changes, medication, or bladder training exercises. However, we need to determine the cause of your symptoms before we can proceed with any treatment plan. The lab results will be crucial in helping us make that determination. In the meantime, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a urinalysis. If the urinalysis is inconclusive, we may need to consider further testing, such as a bladder scan or an ultrasound. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s helpful. So, wait for the tests, drink more water, watch for fever… and then we’ll see. Bladder scan and ultrasound… that sounds a bit scary, but I trust your judgment. Would cranberry juice help? I’ve heard people say that cranberry juice is good for UTIs. And is there anything else I can do to prevent this from happening again? I don’t want to keep coming back here if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question about cranberry juice, Kandy. There’s some evidence that cranberry juice can help prevent UTIs by preventing bacteria from sticking to the bladder walls, but the evidence is mixed. It’s unlikely to treat an existing infection, but it may help prevent future ones. Just be aware that many cranberry juice products are high in sugar, so it’s best to choose unsweetened varieties. To prevent future UTIs, there are several things you can do: Drink plenty of fluids: As we've discussed. Urinate frequently: Don’t hold your urine for long periods of time. Wipe from front to back after using the toilet: This helps prevent bacteria from spreading from the rectum to the urethra. Empty your bladder after intercourse: This helps flush out any bacteria that may have entered the urethra. Avoid irritating feminine products: Such as douches, sprays, and powders. We can also discuss pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, which can strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra. I'll send the lab orders to the front desk, and they’ll schedule the tests for you. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to discuss the findings and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes sense. Drink water, wipe the right way, empty after… everything. It sounds like a lot of work, but I’ll try my best. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. I’ll just wait for the call. And I’ll try to drink more water. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or if you have any questions or concerns. Please take care, and have a good day.
