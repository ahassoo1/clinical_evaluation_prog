DOCTOR: Hi Erle, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, the doctor. Amussen, you said? Well, frankly, I haven’t the time for lengthy explanations. It’s this… this job. The students. Honestly, the lack of respect is appalling. It’s… stressful. Terribly stressful. I suppose that’s what they call it these days, isn’t it? Burnout? Though I hardly think that captures the… the nuance of the situation.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot at work, and that stress is impacting you. We can definitely talk about that. When you say it’s impacting you, can you tell me a little more about how it's affecting you?
PATIENT: Affecting me? Goodness. Where to begin? I find myself… irritable. Snapping at colleagues. And… and I sleep poorly. Though that could be the mattress, frankly. It’s terribly old. And… well, I simply haven’t the energy for… for hobbies. I used to enjoy philately, you know. Stamp collecting. But now? It seems… pointless. It’s just… draining. Everything is draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, so irritability, trouble sleeping, and feeling generally drained and less interested in things you used to enjoy. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Building up, certainly. Though pinpointing when precisely… that’s difficult. The students have been… problematic for quite some time, really. Years. It’s not as if it happened overnight. Though, perhaps… perhaps it worsened this past semester. A particularly… unruly class. A dreadful lot of entitlement, I assure you. Honestly, the youth of today…
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual process, with things possibly getting worse recently with this semester’s class. Besides the irritability, sleep issues, and loss of enjoyment, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. My appetite… yes, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I find myself skipping meals. Though, truthfully, the food these days… it’s all terribly processed. Not like the food my mother used to make. And… and I’ve been rather forgetful, I must admit. Names, dates… little things. Though I’m 87, you know. One can hardly expect a perfect memory at my age. It’s… natural.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite and some forgetfulness. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, goodness. I haven’t weighed myself in… well, I can’t recall precisely. I suppose I’ve lost some. My clothes feel a little… looser, perhaps. But I wouldn’t say it’s drastic. I’m naturally slender, you see. Always have been. Though, I should really get a new mattress. That might explain a great deal, you know. It’s terribly uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a broader picture, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What sort of symptoms? Are you suggesting I'm… ill? I assure you, I'm perfectly healthy for my age. A little tired, perhaps. And forgetful, naturally. But that’s simply… life. Do you mean aches and pains? A little stiffness in the mornings, but nothing a bit of movement doesn’t cure. Honestly, I’ve always prided myself on my resilience.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know about the stiffness. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Good heavens. Is this really necessary? I mean, I'm here because of stress, not… not digestive complaints! Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive. I suppose they’re all the same, these doctors. Always poking and prodding. It’s undignified.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Erle. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of your health to understand what might be contributing to your stress and fatigue. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical issues. Let’s move on to something else then. Have you noticed any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? No, no palpitations. I assure you, my heart is perfectly sound. Though… now that you mention it, I did feel a little… breathless climbing the stairs yesterday. But that was simply because I rushed. I have a luncheon to attend, you see. A rather important gathering. Honestly, I haven’t the time for ailments. I have a life to live! And I'm running late, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're busy. Let me just quickly check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few moments. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but otherwise everything sounds okay. I’m going to listen to your heart a little more closely.
PATIENT: Listen to my heart? Again? Honestly, doctor, this is becoming rather tedious. I told you, my heart is perfectly fine. I have a very strong constitution. Perhaps if I had a better mattress, I wouldn’t be feeling so… agitated. And I really must be going. This luncheon… it’s terribly important. With the historical society, you see. We’re discussing… well, it doesn’t matter. The point is, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Erle. I'm just trying to be thorough. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but it's something we should investigate further. It could be related to your age, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Given your reported stress, fatigue, decreased appetite, and some forgetfulness, along with the murmur I’m hearing, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels, and an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, doctor, this is preposterous! I came here because I’m stressed, not because I’m falling apart! Blood tests, EKGs… it’s all rather… dramatic, isn’t it? I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of managing my own health. I’ve lived 87 years without needing all this… this machinery. Frankly, I think a good rest and a new mattress would do wonders. And perhaps a less intrusive doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Erle. You’re right, you’ve managed well for a long time. Perhaps we can start with something simpler. How about we focus on managing your stress?
PATIENT: Now that’s sensible. Stress management. Yes, that’s what I need. Though frankly, avoiding unruly students is the best stress management of all. Perhaps they could implement stricter disciplinary measures… Honestly, the youth of today… But yes, stress management. Do you have any… suggestions? Something that doesn't involve needles or machinery, preferably. And quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. There are a few things we can try. Simple things like regular gentle exercise – a short walk each day can make a big difference. Also, mindfulness techniques, like deep breathing exercises, can help calm your mind. And ensuring you’re getting enough sleep – even if it means addressing the mattress situation – is crucial. We also have resources for social support groups if you’d like to connect with others. Would you be interested in learning more about any of those options?
PATIENT: Social support groups? Good heavens, no. I prefer my own company, thank you very much. Walking… perhaps. If the weather is amenable. And deep breathing… well, I suppose it couldn’t hurt. But honestly, the most effective solution would be to retire. To simply… remove myself from the situation. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: Retirement is certainly an option to consider, Erle, if it's feasible for you. It sounds like it would significantly reduce your stress levels. For now, let's focus on the things we can do immediately. I'll give you a handout with some information on deep breathing exercises and gentle stretching. I'll also write down some resources for local walking groups, in case you decide to try that. And if you find your stress is not improving, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Handouts… very well. As long as they don't require me to fill out complicated forms. And walking groups… I’ll consider it. Though I make no promises. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here today. I really must be going. Thank you, doctor. Though I suspect a new mattress would be far more beneficial than anything else.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Yes, well. Goodbye, doctor. And thank you again. Though I still maintain that this entire experience has been rather… unnecessary. .
