DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Komarov, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Arbin Komarov. Good to meet you, Doctor… Murtic, right? I think I read your name on the door.
DOCTOR: Yes, Murtic. Dr. Milan Murtic. Let’s not dwell on pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry! Right, yes. It’s… well, the sun’s been bothering me. Not like a sunburn, exactly. More like… everything’s just too bright. It started a few months back, and it’s getting worse. It makes my eyes really uncomfortable, and sometimes gives me a headache.
DOCTOR: "Too bright," you say. Months back. And headaches. Hmm. We'll get to the bottom of it. First, let’s try to be precise. Is it all light that bothers you, or is it specifically sunlight?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think… mostly sunlight. Fluorescent lights in the store aren't great, but they don't bother me nearly as much. It's definitely worse when I’m outside, especially on really clear days. Even with sunglasses, sometimes it feels like too much.
DOCTOR: Sunglasses help… somewhat. That's… useful information, I suppose. Have you noticed any changes in your vision other than the brightness sensitivity?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything looks normal, as far as I can tell. No blurriness, no spots, nothing like that. Just… the light feels really intense. It’s hard to explain. It's not like pain, exactly… more like a strain. Like I’m squinting all the time, even when I'm not.
DOCTOR: Squinting… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. Let me think. Not… drastically, no. My wife, God rest her soul, passed away last year, so things have been… different, generally. But nothing specific that I can point to right before this started. Maybe a bit more time outdoors, now that I’m… well, keeping busy. I started a little garden. But it wasn't a huge change.
DOCTOR: A recent loss… I see. And you’ve increased your outdoor activity. Alright. Let's move on to other things, then. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual aches and pains for a man my age. I've got Medicare, so they keep a pretty good record of things. High blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. And a little arthritis in my knees, but nothing debilitating. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy for my age, all things considered. I used to be a carpenter, so I stayed active, you know?
DOCTOR: “Pretty healthy.” Right. We’ll see what the records say. High blood pressure, managed. Arthritis. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. Never needed any. Just a few broken bones when I was a kid, but they healed up fine. I was always climbing trees and getting into mischief. My wife used to say I had nine lives! It feels like a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Good. Any medications you’re currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes a little ibuprofen for my knees if they're acting up, but that's it. Nothing regular, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! I don't think so. Nothing I've ever been officially diagnosed with, anyway. I get a little sniffly sometimes during the spring, but I always figured that was just the dust. Never anything serious enough to see a doctor about.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look at your eyes, then. I need to examine them. Please sit up straight and look forward. I will dim the lights for the examination.
PATIENT: Sounds good. I can do that. Sit up straight, look forward... no problem. Dim the lights whenever you're ready. Let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light… no obvious abnormalities there. Fundi appear normal, no hemorrhages or exudates. I'm checking your reflexes... and your extraocular movements. They're a little sluggish, actually. Not dramatically so, but… noticeable. And your blink reflex is slightly reduced. Tell me, have you noticed any dryness in your eyes?
PATIENT: Dryness? Hmm... not really. Not that I've noticed, anyway. They sometimes feel a little tired at the end of the day, but I figured that was just from staring at the computer too long. Or maybe from being outside. I can't say I've consciously thought about them being dry. Is that a bad sign? Should I be using eye drops? I've never had to do anything like that before.
DOCTOR: "Tired"... Right. It's unlikely to be a serious problem, but we need to rule things out. It could be related to the sluggish reflexes and reduced blink reflex, or simply eye strain. We'll get some baseline measurements, just to be sure. I'm going to order a Schirmer test and a tear film breakup time test. It’s just a quick assessment of your tear production and quality. And a visual field test. Just routine. In the meantime, I recommend artificial tears, preservative-free. Use them as needed, four times a day. They won’t cure anything, but they might alleviate some of the discomfort. The nurse will schedule you for these tests. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, Schirmer test, tear film thing… sounds complicated. Artificial tears, four times a day… I can manage that. Preservative-free, right? Just to be sure. Is this something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? My wife… well, I just want to make sure it's nothing too bad. And what about the visual field test? What are you looking for with that one?
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, please. It is highly unlikely to be anything serious. It’s most probably a combination of age-related changes, eye strain, and potentially a mild decrease in tear production. The visual field test is simply to assess your peripheral vision. It helps us identify any subtle deficits that might indicate a neurological issue, but again, it's routine. We are being thorough. The tests will give us a clearer picture, and allow us to rule things out. Worrying will not help. The nurse will explain the test procedures in detail. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You're right, worrying won't help. It's just… hard not to, sometimes. No, I don't think so. Just the tests, then. And the nurse will explain everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. And for being thorough. I'll see the nurse, then?
DOCTOR: Yes. The nurse is just outside. She'll get you set up. And please, try to relax. It’s probably nothing. .
PATIENT: .
