DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sadhu. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Donate, it’s this cough. It just won’t quit. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a month now, I’d say. And it feels… deep, you know? Not like a cold cough. It makes my chest feel tight, and I get so winded just walking to the kitchen. My heart… well, you know about my heart. It doesn't help, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a little over a month, I think. Started right after that heat wave we had. I thought it was just the change in weather at first, but it hasn’t let up. I’ve tried cough drops, a little honey in my tea… nothing seems to really touch it. It’s worse at night, keeps me up.
DOCTOR: And you said it feels deep?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not like something in my throat, more… down in my chest. It feels like something is rattling around, and it hurts when I really cough hard. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… ache, all over my chest. And like I said, it makes it hard to breathe sometimes. I have to stop and catch my breath just getting the mail. It’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned a history of heart issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A long history. Congestive heart failure, the doctor told me years ago. I see Dr. Ramirez for that, he's a good man. Takes care of me. I take my water pills every day, and a couple of others… I can’t remember the names right offhand, but I have all my medications at home. It just feels like… this cough is making the heart trouble worse, if you know what I mean. I get more swollen ankles when it’s bad, and I’m just… tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles, you say. Alright. Let's get a better picture of things. Now, have you had a fever at all with this cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I check myself in the mornings, just to be sure, and nothing. Just the cough, the chest ache, and the tiredness. And the ankles swelling up like balloons when I’ve had a really bad coughing fit. It's just… a lot. I used to be so active, even after the heart trouble. Now, I feel like I can barely walk across the room without getting winded.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any changes in your mucus?
PATIENT: Mucus? Well… yes, actually. It started out clear, just a little tickle. But now it’s… thicker, and yellowish. Not a lot of it, but when I do cough some up, it’s definitely not clear anymore. I haven’t noticed any blood in it, thankfully. It just… feels like there’s something stuck in my chest, and that’s what comes out when I cough. It doesn't smell or taste bad, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked for a while, but I always made him go outside. Bad for the health, you know? And I’ve always been careful about staying healthy, even with the heart trouble. I eat my vegetables, I drink plenty of water… I just don’t understand why this is happening. It’s worrying me something fierce.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a listen to your lungs, see what we're dealing with. Please, take a deep breath for me when I tell you.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready. Just tell me when to breathe. I hope it's not anything too serious. It's just... getting harder and harder to do anything, and I don't want to end up in the hospital again. That wasn't a pleasant experience.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath... and exhale. Again... good. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, Ms. Sadhu. And some crackling sounds as well. It doesn't sound good. It could be bronchitis, or pneumonia, maybe even some fluid buildup from your heart condition. We need to rule some things out.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Pneumonia? That sounds… serious. Fluid buildup from my heart, you say? Is that why I’m so swollen? And why it’s so hard to breathe? I was hoping it was just a bad cold. What do we need to do, Doctor? Do I need a chest X-ray? I don’t mind the tests, as long as we can figure out what’s wrong and get me feeling better. This cough is just wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sadhu, we absolutely need a chest X-ray. And I'm going to order some blood work as well, to check for infection and assess your kidney function. We'll also check your oxygen levels. Given your history of heart failure and the sounds I'm hearing, we need to rule out any worsening of that. The X-ray will help us see if there’s fluid in your lungs. And the blood work will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Now, I'm also going to prescribe you an inhaler to help open up your airways. It won’t cure anything, but it should help with the wheezing and make it easier to breathe. And I want you to promise me, if you start feeling really short of breath, or if you develop a fever, you go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. X-ray, blood work, inhaler… and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I can do that. I’ll try not to panic, but it’s just… scary when you don’t know what’s wrong. And my heart… it’s always been a worry. Is this a sign that it’s getting worse? I trust you, Doctor, you’re a good doctor, but it’s hard not to worry. I’ll get the tests done right away. Where do I go for the X-ray and blood work? And will someone call me with the results?
DOCTOR: Here. This form has the directions to the imaging center for the X-ray, and the lab for the blood work. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours, and the imaging center will send the X-ray report directly to me. My office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once I have the results. Now, Ms. Sadhu, I understand you're worried, but try to stay calm. We're being thorough, and that's the most important thing. And yes, the symptoms could be related to your heart condition, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… try to stay calm, get the tests done, and wait for the results. I can do that. Thank you for seeing me so quickly. It's a relief to know someone is taking a look at this. I appreciate it. I'll go get those tests done right away. And I’ll remember to go to the emergency room if I get worse. I promise. Is there anything else I need to know before I leave? Any warning signs I should be especially aware of?
DOCTOR: Just the shortness of breath, and a fever. Any chest pain, and go immediately. Don't try to ride it out. And try to get some rest, Ms. Sadhu. That’s always good advice. Alright, next patient. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Shortness of breath, fever, chest pain… go immediately. I'll remember that. Thank you again.
