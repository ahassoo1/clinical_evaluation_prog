DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. It’s… my hands. They shake. Been shaking for a while now. Not a big deal, really. Just annoying.
DOCTOR: "Annoying," you say. Alright. And how long exactly has this been going on, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. Time… it all blurs together, doesn’t it? I really don’t keep track of these things. It just… started. Nothing dramatic. It’s not like I fell or anything. Just a little tremor. My daughter keeps telling me to come in, says it’s “important.” Honestly, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to get it checked out. “A little tremor” can be caused by many things, and it is best to rule out anything serious. Now, is this tremor constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when I’m trying to… do something. Like, holding a fork, or… you know, signing something. Used to be a big deal, signing things. Directed a lot of pictures back in the day. Not so much anymore. It’s… harder to get things done now. Honestly, it's probably just old age. Everything’s falling apart, one way or another.
DOCTOR: "Falling apart," you say. Well, we'll see about that. Does anything specifically make it worse – stress, caffeine, certain times of day?
PATIENT: Caffeine? Heavens no. I haven't touched that stuff in decades. Stress... well, who doesn't have stress? Running a film set... that was stressful. Now? Not so much. Just… frustrating. It's worse when I'm trying to be precise, I guess. Like, writing a check. Or… I don’t know. Things that require a steady hand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does it affect both hands equally, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm. Good question. Let me think… The right one, I think. Yeah, the right one shakes more. Not dramatically, mind you. It's not like it's… flapping around. Just a little more noticeable. Honestly, it's probably just nerves. I used to be so steady. Used to build model ships as a boy… very intricate work. Everything goes, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I… I don't know. I feel a little tired, sometimes. But that's just… being old. And my knees bother me, but that's the arthritis. What kind of symptoms are you thinking of? Look, I’m not a complicated case, you know. Just my hands shake.
DOCTOR: I understand you feel it’s a simple issue, Mr. Baide, but it’s my job to be thorough. I need to ask about other potential symptoms to rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any stiffness or slowness in your movements?
PATIENT: Stiffness? No, not really. I mean, I creak a bit in the morning, but that's just… old age. Slowness? Well, maybe. I don't move as fast as I used to. But who does? I don't go running marathons anymore, you know. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Are we going to do something about the shaking or are you just going to interrogate me about my general state of decline?
DOCTOR: I assure you, I’m not attempting to interrogate you, Mr. Baide. I’m simply gathering information. Let's move on. Have you experienced any changes in your speech, like slurring or difficulty finding words?
PATIENT: Speech? No! I'm perfectly clear, aren't I? I used to be a director, for goodness sake. Had to give instructions to dozens of people! I don't slur. My daughter… well, she thinks I repeat myself sometimes, but that's just because she doesn't listen properly. Look, I'm a perfectly functional human being. Just a little shaky. Can we please get to the point? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical and neurological examination. I'd like to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. It will only take a few minutes, and it will help me determine the potential cause of your tremor. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The quicker we do this, the quicker I can go home. Don't expect miracles, though. I'm 80 years old, you know. Things aren’t going to be like they used to be. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax. First, I'm going to check your vital signs. Then, I'll assess your reflexes. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Blood pressure is 148/82. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, please extend your arms in front of you with your palms up. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, could you try to tap your finger to your nose repeatedly with both hands?
PATIENT: Fine. Done. Honestly, this is… …irritating. See? Shaky. What did you expect? I told you. Now can we be finished? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've observed the tremor and noted the difficulty with finger-to-nose testing. Based on the examination, and your history, the most likely possibility is essential tremor. However, given your age, and to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us assess your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the shaking. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, for goodness sake. More tests? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Look, I’ve lived a long life. I’m 80 years old. If I have some kind of “essential tremor”, so be it. I don’t need a bunch of blood tests to tell me what I already know. No. I don’t want any blood work. I’m not doing it. Just… give me something for the shaking, if you have anything, and let me go home. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. While essential tremor is a common possibility, other conditions can mimic its symptoms, and it’s important to rule those out, especially given your age. I strongly recommend the blood work. It is a simple procedure, and it will provide valuable information to ensure I am providing you with the most appropriate care. If you refuse the blood work, I can offer you a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform additional tests and provide specialized treatment options. However, without further investigation, I am unable to prescribe any medication. I must prioritize your safety and well-being, and that requires a thorough assessment. Which course of action would you prefer: the blood work, or the referral to a neurologist?
