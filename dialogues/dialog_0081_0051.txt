DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what does bring me in? Let me see… It’s about my blood, I think. My… a friend suggested I find out what kind it is. Something about… in case of an emergency? It's all a bit fuzzy, you see. I just know it's important to know, and I haven’t a clue what type I am.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re interested in determining your blood type, primarily as a precautionary measure for potential emergencies. While knowing your blood type can be helpful in certain situations, it’s not typically a routine test unless there’s a specific medical reason. Still, we can certainly investigate that for you. Before we proceed, just to clarify, has a doctor ever mentioned your blood type before, perhaps during a previous hospitalization or blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a previous hospitalization… Now that’s a thought. Let me see… I’ve been in and out of hospitals a time or two, as you can imagine, at my age. But did they ever say anything about my blood type? I honestly can’t recall. It’s been… a long time. So many faces, so many tests… I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. No, I don’t think anyone ever told me specifically.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed as if this is new information, then. We can certainly order a blood type and Rh factor test. It's a simple blood draw. Before that though, just to get a more complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies to anything—medications, food, environmental factors, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… let me think. Yes, I take something for my… arthritis, I believe. A little white pill. And something for my blood pressure, a small pink one. That’s about it, I think. As for allergies… hmm… Well, I always scratch when I’m around cats. Is that an allergy? And I can’t eat shellfish, makes me terribly sick. Other than that, no, not that I can remember. It's funny, things just don't stick like they used to.
DOCTOR: Arthritis medication and blood pressure medication. And a reaction to shellfish and a sensitivity to cats. We’ll make sure to document those. Do you happen to know the names of the arthritis and blood pressure medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… the names… That’s a tricky one. They come in little bottles, you see. I have someone who fills them for me, my niece, Elena. She handles all that. I just take the pills she gives me. I think… the arthritis one is… something beginning with an ‘A’? And the blood pressure one… I really haven't a clue. I'm so sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. I just know they’re little pills, and they help, mostly.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mrs. Nini. We can work with this. We’ll note that you're taking an arthritis medication starting with ‘A’ and a blood pressure medication, and we’ll try to obtain more specific information from your niece, Elena, if possible. Now, regarding your overall health, have you had any significant medical conditions diagnosed in the past—heart problems, diabetes, lung issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh my… significant medical conditions… Let me see. Well, I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, quite a bad one. And my heart… the doctor said it was a little… fluttery sometimes, years ago. He put me on something, I don’t remember what, and it seemed to help. Diabetes… I don’t think so. Elena checks my sugar sometimes, and it's usually alright. I've always been rather thin, you see, so I don’t think it's that. It's all a bit of a blur, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, and seen a lot of doctors.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia in the past, and a history of heart palpitations. We’ll document that as well. Any surgeries, Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh dear. Let me think… Yes, I had my appendix out when I was very young, a long, long time ago. And… and I had a hip replacement, maybe ten years ago? It was quite painful for a while, but it's much better now. And… I think… I think I had something done on my eyes, a small procedure. Something to do with… cataracts? Yes, I think that’s it. It helped me see much clearer. That’s all I can recall, I believe. It's funny how the important things just fade, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy in the past, hip replacement approximately ten years ago, and cataract surgery. Alright. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Now that's a question. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had a bad heart in the end. And my brother… he had something with his stomach, cancer I think. A very sad business. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had diabetes. Yes, I remember that. He lost a toe, poor man. Other than that… I’m not really sure. We weren’t very close, you see. A big family, but not a very… connected one. It's all a bit hazy, Doctor. So many years.
DOCTOR: Heart disease in your mother, stomach cancer in your brother, and diabetes in your grandfather. That’s helpful to know. Finally, Mrs. Nini, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… well, I used to have a little glass of sherry with dinner sometimes, years ago. But I haven’t had a drink in… oh, must be twenty years or more. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! A respectable woman like myself would never! No, no, none of that. I always believed in a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet. Mostly. Though Elena does insist I have a little chocolate now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini. Thank you for providing me with that information. It gives me a good overall picture of your health history. Now, I think we can proceed with the blood draw to determine your blood type. After we get the results back, we can discuss them and ensure you have the necessary information in case of an emergency. Would you like to step into the examination room so I can perform a brief physical assessment and then order the blood work?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A physical assessment… yes, alright. That’s a good idea. And the blood work, of course. The sooner we know, the better, I suppose. Yes, let’s do it. Lead the way. I’m ready when you are. Though my knees are a bit creaky today, you understand. Slow and steady, that’s what I say!
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Nini. Slow and steady is perfectly fine. Just a quick exam, checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Nothing to worry about. Please, follow me.
