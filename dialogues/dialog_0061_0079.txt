DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Courtnye. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's about my bruising, really. It's just… been getting worse, and I'm on blood thinners, so it's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that's getting worse, especially while you’re on blood thinners – that is something we want to check out. Thanks for bringing that to my attention. First, can you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? Little bumps, you know, from just… knocking into things. Normal stuff. But now, even a little tap will leave a huge mark. And they’re staying around longer. Like, a week or more now, instead of a couple of days. It's mostly on my arms and legs, but I think I saw one starting on my stomach yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, started with minor bumps, now bruising more easily and lasting longer, and you're noticing it on your arms, legs, and now your stomach. That's helpful. And just to be clear, when you say “little tap,” can you give me an example of what you mean?
PATIENT: Hmm… like, if I bump into the corner of the table. Or even just… if my cat brushes against me a little too hard. It shouldn’t cause a bruise, you know? It’s just… a normal cat brush. It’s not like he’s attacking me or anything. It’s just… more than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumping into furniture or even a gentle brush from your cat is causing bruising now. That definitely sounds concerning. You mentioned you're on blood thinners. Do you know why you're taking them?
PATIENT: Yes. It was for a blood clot in my leg last year. The doctor said I needed to be on them for at least six months, and… well, I’m still on them. I think I have another appointment to talk about stopping soon, but… this bruising started before that appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blood clot in your leg last year, currently on blood thinners, and this bruising started before your upcoming appointment to discuss stopping them. Good to know. Let's talk a little more about the bruising itself. Are the bruises painful?
PATIENT: Some of them. The first couple of days, they’re pretty sore, like a really bad ache. Then it fades a bit, but they’re still… tender to the touch, you know? Not crippling pain or anything, but definitely noticeable. And they feel… warm, sometimes. Not always, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, they're sore for the first couple of days, then tender, and sometimes feel warm. That’s helpful. Now, let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any other medical problems besides the blood clot?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual. High blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. And… I had my gallbladder out a few years ago, but that was no big deal. Nothing else major, I don’t think. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. That's why this is so weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure controlled with medication and gallbladder removal. And generally good health otherwise. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Let's see… the blood thinner, of course. And the high blood pressure medication… Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once a month, if that. That’s it. I don’t really like taking pills, so I try to avoid it when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood thinner, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My mum always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Though… I do get a little itchy sometimes after eating shellfish, but I just figured I was sensitive to it, not actually allergic. It’s not a full-blown reaction, just a little bit of itching. I avoid shellfish now anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, just some mild itching with shellfish, which you avoid. Now, a couple of quick social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped when I started the blood thinners. My doctor said it wasn't a good idea. And I've never touched anything else. I’m a pretty boring person, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Last question about your history. Any family history of bleeding problems or easy bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… My grandfather on my mum’s side… he had some problems with bleeding gums when he got older, but that was just when he was really old. And my aunt… she had a really bad nosebleed once, but she’s always been a bit… dramatic, you know? Nothing serious, I don’t think. My mum didn't mention anything else when I talked to her about this. I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of bleeding gums and a single nosebleed, but nothing definitive. Alright, thank you for sharing all of that information, Courtnye. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a closer look at the bruising on your arms and legs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. The sooner we figure this out, the better, really. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at the bruising. Please point to where you’ve been noticing the bruising. I see bruising on both forearms, primarily on the outer sides. They range in size from about 2 to 5 centimeters. The color is a mix of purple and blue, which indicates they are relatively recent. They are tender to the touch, as you mentioned. And I see some smaller, lighter bruises on your lower legs, which appear to be older. There’s no swelling or warmth beyond the bruising itself. I don’t notice any other skin changes. Given your history of being on blood thinners, the recent increase in bruising, and the tenderness you described, I'm a little concerned. We need to get some blood work done to check your blood counts and clotting factors. I also want to rule out any other underlying causes for the bruising.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work? Is it… serious? Is something really wrong? I mean, I know I said it was worrying, but… I didn’t think it would need blood tests. What are we looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. It's good you're asking questions. Blood tests are just a precaution, to help us figure out exactly what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean something serious is wrong. We're going to check a complete blood count, or CBC, to see if you have enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Platelets are important for clotting, so we want to make sure yours are at a normal level. We’ll also check your clotting factors – these are proteins in your blood that help your blood clot properly. There are a few things we could be looking for. It could be that your blood thinner is working too well, which would explain the easy bruising. It could also be something else entirely, like a vitamin deficiency or, rarely, a more serious condition affecting your blood. But we need the tests to rule things out and get a clear picture. Do you have any allergies that we need to be aware of before we draw the blood?
PATIENT: No, like I said, no allergies. Okay. That makes a bit more sense, I guess. It’s just… I don't like needles, and it’s a bit scary thinking something could be wrong with my blood. But if you think it's important, then… okay. Where do we do the tests? And how long will it take to get the results? Will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns. Needles aren't fun for anyone. And it's natural to be worried when we're talking about your health. We'll get through this. We can do the blood draw right here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can make sure you’re comfortable. The results usually come back within 2-3 business days. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I’ll call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you notice any new or unusual symptoms – like bleeding from your nose, gums, or anywhere else, or if the bruising gets significantly worse – please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Okay. 2-3 business days. I’ll try not to worry too much until then. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I guess I’ll go and see the phlebotomist now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. That’s what I’m here for. And you're right to try not to worry too much. We're just gathering information at this point. Yes, please head to the lab and let them know you’re here for Dr. Kimm’s blood work order. They’ll take good care of you. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and will be in touch to schedule a follow-up. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns before then. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
