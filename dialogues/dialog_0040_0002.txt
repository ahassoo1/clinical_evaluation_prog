DOCTOR: Right. Zoie Stoffregen, 87. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… um. It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Not… not completely hard, you know? Just… takes a long time. And doesn’t… doesn’t come out strong like it used to. My husband, he helps me keep track of things… I forget sometimes if I even need to go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vague, very vague. Alright. So, difficulty with urination… a weak stream, and some…forgetfulness regarding the urge?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds right. Weak… yes. And… like I said, I forget. Sometimes I feel like I should go, but when I try… nothing. Or very little. It’s… embarrassing. I used to be so strong, you know? Could run all day. Now… now it’s this.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. A long time. Months, I think. Maybe longer? It… it came on slow. I didn’t really notice at first. My husband, he pointed it out. Said I was taking longer in the bathroom. He’s a good man, always watching out for me. I… I can’t really say when it started, exactly. A while.
DOCTOR: Months… okay. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain…? No, not really. Not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like… like it’s not finishing, you know? Like there’s still some left in there. And… a little bit of pushing sometimes. But not pain. No burning either. Just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating. Right. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. No fever. And chills… not that I know of. My husband would tell me if I had a fever, I think. He’s very good at noticing things. Abdominal… is that your tummy? No pain in my tummy. Everything feels… normal down there, except for the… you know. The bathroom part. It’s just old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh, um… let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take something for that too. A pink one. But that’s it, I think. My husband manages most of them, so I don’t always remember the names. He keeps them in a little box.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, occasional arthritis medication… I’ll check the records. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh… goodness. I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but nothing serious. My husband always asks when the doctor gives me something new. He’s very careful. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it sounds like we’re dealing with some urinary retention, possibly related to age and some weakening of the bladder muscles. We’ll need to do a quick exam to rule out anything more serious, and then we can discuss some options. Do you mind if I do a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Oh dear. What does that involve? I don't like doctors poking around. Is it… is it going to hurt? My husband always comes with me, but he's at the store getting groceries… I didn’t expect it to be… this much.
DOCTOR: It’s a simple exam, Mrs. Stoffregen. Just checking your abdomen, and a quick neurological assessment to see if there’s any nerve involvement. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, just a bit… invasive. We need to rule things out. It’s standard procedure. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we have to check. Do you consent to the exam?
PATIENT: Oh… neurological… Is that… brain stuff? I don't understand. And invasive…? My husband always says I shouldn't let them do things I don't understand. I… I don't know. Can’t we just get a pill? Something to help me go to the bathroom? I really don't like the sound of this exam. I think I’d rather wait for my husband. He always asks good questions.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Stoffregen, I understand you’re anxious, but we can’t just prescribe medication without a proper assessment. It's irresponsible. I’m going to have to reschedule your appointment until your husband is present. Perhaps he can help you better understand the process. Have a good day.
