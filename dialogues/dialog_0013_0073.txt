DOCTOR: Hi Triana, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been having trouble for weeks now. Diarrhea. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried… things. Over-the-counter stuff. It just keeps going. Honestly, it’s embarrassing even talking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is uncomfortable to talk about, but we need to get some details so we can figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. “Weeks now” is a bit vague – can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Roughly? Ugh. Maybe… six, seven weeks? Something like that. It comes and goes, but it's always there, simmering under the surface, you know? And then, BAM. It just… explodes. It's not a normal thing. I’ve never had anything like this before. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven weeks of intermittent diarrhea with occasional flare-ups. And you said it feels different than anything you've experienced before. Alright. To help me narrow things down, can you describe what the diarrhea looks like?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. You really need me to go into that detail? Fine. It’s… watery. Sometimes it’s just liquid, and other times there’s… stuff in it. Like, undigested food. And it's… well, it’s not a normal color, if that makes sense. Not… solid. Obviously. Look, I’m a painter, not a doctor. I deal with colors all day, but I don’t analyze what comes out of my body. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Watery, sometimes with undigested food, and not a normal color. Okay. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Mucus, maybe. Sometimes. It’s hard to tell, honestly. Everything’s just… a mess. Blood? I don’t think so. I would remember that, wouldn't I? I mean, that sounds… serious. If there was blood, I'd have gone to the emergency room. I haven’t seen anything bright red, anyway. This has just been… ongoing discomfort. Not a dramatic emergency. Just… annoying. And debilitating, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no bright red blood, possible mucus. And it’s been impacting your daily life. Good. That's important information. Now, have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain, yes. Cramping, mostly. It comes and goes with the… everything else. Not a constant pain, thankfully. Nausea sometimes, but I haven’t actually thrown up. And no fever. I’ve felt tired, run down, but that's probably from… everything. Honestly, it's just been a terrible summer. I just want to feel normal again. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: No, we're getting there. Just a few more questions, I promise. Okay, so cramping with the diarrhea, no vomiting, no fever, just fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite? Well, when your stomach is constantly trying to reject everything you eat, of course my appetite has changed! I’m eating smaller portions. Trying to stick to bland foods, you know? Toast, crackers… things that won’t… upset things further. It’s not like I’m enjoying a big steak right now. I've lost a few pounds, too, which isn't ideal. I'm already… slight.
DOCTOR: Okay, smaller portions, bland foods, and some weight loss. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history quickly. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was… ages ago. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I eat… well, I try to eat healthy. I was widowed a few years back, and, honestly, I just haven't been taking care of myself like I used to. Everything sort of… went downhill after that. But I don’t have any diabetes or anything like that. Just the gallbladder. And a general lack of… motivation. But that’s not a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's not a medical condition. Okay, gallbladder removal previously. And no other major medical issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. And, like I said, I've been trying different things for my stomach. Pepto-Bismol, Imodium… whatever the pharmacist recommended. Nothing seems to stay put, if you know what I mean. It all just… passes through. I don’t take any regular medications. Just trying to manage on my own, really. I don’t like going to doctors, if I’m honest. It never ends well.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen, over-the-counter remedies for the diarrhea with no lasting relief. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or food?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat… well, I eat everything. I’m Tlingit, you know? We eat a lot of salmon and seafood. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Aside from this… ongoing ordeal. Honestly, I just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it. Is this going to involve a lot of tests? I really don't have the energy for a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and I will order some stool samples to check for infection. It’s standard procedure for this kind of thing, and it's the fastest way to get some answers. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. Painting doesn’t do itself. But I swear, if this involves a colonoscopy, I’m walking out of here. Seriously. I just want some answers, not… an invasion of privacy. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. A colonoscopy isn’t the first step here, don't worry. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll check your vital signs. I’ll then send the stool samples to the lab. We’ll start with the basics. Okay, I’m listening now. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes. Right there. A little bit tender. It’s not… excruciating, but it’s definitely not comfortable. You’re poking around in there now, aren't you? Honestly, I don’t understand why you need to push so hard. Can’t you just tell what’s wrong without… this? This is ridiculous. I really need to get back to work. This is wasting my entire day.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It's helpful to pinpoint areas of tenderness. That tenderness can indicate inflammation or irritation. Your vital signs are normal - blood pressure, heart rate, temperature are all within a healthy range. Now, I'm going to give you a collection cup and instructions for collecting the stool samples. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully so we get accurate results. The lab will test for bacteria, parasites, and blood. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. A cup? Really? This is… humiliating. But okay. I’ll do it. Just tell me exactly what I need to do. And try to be discreet, please. Honestly, the indignity of it all… I need a drink after this. A strong drink. Just… hurry up. I have a life, you know. A painting to finish. And a reputation to uphold. This whole visit is just… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, here are the instructions. It explains everything step-by-step. The lab needs a small sample - about the size of a walnut is sufficient. It’s best to collect it first thing in the morning, if possible. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend a bland diet – things like toast, rice, bananas – and plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. And avoid caffeine, alcohol, and dairy for now. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. Bland diet. No caffeine. No alcohol. You're ruining my life. Fine. I’ll try. But don't expect miracles. This whole thing is probably just stress. I've been under a lot of pressure lately. Just… call me with the results. And don’t bother me unless it’s important. I have a painting to finish. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
