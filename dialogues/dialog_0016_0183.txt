DOCTOR: Hi Chirag, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor. My wife, she tell me I need to come. I… feel tired. Always tired. Like, not strong. It been a long time now, maybe… six months? More? I no good at remembering dates, but long time. And the doctor before, he say something about my liver. I forget what he say. Is bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more of feeling tired and weak… that's good information to start with. And you mentioned a previous doctor said something about your liver. Do you remember anything about what he said, even just a word or two?
PATIENT: No, no, I no remember. He talk fast, with big words. I just… feel bad. He give me some pills, I think. Yellow pills. But they no help much. Maybe a little. My wife, she keep the bottles, if that help? She good with remembering things. I just… tired. Is it the liver make me tired? It is a bad thing to have liver trouble?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright that you don't remember the specifics, that happens! And it's great your wife keeps track of things. We can definitely look at the pill bottles. And yes, liver trouble can absolutely cause fatigue, among other things. Whether it is the liver causing your tiredness is what we need to figure out. Let’s start by getting some more information about how you're feeling. Aside from the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind? I… sometimes my stomach feel funny. Not pain, just… heavy. And I no eat much anymore. Food just… no taste good. My wife, she worry about me losing weight. Is that a symptom? Losing weight? I think so. And sometimes… I feel a little sick to my stomach, but I no throw up. Just… feel like I might. Is that all? I no know what other symptoms is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heavy feeling in the stomach, loss of appetite, food not tasting good, weight loss, and feeling nauseous… those are all important things to know. It sounds like you're experiencing quite a few symptoms. Let’s go through some other areas just to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Urine and… stool? You mean… when I go to the bathroom? I… no know. I no look at it. My wife, she clean the bathroom. I just… go. Is that bad? I should look? What I should be looking for? Is it color? Should it be… different? I no know what normal is. Everything feel strange these days.
DOCTOR: It's completely normal not to routinely examine those things! Don't worry, I just ask as part of a general check-up. But you're right, changes in color can be important. Let's not focus on that right now. We'll get a good look at things with some tests. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. My legs feel… thin. My wife say I losing muscle. But no swelling. I wear shoes, always. Maybe if I take shoes off… but I no like walking without shoes. Is that what you mean? Swelling like… big? Like a balloon? No, not like that. I feel weak, mostly. And tired. Very tired. Is this liver trouble getting worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, no swelling, mostly feeling weak and tired. That's helpful. It sounds like you're concerned the liver problem is getting worse, which is understandable. Let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Doctor say I healthy before. Just… old. I get older. My wife, she always take me to the doctor. She say I need check-ups. I no remember what he check for. Just… blood pressure. He poke me with needle. And he say I okay. But that was long time ago. Before I feel so tired. Is this… serious? My wife worry I got something bad. Something I can’t get better from?
DOCTOR: It's good that you were seen regularly before, and that your wife is so proactive about your health. It sounds like you're worried about this being something serious, and it's okay to feel that way. We'll do our best to figure out what's going on. To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me about any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: No. No surgery. No big sickness. I get little colds sometimes. And I break my arm when I was young. Fell from tree. But that was long, long time ago. In Africa. Before I come to this country. No… nothing serious. Just… old. I think. My wife say I need to rest more. But I no sleep good. My mind… always thinking. Is the thinking make me tired?
DOCTOR: Okay, no major illnesses or surgeries, just a broken arm a long time ago. And you're having trouble sleeping, and wonder if that's contributing to the fatigue. That's certainly possible. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Liver problems? I… no know. My family, they all… gone now. In Africa. We no talk about sickness much. We talk about work, about farming. My mother, she get sick when I was young. But I no remember what sickness. She just… weak. And then she gone. My father, he strong man. He work hard. He no get sick. But he gone too. I no know about family sicknesses. Is that bad? I should know about family sicknesses?
DOCTOR: It's alright that you don't have that information. It's not always possible to know. We can still work with what we have. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? No. I no like alcohol. My wife, she no like it either. We drink tea. Sometimes juice. But no alcohol. Is that good? Is alcohol bad for the liver? My wife say everything bad for the liver. Is that true? She worry about everything. I love my wife, but she worry too much. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's good to know - no alcohol. And yes, your wife is right to be cautious; alcohol can be harmful to the liver. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the yellow pills. The ones the doctor before give me. I no remember what they for. They no help much. My wife, she keep them in the kitchen. She give me one every morning. Sometimes two. And I take some… for my knees. They make my knees feel less pain. But they no help much either. I think they make my stomach feel funny. Is that okay? Is too many pills bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, you're taking some yellow pills from a previous doctor that you don't remember the name of, and something for your knees. It sounds like neither are providing much relief, and the knee medication might be upsetting your stomach. I'm going to look up your previous visits to see if I can get more information about those medications. To start, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. Check my heart and lungs. Check my stomach. I no mind. You look at everything. Maybe you find what is wrong. I hope you find what is wrong. My wife, she say I need to know. She say I worry too much. But I just… tired. Is okay to be tired sometimes?
DOCTOR: It is okay to be tired sometimes, Chirag. Everyone gets tired. But six months of persistent fatigue is something we need to investigate. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Hmm, your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a little bit of tenderness in the upper right quadrant. That's where your liver is located. It’s not significant, but it’s something to note. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not alarming. I’m going to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. These tests will check your liver function, kidney function, blood sugar, and overall health. We’ll also check for any signs of infection or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. Blood tests. You check everything. I hope you find what is wrong. My wife, she will be happy. She say I need tests. She say I no look after myself. Is that true? Maybe I no look after myself. I just… tired. So many tests. Is it going to hurt? Is it going to take long? I have appointment with my friend later today. He tell me funny stories. I no want to miss that.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Chirag. The blood tests are very routine and shouldn’t hurt much – just a quick pinch. It will take about 15-20 minutes. We can get you in and out in plenty of time for your appointment with your friend. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function panel. Those will give us a good starting point. The lab technician will take a small sample of blood from your arm. Here is the lab order. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of you. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I no think so. You check everything. You very nice doctor. My wife, she say I need good doctor. I think you good doctor. I just… tired. I go to lab now. Thank you, Doctor Maskal. I hope you find what is wrong. I will see you later.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chirag. I’ll do my best to figure out what’s going on. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
