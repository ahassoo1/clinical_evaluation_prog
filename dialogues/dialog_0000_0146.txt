DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, well, it’s my muscles, mostly. They just feel… weak. Like, not a sudden thing, it's been building for a bit now. It’s hard to explain. I’m Edric, by the way. Just wanted to say that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Edric. I do see your name here. And “weak muscles” isn’t very specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, you’re right. It isn’t. Sorry. It's just… harder to do things. Lifting stuff, even getting up from a chair sometimes. It's not painful, just… takes effort. More effort than it used to, definitely. I work as an insurance appraiser – auto damage – so I'm on my feet a bit, and it's starting to affect things.
DOCTOR: An appraiser, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Mostly looking at cars that have been in accidents. Figuring out how much they’re worth, what needs fixing… you know. It’s not exactly heavy lifting, but there's a lot of bending, crouching, getting into awkward spots. It’s… becoming a problem, to be honest. I just want to figure out what’s going on so I can get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this has been a gradual onset. No specific injury?
PATIENT: Nope. No injury, not that I can remember. It just… slowly got worse over the last few months, maybe six months? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, honestly. I didn't really pay attention at first. Just figured I was getting old, I guess. I'm 38, which I don't feel is old, but… maybe it is.
DOCTOR: “Figured you were getting old”?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. I mean, things just start to ache, right? It felt like that. Just… normal wear and tear. But it’s getting to the point where it’s interfering with work. And, honestly, it’s a bit worrying. I don’t want it to get any worse. I didn’t think much of it until recently, when even simple things started feeling difficult.
DOCTOR: “Aching” and “difficulty” are rather vague terms, Mr. McKinnon. Tell me, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. Not really any pain, just… fatigue, maybe? I get tired quicker than I used to. And… sometimes my hands feel a bit shaky, especially when I’m trying to write something. That's new, I think. I haven’t noticed anything else, not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Shakiness. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Actually… yeah, I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not intentionally, just… not much of an appetite lately. Maybe five or ten pounds? It’s hard to say exactly. I haven't weighed myself in a while, to be honest. I’m usually around 170, but I’d guess I'm closer to 160 now. And, uh… no, I don’t have insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: "No insurance" is… relevant, Mr. McKinnon. Now, let's get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any problems with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Uh… wow, okay. That’s a… direct question. No, not really. Everything seems… normal there. Look, I appreciate you trying to figure things out, but are you sure you need all this detail? It’s a bit… personal, isn’t it? I just want to know why my muscles are weak.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, weakness can stem from a multitude of issues, and a thorough assessment is crucial. These questions are not asked for mere curiosity. Now, have you noticed any increased thirst or urination?
PATIENT: No, not really. I drink the usual amount of water, I guess. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. I haven’t been as thirsty lately. And no changes in… well, you know. Look, is there something seriously wrong? You’re asking a lot of… specific questions. Are we looking at something bad? I just want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, I assure you, I'm attempting to gather pertinent information. Now, regarding your family history, are there any instances of neurological disorders, muscle weakness, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… let me think. My mom had some… arthritis, I think? Bad knees, mostly. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, I think. But nothing like… muscle weakness or anything. No diabetes that I know of. We didn’t really talk about health stuff much. To be honest, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We weren’t really a close family. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Slightly. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched any of that stuff. I drink coffee, sometimes. A couple of cups a day, maybe. Is this… is this going to cost a lot of money? I really don't have a lot to spend right now.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, I require a complete medical history to provide a proper assessment. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. Just… coffee. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills. Look, I know you need all this information, but… can we just get to the point? Is there something seriously wrong? And what’s this going to cost me? I'm getting worried. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. It will allow me to better assess your condition. Please stand up and let’s begin. I’ll need you to follow my instructions carefully. First, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. What exactly are you going to do? I don't like surprises. I just want to know what's going on with my muscles. And how much this is going to cost. Seriously.
DOCTOR: I will be using a reflex hammer to test your reflexes in your arms and legs. It’s a standard procedure. Now, please extend your arm, palm up.
PATIENT: Ow! That stung a little. What was that for? It didn’t feel right. I mean, what does that even mean? It just feels… weird now. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It assesses your neurological function. The response appears diminished. Now, let’s check the other side. Again, diminished. Now, please sit on the examination table. We’ll assess your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It doesn’t feel very strong. I used to be able to squeeze much harder. This is making me nervous. What are you finding?
DOCTOR: Weakness noted in both hands. Now, please push against my palm with your feet. Push as hard as you can. I need to see your strength.
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. My legs feel tired already. Is something seriously wrong? What's happening? It feels like I have no strength. I really don’t like this.
DOCTOR: Weakness noted in both legs as well. Now, let’s check your gait. Please stand up and walk a few steps.
PATIENT: Okay… but be careful. I feel… wobbly. Woah! See? I’m not very stable. This isn't good. What's wrong with me? I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: As I suspected. Your gait is noticeably impaired. Now, please remain seated. I need to ask a few more questions. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little… coldness sometimes, but that's it. I work with cars all day, so my hands are cold a lot. This is really scaring me. What's going on? You haven't told me anything yet. Is it something serious? Can you just tell me what you think?
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, based on my assessment, your symptoms—the progressive weakness, diminished reflexes, impaired gait, and lack of sensation—suggest a possible neurological issue. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation. We need to rule out several possibilities, including, but not limited to, motor neuron disease, peripheral neuropathy, or a vitamin deficiency. I will order a comprehensive blood panel, including a vitamin B12 level, as well as an electromyography—an EMG—to assess the electrical activity of your muscles. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. Given your lack of insurance, this may be… difficult.
PATIENT: …Neurologist? EMG? Vitamin deficiency? …I… I don’t understand. Motor neuron… that sounds… bad. And you said… difficult because I don't have insurance? How much is all this going to cost? I… I can’t afford a lot. What are my options? I just wanted to know why my muscles were weak, not… this. I think I need to sit here for a minute. This is too much.
DOCTOR: I will provide you with the lab requisition and referral information. As for cost, I cannot offer an estimate, as pricing varies considerably. You may need to contact the lab and neurologist directly to inquire about potential payment plans or financial assistance programs. Now, if you have no further questions, I suggest you schedule these appointments as soon as possible. The sooner we have a diagnosis, the sooner we can formulate a treatment plan.
