DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My foot… it’s been hurting. A long time now. It’s got a sore, a bad one, and it won’t get better. It’s on my foot, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for a while. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it started small, like a little cut. But it just… stayed. And got deeper. Now it’s… painful to walk. I try to wear slippers all the time, but even that hurts sometimes. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes, I think. It’s hard for me to see.
DOCTOR: I see. So it started as a small cut and hasn’t healed, and now it's causing you pain when you walk, even with slippers. That sounds uncomfortable. To get a better understanding, can you describe the sore itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… what do you mean, describe? It’s… red. And it’s got… stuff in it. Not good stuff. It sometimes gets a little wet. And it smells… not very nice. I try to keep it clean, I really do, with soap and water, but… it doesn’t help much. It's not a big sore, but it's deep, I think. Deeper than it looks.
DOCTOR: Okay, red, with some discharge, and has an odor. You've been keeping it clean with soap and water, which is good. It sounds like it could be infected. To help me figure out what's going on, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Well, my leg, the one with the bad foot, it gets a little swollen sometimes. Not big, but I can tell. And… I get tired easier now. More tired than usual. I used to walk to the store, but… not anymore. Too much pain. And… oh! My vision isn't so good anymore. But I’m old, maybe that’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the leg, increased fatigue, and you've noticed some changes in your vision. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Those are all important things to know. Now, do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor told me… a long time ago… I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that’s what they call it. I try to eat right, but… it’s hard. And… sometimes my feet feel cold, even when it's warm. They say that’s the circulation. Not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have diabetes and some circulation issues. That’s very helpful information. Diabetes can sometimes cause foot problems and slow down healing, and poor circulation can make things even more difficult. Are you currently taking any medications for your diabetes or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take pills. Little white pills. Two of them every morning. For the sugar sickness. And… sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, when it gets too high. But not every day. Just when the doctor tells me to. I can't remember what they're called…
DOCTOR: Okay, two pills every morning for diabetes and something for your blood pressure as needed. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat lots of fish, lots of fruit… haven’t had any trouble. My wife… she always asked me if I was allergic to anything before she passed, but I never was.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, it sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Please, have a look. It really hurts, though. Be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay. I see the sore here, on the bottom of your foot near your toes. It’s red, and there’s some drainage. It is tender to the touch, and it feels a little warm. Your pulses feel weak, which is consistent with your circulation issues. There's some surrounding redness as well, which suggests there may be some infection present. I’m going to document these findings. “August 2, 2025: Patient presents with a chronic sore on the bottom of the foot, near the toes. Sore is red, draining, tender to palpation, and warm. Surrounding erythema present. Weak dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.” Now, do you have any recent blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Hmm… not recently. The doctor… it was a long time ago, maybe a year or so. He checked my sugar, I think. And something else… I don’t remember. He said my sugar was a little high, but… he gave me pills, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's been about a year since your last blood work. Given your history of diabetes, the sore on your foot, and the weak pulses, I think it would be a good idea to get some blood tests done to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and to look for any signs of infection. I'm also concerned about the possibility of a deeper infection in your foot, so I'd like to order an X-ray to rule out any bone involvement. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray…? That sounds… serious. Is it bad? I just want this sore to go away. It hurts so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. An X-ray will help us get a better look at the bone beneath the sore and rule out any deeper issues. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's important to be thorough, especially with diabetes and a wound that isn’t healing. We’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll start with the blood work and the X-ray, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan to get this sore healed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Will it cost a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you see. My Medicare… will it cover it? I don’t want to get a big bill.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. Let me reassure you, Medicare should cover both the blood work and the X-ray, especially given your diabetes diagnosis. There may be a small co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan, but our billing department is very good at working with Medicare and will help you understand any potential costs upfront. I can also write a referral for you to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – who can help manage the wound care. They will also be able to file the claims with Medicare. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A podiatrist sounds good. Someone who knows about feet. And if they can help with the Medicare… that would be wonderful. I just want this pain to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll write a referral for you to Dr. Lei – she’s a very good podiatrist here in town, and her office is familiar with Medicare. I’ll also have my nurse, Maria, print out the lab order for the blood work and a slip for the X-ray. “Referral to Dr. Evelyn Lei, Podiatry. Patient presents with chronic, non-healing wound on the bottom of the foot, complicated by diabetes and poor circulation. Further evaluation and wound care recommended.” Maria will also give you instructions on where to go for the blood work and X-ray. In the meantime, please try to keep the area clean and dry, and avoid putting any pressure on your foot as much as possible. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you very much. You’ve been very kind. And thank you for helping me with the Medicare. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns after you see Dr. Lei. Maria will be in shortly to give you the paperwork and schedule your follow-up. Get some rest and try not to worry too much. We’ll get this sorted out. Have a good day, Mr. Stoegbauer.
