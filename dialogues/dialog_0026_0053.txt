DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's... it's my waterworks, really. I'm having a bit of trouble going to the bathroom. It's not easy, you see? It takes me a while, and sometimes it just…doesn’t happen right away.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with urination. That can be a number of things, so let's try to get a clearer picture. When did you first start noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s been getting worse slowly, I suppose. But I'd say… maybe three months ago? It started just being a little slow, but now it’s… more noticeable, if that makes sense. Like I have to really push sometimes. And I feel like I don't empty everything, even after I go.
DOCTOR: Okay, about three months, gradually worsening. And you feel like you have to strain to go, and don't fully empty your bladder. Do you find yourself going more often than usual, or waking up at night to urinate?
PATIENT: No, not really going more often, no. And thankfully, I still sleep through the night. I haven’t had to get up, which is good. It’s just… the effort, you know? It feels like I'm working too hard to do something that should be easy. And like a little bit always stays in there, even when I think I'm finished.
DOCTOR: Alright, so not increased frequency, and you're still sleeping through the night, which is good. And the main issue is the effort and the feeling of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, thankfully. Not burning either. It doesn’t hurt. It’s just… frustrating. And a little worrying, to be honest. I’m a fairly healthy woman, all things considered. I eat good food, I walk every day... I don't want something serious to be going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kandy, and it's good you're proactive about getting it checked out. No pain or burning is a good sign. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think. Well, my mother had high blood pressure, but I don’t. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. And… oh! I had a gallbladder removed years ago, maybe twenty years now. But other than that… no, nothing major. I’ve been very lucky, really. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low last year. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, no high blood pressure, some arthritis, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and a vitamin D supplement. The supplement is good to know, thank you. Now, can you tell me about any medications you take regularly, besides the vitamin D?
PATIENT: Just the vitamin D, really. I take one thousand IU every day, with my breakfast. No other pills, no creams, nothing. I try to avoid taking too much medication if I can. I believe in letting my body do what it needs to do, if possible. I did take something for the arthritis a few years back, but it didn’t agree with me, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the vitamin D. That’s helpful. And no allergies to any medications that you know of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, I don't really restrict my diet much. I like my pickles! And my little bit of chocolate, now and then. No, I haven't ever had an allergic reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Okay, Kandy, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, like I said, my mother had high blood pressure. My father, he was a strong man, lived to be eighty-five. He didn’t have any major health problems, as far as I know. My sister, she's still alive, she’s eighty. She has a bit of trouble with her memory, but otherwise she’s doing alright. No one else in the family had any issues with… well, with their waterworks, if you know what I mean. No one ever talked about it much. It wasn’t something we really discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with high blood pressure, father healthy, sister with some memory issues, and no family history of urinary problems that you're aware of. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, I try to stay active. I walk for about thirty minutes every day, usually in the park. I live alone, but I have friends I see regularly. I enjoy reading, and I do a bit of gardening in the summer. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing too wild! I eat a fairly healthy diet, lots of vegetables and fish. And I try to get enough sleep, though sometimes it's hard when I'm worried about things.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy lifestyle, Kandy. It’s good to hear. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing. And then I’ll need to do a gentle pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. A bit embarrassing, perhaps, but I understand. You have to do what you have to do. Just… be gentle, please? And tell me what you're doing as you go, if you don't mind. I like to know what’s happening. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kandy. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and sensation. Everything seems normal there as well. Finally, I'm going to perform a gentle pelvic exam. I’ll need you to lie on your back with your feet in stirrups. I'll be using a light and a speculum. This might feel a bit cold, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go… A little cold, like you said. Is there anything you're looking for specifically? I always like to know what you're trying to find. It helps me relax a little. And please, tell me if it's uncomfortable. Don't be shy. It’s a bit… personal, but I understand you have to do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: I’m looking at the bladder neck and urethra for any signs of inflammation or blockage. I’m also checking the vaginal walls and cervix. I’m not seeing any obvious signs of infection or blockage. There is some mild laxity, which is common with age and childbirth, but nothing concerning. The cervix looks normal. Now, I'm going to do a quick bimanual exam, feeling your uterus and ovaries to make sure everything feels normal. Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries feel normal as well. No tenderness or masses. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Now I just want to check your post-void residual. I am going to have you urinate into a container, and then I will use a small ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. That makes sense. It’s good you checked everything. I was a bit worried it might be something serious. So, the ultrasound… will it hurt? I always worry about these things. And is leaving a little urine in your bladder normal? I feel like I should be able to empty it completely.
DOCTOR: No, the ultrasound won't hurt at all. It's completely non-invasive. It uses sound waves to create an image of your bladder. It's similar to how they check a baby during pregnancy. And leaving a small amount of urine in your bladder is fairly common, especially as we get older. It’s called post-void residual, and a small amount – usually less than 50 milliliters – is considered normal. However, a larger amount can sometimes indicate a problem. Let’s see what the measurement is before we jump to any conclusions. Okay, the measurement is 80 milliliters. That’s a little elevated, but not dramatically so. It could be contributing to your symptoms, but it's not a definitive diagnosis.
PATIENT: Eighty milliliters… a little elevated, you say? What does that mean, exactly? Is that something I should be worried about? And what happens now? Do I need more tests? I don’t like the idea of more tests, if I’m honest. I’ve never been good with hospitals and doctors and things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy, let's talk about that 80 milliliters. It means there's a little bit of urine remaining in your bladder after you empty it. Ideally, we'd like to see less than 50 milliliters. Eighty isn't alarmingly high, but it could explain some of the feeling of incomplete emptying and the effort you're experiencing. It doesn't automatically mean something serious is wrong, but it does warrant a little further investigation. Now, about more tests, I understand your reluctance. We don't have to do a lot, but I’d like to order a simple urine analysis, just to rule out any infection. And I'd also like to do a basic urodynamic study. It's a non-invasive test that measures the pressure and flow of urine as you urinate. It will give us a better understanding of how your bladder is functioning. It doesn't involve any needles or incisions. We can discuss the specifics, and if you're really uncomfortable with it, we can explore other options, but these tests will help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urine analysis, that doesn't sound too bad. And the urodynamic study… no needles, you say? What exactly does it involve? Will it be uncomfortable? I really don't like the idea of anything painful. I’m already worried enough as it is. And how long will it take? I have a book club meeting on Thursday, and I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's talk about the urodynamic study. It doesn't involve any needles. You'll lie on a comfortable table, and we'll insert a small catheter into your bladder – just like when you urinate, but we leave it in for a little longer. It doesn't go in very far, and you shouldn't feel any pain, though you might feel a slight pressure. Then, we'll ask you to urinate while we measure the pressure in your bladder and the flow of urine. The whole process takes about 30-45 minutes. We’ll monitor your vital signs throughout the procedure, and if you experience any discomfort, we'll stop immediately. The results will help us determine if you have any bladder weakness or issues with your pelvic floor muscles. If the results are normal, we might recommend some simple pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels, to strengthen your muscles. If the results show something else, we can discuss other options, like medication or referral to a specialist. We can schedule the test for next week, and it shouldn't interfere with your book club meeting. Does that sound more comfortable?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises… I've heard of those. My friend mentioned them once. And next week sounds alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. And you promise it won't be painful? I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, you see. I don't handle medical things very well. And will I be able to drive myself home afterwards? I don't have anyone to take me, and the bus schedule is terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy, I promise we'll take it slow and make sure you're comfortable every step of the way. Pelvic floor exercises are very simple, and we can show you how to do them properly. And yes, you will absolutely be able to drive yourself home afterwards. The procedure is non-invasive and doesn't require any recovery time. You might feel a little bit of urge afterwards, but that should subside quickly. We'll schedule the test for next Tuesday at 10 am, giving you plenty of time to get home and rest. We'll also give you some information about pelvic floor exercises to take with you, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, next Tuesday at ten sounds good. And the information about the exercises is helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I really appreciate it. I was so worried, but you’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel a little bit better now. Do I need to do anything to prepare for the test? Should I drink anything before, or avoid drinking anything? I always worry about getting everything wrong.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. And you're not getting anything wrong! For the urodynamic study, you don't need to do anything special to prepare. You can eat and drink normally before the test. In fact, it's helpful to drink about 32 ounces of fluids in the two hours before the test to ensure your bladder is full. Just avoid caffeinated beverages, as they can irritate your bladder. I'm writing this down for you, along with the information about the pelvic floor exercises. Here. We’ll see you next Tuesday at ten. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, we’ll take things slow and make sure you’re comfortable every step of the way. Have a good day, Kandy.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Finco. You've been wonderful. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I think I’ll be alright. I’ll try to drink plenty of water and not worry too much. Have a good day too.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, we’re here to help. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day, and I'll see you next Tuesday.
