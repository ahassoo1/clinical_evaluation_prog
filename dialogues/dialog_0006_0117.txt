DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Doc, I... I been coughin’. Not just any cough, though. There's… stuff in it. Red stuff. Been happenin' a little while now. I smoke, you know. Always have. I just… want it checked. Don't remember exactly when it started, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with… red stuff. Right. And you said you smoke?
PATIENT: Yeah, I smoke. Been smokin' since I was... well, a long time ago. Packs a day, mostly. Used to be more. Not tryin' to make excuses, just tellin' you what it is. Is the red stuff… bad? I don't really know what it means. Medicare cover this, right? I got that.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll figure it out. Medicare should cover this, yes. We'll get everything sorted. Let's try to get a little more detail about the cough itself. Besides the red stuff, is it a dry cough, or do you bring up a lot of mucus?
PATIENT: Uh… mucus, yeah. Some. Not… gallons, but it ain't dry. More when I first wake up. And… sometimes when I really get to hackin’. Sorry. It’s… a deep cough. Feels like it's comin' from way down. Does that make sense? I ain't good at explainin' things.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep cough, more mucus in the mornings and with… forceful coughing. Right. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other stuff? Hmmm… I get kinda tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And… sometimes my chest feels tight. Not always, but… yeah. Hard to breathe sometimes. Is that the smokin’? I just figured… I don't know anymore. Everything feels kinda… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and chest tightness along with the cough. And you're wondering if it's the smoking. It very well could be, but we need to rule other things out. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… Not that I noticed. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I just figured that was the heat. New Mexico's been hot. Chills… no. And night sweats… uh… I sleep pretty heavy. Don’t usually wake up sweaty. Sorry, I don't remember much. I just want to know what’s wrong. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills, or night sweats. We’re going to do a quick exam, listen to your lungs, check your oxygen levels, and get a better idea of what's going on. Just need to listen to your breathing, okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need. Just… quick, if you could? I got some things I gotta get done today. I appreciate you seein' me. It’s just… time is short.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out. Okay. I hear some wheezing, and some crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Let’s also check your heart rate and blood pressure. Pulse is a bit elevated at 88, and blood pressure is 140/90. I'm going to ask you to rate your shortness of breath on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst.
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… It ain’t terrible all the time. When I walk uphill, or… tryin’ to carry somethin’ heavy, it gets worse. Maybe… a 6? On a good day, maybe a 4. Is that bad? A 6? I don’t even know what a normal number is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6. That indicates some level of difficulty. Given your history of smoking, the cough with red mucus, the wheezing and crackles I heard, and your oxygen levels, I’m concerned about a possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, or possibly pneumonia. To be sure, we need a chest X-ray. We also need to do a sputum sample to look for infection. And I'm going to order a blood test to check for inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… sputum… blood test… Sounds… complicated. And expensive. Will Medicare cover all this? I ain't got a lot of extra money. And… what does it mean? COPD… what is that? Is that… serious? Just tell me straight, Doc. What are we lookin’ at here?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno, let’s take it one step at a time. Medicare should cover these tests, yes. We’ll make sure everything is pre-authorized. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a lung condition that makes it hard to breathe. It's often caused by smoking, and it gets worse over time. The tests will help us figure out what's going on and how severe it is. The sputum sample will look for any infection in your lungs, and the blood test will check for inflammation. Right now, I can't give you a definitive diagnosis, but we need to rule out pneumonia and assess the damage to your lungs. We'll get those tests done today, and I'll explain the results to you as soon as I have them. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… tests. COPD. Pneumonia. Inflammation. So… you think it's bad? You think I’m… really sick? I just want to breathe normal again. Is there anything… anything I can do right now to help? Before the tests?
