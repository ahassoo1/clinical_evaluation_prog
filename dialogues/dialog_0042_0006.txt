DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um, well, I have been… coughing up some blood. It scared me very much, so I thought I should come see a doctor right away. It’s not a lot of blood, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers, I understand. Coughing up blood – even a small amount – is definitely something we should investigate. It's good you came in right away. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe three days ago? At first, I just thought it was a really bad cough, you know? Like a cold. But then I noticed… little streaks of red in the… the stuff I coughed up. It happens mostly in the morning, I think. Not every morning, but… a few times. It doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… surprising. And a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days ago, mostly in the morning… and you said it's not painful, just surprising and frightening. That's helpful to know. Has anything else been going on at the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little… tired, maybe? But I work very hard, so I am often tired. And I’ve had a little bit of a… a stuffy nose, I suppose. Nothing major. Oh! And… my appetite has been a little low. I haven’t been eating as much as usual, but I thought that was just because I was worried. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, those details are important, Ms. Weichers. The fatigue, stuffy nose, and decreased appetite… all potentially relevant. When you cough, do you feel any chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. The cough itself doesn't hurt, and I can breathe normally. It doesn't make it hard to catch my breath at all. It just… feels like a normal cough, only with the… the blood. I'm sorry, it is difficult to explain. I am just… anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Ms. Weichers. There’s nothing to be sorry about at all; you’re explaining everything perfectly. Since you're having a cough with blood, and no chest pain or shortness of breath, that's good. Now, let’s go over some other things. Have you had a fever at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t felt warm or anything like that. I checked my temperature yesterday, just to be sure, and it was normal. I don’t feel sick, besides being worried, of course. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Weichers. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you had any recent illnesses like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. About two weeks ago, I had a… a bad cold. It wasn’t the flu, I don’t think. No fever, but I was very stuffy and had a terrible cough for almost a week. It felt like it was getting better, and then… the blood started. Could it be from that?
DOCTOR: That’s certainly a possibility, Ms. Weichers. Sometimes a cough can linger after a cold and cause some irritation. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any underlying health conditions – like asthma, bronchitis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have been… mostly healthy, I think. I have high blood pressure, but my doctor has medicine for it, and it’s controlled. And… um… my husband passed away two years ago. He had… heart problems. But I don’t have any… any ongoing health issues, other than the blood pressure. I am sorry to bring that up. It feels… strange to talk about.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Weichers. It's never easy to talk about loss, and knowing your history is important. And thank you for letting me know about the controlled high blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven't had many problems with medicine before. I can take most things without any trouble. Is that helpful? I am just trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Weichers. And you're doing a wonderful job remembering everything. Just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband smoked, a long time ago, but I never did. I always told him it was bad for his health, and… well. I don’t smoke, and I don't drink alcohol very much. Maybe a small glass of wine sometimes, with dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I want to find out what is going on, so please, do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Please take deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Okay, your lung sounds are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Now, I’ll check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your heart rate is 78 and your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Finally, let’s take a look at your throat. Please open your mouth wide and say "Ah." Your throat looks a little red, but nothing major. No visible signs of infection. Everything seems okay so far. Given your history and the exam findings, the blood you're coughing up could be due to irritation from the recent cold, potentially causing some small blood vessel rupture. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample analysis. The X-ray will help rule out any underlying lung conditions, and the sputum analysis will check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. An X-ray and a test of the… the stuff I cough up. Whatever you think is best, I trust your judgement. It’s good to know it could be from the cold, but I am glad you want to check properly. How do we do those tests? And… will they hurt? I am always a little nervous about tests.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Weichers. I want to assure you neither test will be painful. For the chest X-ray, you'll simply stand in front of a machine, and it will take a picture of your lungs. It's a very quick and painless procedure. As for the sputum sample, you'll be asked to cough deeply into a sterile container. We'll give you instructions on how to do that properly to get a good sample. The radiology department is just down the hall, and the nurse will assist you with the X-ray. After that, we’ll collect the sputum sample here in the office. I’ll write the orders now, and the nurse will get things started. While we wait for the results – which usually take 24 to 48 hours – I’ll also prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate some of your discomfort. If the bleeding worsens or you develop a fever, please contact us immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds like a very good plan. X-ray and a cough medicine. And I will contact you if things get worse. That makes me feel much better. Thank you very much for explaining everything so clearly. You have put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I should be doing while we wait for the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. While we wait for the results, it’s best to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Avoid strenuous activity and try to stay away from irritants like smoke or dust. If you feel any chest pain, shortness of breath, or have a fever, please don’t hesitate to call. Also, please avoid any over-the-counter medications containing decongestants, as they can sometimes dry out the airways and worsen your cough. We want to avoid anything that might interfere with getting an accurate sputum sample. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the X-ray instructions and collect a sample for basic bloodwork. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you have explained everything very thoroughly. I don't have any more questions at the moment. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I feel much better knowing what to expect. I appreciate your help very much.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I am glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have any concerns at all. I will review the results as soon as they come in and contact you with the findings. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
