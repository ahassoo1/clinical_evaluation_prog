DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, really. I've had the hiccups for… oh, let me think… more than two days now. It's just not stopping.
DOCTOR: Two days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Started sometime on Saturday, I think. And they just… keep coming. It's exhausting, honestly. I run a little events company, you see, and trying to talk to clients while hiccuping isn’t the most professional look.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds frustrating, especially with your line of work. Hmm… okay. And can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they're… regular hiccups, I guess? Not a huge, booming kind, more little ones. They come every few minutes, maybe a little more often when I try to drink something. I've tried holding my breath, like everyone says, and drinking water upside down… nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed anything before the hiccups started?
PATIENT: That's a good question… let me think. No, not really. Saturday was pretty normal. I was setting up for a small birthday party… lots of running around, a bit stressed, maybe? But nothing unusual for me. I did have a spicy tagine for dinner Friday night, though. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: It could be. Sometimes spicy foods can trigger things. Alright, let's just run through a few things to get a better picture. Have you had any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. No fever, no stomach pain… just the hiccups. I’m eating normally, sleeping normally… everything else is completely fine. It’s just… this persistent hiccuping. It's incredibly annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ivette?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I try to eat well and get enough rest, as much as running an events company allows, anyway. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I’ve never had any reactions to anything. Food, medicine, animals… nothing. I'm quite lucky that way, I think. It's just this hiccuping that's bothering me!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything else is okay. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I appreciate you checking everything. It’s just… I’d like to get rid of these hiccups as soon as possible. They’re really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally through your mouth. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Okay, and your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Everything seems… perfectly normal, physically. That's good. Now, sometimes persistent hiccups can be related to… well, a variety of things. It could be a minor irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. It could also be related to stress, as you mentioned. We could try a few things… have you tried holding your breath and bearing down, like trying to have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I did try holding my breath, but I haven't tried bearing down. I just tried the normal holding-my-breath technique. I’ll try that next, I suppose. Is there anything else? It feels a bit silly talking about hiccups for so long, honestly. They just won’t go away!
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ivette. Two days of persistent hiccups is definitely worth investigating. If bearing down doesn’t work, we could consider a medication to calm the diaphragm. It's not something I'd prescribe immediately, though. Sometimes, they just resolve on their own. Let's try the bearing down technique a few times, and if they still persist tomorrow, come back and we'll explore other options. I can give you a prescription for Baclofen just in case, and you can fill it if needed. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you not immediately jumping to medication. I'll definitely try the bearing down thing. And yes, a prescription for Baclofen would be good, just in case. Thank you for your time and help. I really hope they go away overnight! I have a wedding to plan on Friday and I need to be able to speak clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s a prescription for Baclofen. Take it only if they don’t improve, and follow the instructions carefully. And don't hesitate to come back if they get worse or if you develop any other symptoms. I'm hopeful they'll resolve on their own. Stress can certainly contribute, so try to relax as much as possible. And best of luck with the wedding planning! Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your help and patience. It really puts my mind at ease knowing I have something to fall back on if they don't stop. I’ll try the bearing down and hope for the best. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day too, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I'm optimistic that you'll be hiccup-free soon.
