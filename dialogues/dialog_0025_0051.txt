DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini, good morning. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... what did bring me in? Let me think a moment. It's... about my blood, I believe. My daughter, she said it was important to know... what do you call it... the type? Yes, that’s it. She wants me to know my blood type. I can’t quite recall why, but she was very insistent. It’s a bit silly of me, I suppose, getting this old and forgetting things.
DOCTOR: Your blood type, alright. Well, it’s certainly not silly to want to know your blood type, Ms. Nini, though it's a bit unusual to come in solely for that information at your age. Still, we can certainly do that. It's good to be informed. Do you have any idea why your daughter is so concerned?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. She just said something about... emergencies? And paperwork, maybe? She handles all the important things these days. My head isn’t what it used to be, you see. I used to be quite good with ropes and heights, working as a rigger, but all that feels very far away now. She’s a sensible girl, my daughter. If she says it’s important, it probably is. I just wish I knew what exactly she's worried about.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, knowing your blood type is useful in emergency situations, and it is good to have it on file. It helps with transfusions, should you ever need one. Paperwork…likely advance directives, perhaps?
PATIENT: Transfusions… yes, that sounds right. Something about needing blood, if… if something happens. Oh dear, she’s probably imagining the worst! I don’t recall ever needing a transfusion before. Advance... what did you call it? It sounds very official. Is that something I need to worry about now? I just want to know what group I am, A, B, or… something else. Is that difficult to find out?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, it’s a relatively simple blood test. We’ll draw a small sample and send it to the lab. It's not a difficult process at all. And yes, an advance directive is something to consider, but we can address that after we get your blood type. Let’s focus on that first, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a simple test? Good. That’s all I wanted. A simple test. I don't like needles much, but... well, if it's quick, I suppose I can manage. Is the lab nearby? Will I have to wait a long time for the results? I have a bit of a… a fondness for my afternoon tea, and I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: The lab is right here in the clinic, Ms. Nini. It shouldn’t take long at all – maybe fifteen minutes for the draw and then a couple of hours for the results. We can have a nurse come in and draw the sample right away. You can relax in the waiting room, and we’ll let you know as soon as we have the results. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A couple of hours is no trouble at all. And right here in the clinic? That's convenient. Yes, please, go ahead and send a nurse when you’re ready. I suppose I’ll just sit and… people-watch, then. Thank you for being so patient with my forgetfulness. It really is a bother, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. It's no problem at all. Just try to relax. We'll get this sorted out for you.
