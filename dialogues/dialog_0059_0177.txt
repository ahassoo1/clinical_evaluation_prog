DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Romario, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… it’s a problem. A problem with… down there. It’s…leaking. Yes, leaking. Not good. I don’t know why it’s leaking, but it is. It’s been happening for… a little while now, I guess. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. Is that… okay? I don’t really understand what you want to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Jimmi, that’s perfectly okay. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I appreciate you being open with me. “Leaking,” as you describe it, can have several causes, and we’ll certainly get to the bottom of it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice? That's… hard to say. Old age, I suppose! Everything gets blurry. Maybe… a few weeks ago? Or maybe longer. I don’t keep track of these things. I just noticed my clothes weren’t… clean. And it smelled funny. It's not like I'm going out dancing every night, so it took me a while to notice. Honestly, I thought it was just me being messy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jimmi, it’s common to not keep precise track. A few weeks, then. And you noticed it with a change in your clothing and a different smell. Is the leakage constant, or does it happen at certain times?
PATIENT: Certain times? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. It just… happens. Like a leaky faucet, I guess. Drip, drip, drip. Sometimes more than others, maybe. When I get… warm? Or when I’m… sitting? I don't know! I really don't pay attention to it until I smell it, and then I have to change. It's embarrassing, you know? A woman my age shouldn't have to worry about things like this.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jimmi. It's perfectly normal to feel embarrassed, and you shouldn't have to worry about this alone. It sounds like it might be happening more when you're warmer or sitting, but it's okay that you're not sure. To help me narrow things down, have you noticed any other changes along with this leakage?
PATIENT: Other changes? Like… what kind of changes? My eyesight is getting worse, if that counts. And my knees ache. But that's just getting old. Oh! And I get tired easily. Very easily. I used to be able to garden all day, but now… just a little bit makes me need a nap. Is that what you mean? Anything… down there… besides the leaking? No, I don’t think so. It doesn't hurt, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jimmi. That’s helpful. So, worsening eyesight, aching knees, and increased fatigue. No pain with the leakage itself. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me think. Dr. Silva, he passed away years ago, he told me my sugar was a little high once. Said I needed to watch what I ate. But I like my sweets! And I think… maybe high blood pressure? He gave me a little pill for it, but it made me dizzy, so I stopped taking it. I don't really go to the doctor much. Too expensive, and they always poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jimmi. So, a history of borderline high blood sugar and high blood pressure, but you discontinued the medication for the blood pressure due to dizziness. That’s important information. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Oh! Yes. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. And… and when I broke my wrist falling out of a mango tree. That was a long time ago. And… I think I had a cyst removed from my arm once. Small thing. That's all I can remember. Nothing… down there. Never anything down there.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy, a wrist fracture repair, and a cyst removal. And no prior surgeries in the pelvic region. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a hard one. My mother… she died young, of a fever. They didn’t have good doctors back then. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. Always complaining about his chest. And my brother… he got sick, a long time ago. Some kind of wasting disease. They said it was the lungs. But nobody really talked about these things. We just… dealt with it. It wasn't like today, with all the fancy testing and everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jimmi. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete, especially with older generations. So, a history of fever leading to your mother’s death, heart problems in your father, and a lung illness in your brother. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were bad for you, and she was right about most things. My husband, he used to smoke a little, after dinner. But I always made him go outside. Didn't want the smell in the house. Bad for the curtains, you know. And bad for your health, of course.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Jimmi. And it sounds like you were quite firm about keeping the smoke out of the house! Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little wine now and then. Just a small glass with dinner. Chamorro wine, you know. It’s made with mangoes. Very good. Not much else, though. Never liked beer, too bitter. And hard liquor… makes me dizzy. I don’t need any help with that, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Jimmi. A small glass of Chamorro wine with dinner. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Mangoes, fish, chicken, rice… I'm not a picky eater. I did have a rash once, when I was a little girl, after I touched some poison ivy. But that was a long time ago. And I haven’t seen any poison ivy since. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Unless… maybe dust? Sometimes I sneeze when I clean. But that’s just dust!
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a pelvic exam to better understand the source of the leakage. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A pelvic exam? You mean… down there? Oh dear. Well… I suppose if you have to. It’s just… embarrassing. And I haven't had one of those in… a long time. A very long time. But if it will help… alright. Just be gentle, please. And don’t be surprised if things are… a little rusty.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. I will be as gentle as possible, and I understand it’s been a long time. We’ll take things at your pace, and you can tell me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your abdomen. After that, we’ll proceed with the pelvic exam. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Now, if you’re ready, we can proceed with the pelvic exam. I’ll explain each step as I go.
PATIENT: Alright… I’m ready, I think. Just… hurry, please. And tell me what you’re doing. I don’t like surprises. Everything feels… a little loose, you know? Old age, I suppose. It’s not like it used to be. Oh dear… just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. I will explain everything as I go, and we will take our time. I’m just going to gently insert a speculum to visualize the vaginal area and cervix. This may cause some mild pressure. I’m visualizing the vaginal walls now. There is some thinning of the vaginal tissues, which is common with aging. The cervix appears healthy, and I don’t see any obvious signs of infection or inflammation. However, I do note some mild prolapse of the bladder into the vaginal wall—a cystocele. This means the bladder is descending slightly into the vagina. This could contribute to the leakage you're experiencing. Now, I’ll perform a brief rectal exam to assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles. Your rectal exam is normal. Your pelvic floor muscles have some weakness, which is also common with age and can contribute to the leakage. Alright, Jimmi, the exam is complete. I’ve documented my findings.
PATIENT: Oh… a cysto-what-you-call-it? And weak muscles? That sounds… terrible. Is it serious? Will I need… surgery? I don't want surgery. I'm too old for surgery. And what about the leakage? Can you fix it? Please tell me you can fix it. I just want it to stop. It's embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Jimmi. Let's go through this step by step. The cystocele, or bladder prolapse, is common as we age, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious. It happens when the muscles supporting the bladder weaken, causing it to descend slightly into the vagina. The weakness in your pelvic floor muscles contributes to this. Regarding the leakage, it's likely caused by a combination of the cystocele and the weakened pelvic floor muscles. This is often referred to as stress incontinence—leakage that happens with activities like coughing, sneezing, or laughing. Fortunately, there are several treatment options available, and surgery isn’t always the first step. We can start with some conservative measures, such as pelvic floor exercises—also known as Kegel exercises—to strengthen the muscles. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications, like limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, which can irritate the bladder. In some cases, a pessary—a small device inserted into the vagina to support the bladder—can be helpful. We can discuss whether that's a good option for you. If those measures aren't effective, we can consider other options, such as physical therapy or, as a last resort, surgery. However, we’ll start with the least invasive options first. Would you like me to explain the Kegel exercises in more detail?
PATIENT: Kegel exercises… sounds like hard work. And I'm not very good at remembering things. But… alright. If it doesn’t involve cutting me open, I'll try. But explain it slowly, please. And tell me how often I need to do them. And what if I forget? Will that make it worse? I just want a simple solution. Is there a pill I can take?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Jimmi. We'll start with the simplest steps first. Kegel exercises are not difficult, and you can do them anywhere, anytime. Think of it like squeezing the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. Squeeze those muscles, hold for a few seconds, then relax. It’s important to focus on squeezing only those muscles—don’t squeeze your abdomen or legs. We'll start with three sets of ten squeezes each day. You can do them while sitting, standing, or lying down. Try to do them at regular intervals throughout the day. If you forget a day, that's perfectly okay. Just try to get back to it as soon as you remember. It won't make things worse. Consistency is more important than perfection. It takes time to see results—usually several weeks or months—but with regular exercise, you should notice some improvement. Regarding a pill, there are some medications available that can help with stress incontinence, but they often have side effects, and they’re not always effective. Given your history, I’d prefer to start with the conservative measures—the pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle modifications—and see how you respond. I can provide you with a handout with instructions on how to do the Kegel exercises correctly. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you’re doing and discuss any concerns you may have. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: A handout… that would be good. I always forget things. And a follow-up appointment… yes, that's a good idea. I'll probably need reminding. Just… don't make it too soon. I need time to… get things organized. And… are you sure surgery is the last resort? I've heard terrible stories. Oh, and one more thing… is this covered by… anything? I don't have much money.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. We can absolutely schedule the follow-up appointment a few weeks out—let's say August 30th?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright. August 30th. Yes. And… is there anything I need to do before then? Besides the squeezing? I have to go to the store tomorrow. Should I get something? Or… no, don't tell me. I'll just forget.
DOCTOR: No, Jimmi, there's nothing else you need to do before then except try to do the pelvic floor exercises as best as you can. Don't worry about getting anything from the store. We’ll take things one step at a time. Now, regarding your question about coverage, unfortunately, without insurance, the costs can be a challenge. I can have our office staff provide you with a detailed cost estimate for the visit and any potential further tests or treatments. We also have information about some local resources that may offer financial assistance. I'll have the staff print out the handout with the Kegel exercise instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment for August 30th. They can also discuss the cost estimate and available resources with you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… patient. Even though I'm a terrible patient. Just… don't let me forget about the appointment, alright? And tell the staff to explain the costs slowly. I get confused easily. Oh, and one last thing… is it okay if I call if I forget how to do the squeezing?
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. You are not a terrible patient at all. It's perfectly normal to have questions and concerns, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. I’ll make a note to remind you about the appointment, and I’ll ask the staff to explain the costs slowly and clearly. And absolutely, please feel free to call if you forget how to do the squeezing. My staff is always here to help, and I'm happy to review the exercises with you again over the phone. Here’s the handout and the appointment card. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Jimmi. I look forward to seeing you on August 30th.
