DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been having in my side, mostly on my right. And… I keep getting these water infections, you see? They’re quite bothersome, really. It seems to happen quite a bit these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Espinueva. Right-sided pain and frequent urinary tract infections – that does sound bothersome. Let's gather a bit more detail about both of those concerns. To start with the pain, could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, not exactly. More of a dull ache, a heavy feeling. It comes and goes, you see? Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s quite uncomfortable. It doesn’t radiate, as far as I can tell – it just stays in my side, mostly. It's been happening for… oh, I suppose a good few months now, maybe six or so. I haven’t done anything to cause it, if that makes sense. It just… is.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Espinueva. A dull, constant ache for about six months, localized to your right side, and not triggered by any specific injury or activity. I appreciate you clarifying that. Now, regarding these urinary tract infections… how often would you say you're experiencing them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a bit hard to say exactly. It feels like… every few months, at least. Sometimes sooner, sometimes a little longer. I always get a burning sensation when I go to the toilet, and I have to go very frequently. My daughter usually reminds me to go to the chemist when she visits. I haven’t kept a strict count, I’m afraid. It’s just… a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. “A nuisance” is a good way to put it, but frequent UTIs can certainly be more than that. And it's good your daughter helps you to stay on top of things. To help me get a clearer picture, could you recall when you last completed a course of antibiotics for a UTI?
PATIENT: Let me think… antibiotics… That would have been… oh, just last month, I believe. Yes, July. It was a short course, just a few days, like usual. The chemist knows me quite well now, sadly. It seemed to clear it up, but I have this feeling it's coming back again. The burning started yesterday, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. So, you completed a course of antibiotics in July for a UTI, and you’re starting to experience symptoms again – burning sensation started yesterday. That’s important information. Now, let’s briefly touch on your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Well, the doctor years ago – quite a few years ago now – he told me I had something to do with my kidneys. Polycystic… that’s the word, I think. Polycystic kidney disease. He said it runs in the family. I don't really… well, I haven’t had much trouble with it until recently, you see? Just the pain and these water infections. Nothing else, not that I know of. I don’t have any trouble with my blood pressure or sugar, as far as I'm aware.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Espinueva. Polycystic kidney disease is important to know, and the recent increase in pain and UTIs could certainly be related. Do you recall if you've had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Not that I can recall, anyway. Nothing major, certainly. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a very long time ago, but that’s about it. Nothing else. I’ve always been quite lucky, health-wise, until… well, until recently.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all, really. Just a bit of paracetamol now and then for the pain, when it gets too bad. And I take a multivitamin, you know, just to keep me going. My daughter buys it for me. Nothing else, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly, not even for a cold, usually. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Espinueva. Just paracetamol as needed and a multivitamin. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything, thankfully. My daughter always asks when she takes me to the chemist, and I always tell her ‘no’, and she says I’m a lucky man. I suppose I am, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Espinueva. No known allergies. Alright, thank you for answering those questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your blood pressure, and possibly palpating your sides to check for tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table, if you would. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, but I do detect some tenderness in your right flank – the side where you’ve been experiencing the pain. It's not severe, but it's definitely present. There's also a mild degree of tenderness along your right costovertebral angle - that's the bony area on your back, towards your side. Do you feel any pain when I press there?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! That’s where it hurts, Doctor. Just a little bit, but definitely there. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, like the pain in my side. It’s been worse lately, I think. You’re right to feel that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Espinueva. That’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me – the recurrent UTIs, the right-sided pain, the tenderness in your flank and back, and your history of polycystic kidney disease – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be related to the cysts in your kidneys, potentially causing obstruction or infection. It’s also possible you're experiencing a kidney infection, despite recent antibiotic treatment. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to check for infection. I also want to order a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Finally, I'd like to order an imaging scan of your kidneys – likely a CT scan – to visualize the cysts and rule out any blockages or other abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like quite a few tests, Doctor. A CT scan… is that the one where I have to lie in that big machine? I’ve heard stories… I suppose if you think it’s necessary… what exactly will these tests show? Will they tell me how bad the kidney disease is? And… will I need to do anything special to prepare for them? I don’t want to be a bother, you see.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask questions, Mr. Espinueva, and it's good you're expressing your concerns. A CT scan is the one where you lie in a large, donut-shaped machine. It's a non-invasive procedure, and while there is a small amount of radiation exposure, the benefits of obtaining this information outweigh the risks in your case. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your kidneys in detail, showing the size and number of cysts, whether there are any blockages in the urinary tract, and whether there are any signs of infection or other abnormalities. The urine analysis and culture will tell us if you currently have an infection and what type of bacteria is causing it. The complete blood count will look for signs of inflammation, which can indicate an infection or other medical problem. The basic metabolic panel will assess your kidney function, giving us an idea of how well your kidneys are working. As for preparation, for the urine analysis and culture, you’ll simply need to provide a urine sample. For the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drink other than water. The CT scan may require you to drink some contrast dye beforehand to help visualize the kidneys more clearly, and we’ll give you specific instructions about that when we schedule the appointment. I understand it sounds like a lot, but it’s important to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Does that clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. Fasting… I can manage that. And the dye… well, I suppose I can handle that too, if it’s necessary. So, what happens after the tests? When will I get the results? And… what if it is something serious with the kidneys? Will I need to go to the hospital? I worry about these things, you see. I’m an old man, and I don’t bounce back like I used to.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It’s perfectly natural to be worried, and I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time. Once the tests are completed, the results typically take a few days to come back. I’ll review them carefully and contact you immediately to discuss the findings. If the tests reveal something serious with your kidneys, such as a blockage or significant infection, we may need to consider further treatment options. This could include antibiotics, medications to manage your kidney function, or, in some cases, a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist. In rare cases, hospitalization may be necessary, but we will discuss all of these options with you in detail before making any decisions. I want to emphasize that we don't know the extent of your kidney disease yet, and it's possible the tests will show only minor abnormalities. I'm here to support you throughout this process and answer any questions you may have. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests scheduled. I’ll have my assistant schedule them for you, and she’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, severe flank pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact my office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, and for not rushing me. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what to expect. Please do have your assistant schedule those tests for me, and I’ll do my best to follow the instructions. And yes, I will contact your office if anything gets worse. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was my pleasure to meet you and address your concerns. I'm glad I was able to put your mind at ease, even just a little. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, Mr. Espinueva. And please take care.
