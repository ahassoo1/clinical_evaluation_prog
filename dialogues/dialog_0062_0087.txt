DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Croonquist, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said. Something about needing it done. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. A lot of things just… slip my mind these days. Can we just get it over with?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. It sounds like you're scheduled for some routine bloodwork. We can definitely get that taken care of. But just to be sure, and to get a good picture of your overall health, would you mind if I ask a few quick questions?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Look, I’m not a big fan of talking about things, if you don’t mind. Is it absolutely necessary? I just want the lab work done, and then I can be on my way. I have… things to do. It’s probably nothing serious, honestly. Just old age.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. I promise to be brief. A few questions just help me understand your general health and make sure the lab results are interpreted correctly. It really won't take long. We can focus on what's most important to you today. Perhaps we can start with why you think the lady on the phone scheduled the lab work?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. She just said my name and a date. Something about a check-up… or maybe it was a follow-up? I really don’t remember. I’ve been to a lot of doctors over the years, you see. They all start to blend together after a while. Is this a new clinic? It looks… modern.
DOCTOR: It is a newer clinic, you’re right. We opened about six months ago. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember – it happens! Okay. Well, since you’re not sure why you’re here, let’s start with a general check-in. Have you been feeling okay lately?
PATIENT: Okay… feeling okay… hmm. Let me think. I get tired easily, I suppose. And my knees ache. They’ve been aching for… well, a long time. It’s just part of getting old, isn’t it? Nothing to worry about. I still manage to get around, though. I used to work at the power plant… a long time ago. But I’m retired now. Mostly just stay at home. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. And yes, that’s exactly the kind of thing I want to know. So, the knee pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Worse when it’s cold, or if I’ve been walking a lot. Not excruciating pain, just… a dull ache. I try not to think about it too much. It’s just… annoying. Look, I really need to get this lab work done. Are we any closer to that? I don't mean to rush you, but… I have a bit of a schedule.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Croonquist. We are getting closer. Just a few more quick questions, and then we’ll get you set up for the lab work. Okay, besides the knee pain and fatigue, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Let me see. I… well, sometimes I feel a bit… confused. Like I’m losing my train of thought. You were asking me something, weren't you? Oh dear, it’s happening again. It’s just little things. I forget where I put my keys, or the name of that actor… you know, the one in all the westerns. It's frustrating, I tell you. Really frustrating. But nothing major. Just… old age. Can we please just get on with it? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: We absolutely can get to the lab work, Mr. Croonquist. And I understand your anxiety—it’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way when you're not sure what's going on. You’re describing some memory issues, and some confusion, and that's good information for me to have. Before we proceed, just to be thorough, have you had any recent falls?
PATIENT: Falls… no, not recently. Maybe a stumble or two, but nothing serious. I’m pretty steady on my feet, all things considered. Used to be a very active man, you see. Worked with machines my whole life. Good balance. No, no recent falls. Look, Doctor, are you writing all this down? It feels like an interrogation! I just want the lab work, and then I'd like to go home. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Croonquist. And I apologize if it feels like an interrogation – that’s not my intention. I’m just trying to gather enough information to make sure we get the right results from the lab work and understand what's going on with your health. Okay. Let's take a little break from the questions. We’ll get the lab work done shortly. First, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and a few other basic things. Would that be alright?
