DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… Bacy, you said? Yes, well, it’s about this letter. For a pet, you see. My niece, she needs it. Something about… proving I own a dog? Honestly, paperwork. It’s always paperwork these days. I don’t really remember all the details, though. She just said I needed a doctor to sign something. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wrye, I see here you have a request for a verification of pet ownership. That's…not a typical appointment, but we can certainly help if we can. To do that accurately, could you tell me a little bit about your dog?
PATIENT: A dog, yes. Well, it’s a…a medium-sized one. Brown, I think. Mostly brown. A bit fluffy. Honestly, my niece handles most of the dog stuff. I just…have it. It lives with her, mostly. She said something about needing proof for…an apartment, maybe? I really don’t pay attention to these things. It’s a good dog, though. Quiet. Doesn’t bother anyone. Is that enough? I don’t really know what you need to verify, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s helpful to know your niece is primarily responsible for the dog's care. To be sure I can complete the form accurately, and to rule out anything else going on, could you tell me how long you've had the dog?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… That’s a tricky one. It feels like…a while. Several years, definitely. Maybe three? Or four? It was after… after David moved out, I think. Yes, after David. That narrows it down. He left in… 2021, wasn’t it? So, it must be around then. I just…don’t keep track of dates like that. It’s a dog, Doctor. Not a…a momentous occasion. Why does it matter so much?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Wrye. I understand it can be difficult to remember exact dates. I'm just trying to get a clear picture. Knowing when you acquired the dog is helpful for the verification. Do you remember where you got the dog from?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where… Honestly, I think it was from… someone local. A woman, I think. She had a litter of puppies. My niece found her online, I believe. Or maybe through a friend? It was…a whole thing. I mostly just provided the money, and then the dog showed up. I don’t really remember meeting the woman, to be honest. It was all very quick. She said it was a good breed, something about…not shedding much. Is the breed important? I just know it’s brown and fluffy. Really, my niece knows all of this better than I do. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing that. Ms. Wrye, I’m a little concerned about your difficulty recalling these details. While we can complete the pet ownership verification, I also want to make sure you're feeling okay and that your memory is functioning as it should. Have you noticed any other difficulties with your memory recently, perhaps forgetting appointments or having trouble finding the right words?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, now you mention it… yes. Sometimes. I do forget things. Not big things, usually. Just…names. And where I put my glasses. And what I went into the kitchen for. It happens. It's just getting older, I suppose. David used to say I was always forgetful, even when we were younger. He had a very good memory, that one. Always remembering things I’d done wrong. It’s probably just…normal. Really, I'm perfectly fine. I just need a bit of help sometimes. This letter is more trouble than it's worth, honestly. Can we just get it signed, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wrye. We can certainly complete the verification form. However, given your reports of memory difficulties, I do recommend a brief cognitive screening to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It’s a simple test, and it could help us identify any underlying issues. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A test? Oh, goodness. I really don't do well with tests. David always said I froze up. And what good would a test do, anyway? I'm just forgetful, that's all. It's not something you fix, is it? Look, I just need the letter signed. My niece is relying on me. Can’t we just…skip the test and get it done? I’m sure it’s nothing serious. It’s just a dog, Doctor. Just a brown, fluffy dog. Please? I really don’t want to spend all day here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wrye. I understand your hesitation. I won’t force you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. However, I do want to ensure your well-being. Since you're resistant to a formal test, I’m going to proceed with completing the pet ownership verification, but I strongly recommend you discuss these memory concerns with your primary care physician. They can perform a more thorough evaluation and address any potential issues. Would you like me to help you find a list of primary care physicians in the area?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be…kind, actually. Yes, please. Finding doctors is such a hassle these days. Always so many forms. And waiting on hold. Honestly, it's exhausting. If you could just give me a list, that would be wonderful. And then, if you could just sign the letter… that would be the best thing of all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been…patient with me, at least. I appreciate that. Now, about that letter…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. Here is a list of primary care physicians in the area. They all accept your insurance. Here is the signed verification form. I've also made a note that I recommend a consultation with your primary care physician to discuss your memory concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. This is…exactly what my niece needed. You've been a lifesaver, truly. No, I don’t think that’s all. I just… wanted to get this done. Honestly, paperwork is the worst. Thank you again for your patience. And for signing the letter. I really appreciate it. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I’m glad I could help. Please do schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your memory. It’s always best to get these things checked out. Have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. .
