DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t usually do this, frankly. But… family history, you know? My mother’s side… it’s not pretty. Lots of… things. I just want to be sure I’m okay. Preventative stuff, I guess. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I see. A proactive approach is… commendable, though often unnecessary in individuals your age. Nevertheless, family history is relevant. “Lots of things” is rather vague, however. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Okay, fine. Heart issues, mostly. My grandmother died young, a heart attack. And my aunt… she had some kind of valve problem, needed surgery. My mother has high blood pressure, always on medication. It’s just… a lot of heart stuff. And honestly, I don’t know the details beyond that. They don't really talk about it. It's… unpleasant. But it makes me nervous, you know? I feel like I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.
DOCTOR: Yes, a family history of cardiovascular disease certainly warrants attention. While it doesn’t guarantee you’ll experience the same issues, it does increase your risk. We will, of course, proceed with a thorough evaluation. Beyond the cardiovascular concerns, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. No cancers, no… weird genetic stuff, nothing like that. My dad’s side is pretty boring, actually. Healthy as horses, all of them. It's really just my mother's side that's… problematic. Honestly, I’m probably being paranoid. But it's better to know, right? I'd rather be safe than… well, you know.
DOCTOR: “Paranoid” is a rather strong term. Prudent, perhaps. Very well. Let’s focus on your health then. Do you currently experience any symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing like that. I’m pretty active, actually. I teach engineering – lots of walking around the labs, demonstrating things. I try to eat reasonably well, though sometimes it’s just grabbing something quick. But no… no symptoms. That’s why I’m here, right? Before anything starts. It feels… foolish, coming in when I feel fine. But better safe, like I said.
DOCTOR: It is never foolish to prioritize preventative care, Mr. Theriot, despite what others may suggest. While your current lack of symptoms is reassuring, it does not eliminate the need for assessment. We will begin with a physical examination and a review of your medical history. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. It’s been… a while. I think when I got divorced, my insurance lapsed for a bit, and I just… didn’t bother getting one. It's Medicare now, but even then I haven't really needed to. I’m relatively young, right? Healthy. Not exactly who doctors expect to see for a check-up. Though, clearly, I am now. So… where do we start? Blood pressure, I guess?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Blood pressure is an excellent starting point. Then we will listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your pulse, and assess your overall physical condition. Do you have any allergies to medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Nothing serious, anyway. I get a bit sniffly sometimes with pollen, but that’s it. No reactions to any medications I’ve ever taken, and I've had… the usual things. Antibiotics, pain relievers, that sort of thing. Nothing memorable. Is that all? Can we just get this over with? I have classes this afternoon. Not that my time is more valuable than anyone else's, but... you know. Schedules.
DOCTOR: Very well. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Acceptable, but we will monitor it over time. Now, please remove your shirt and lie back on the examination table. I will auscultate your heart and lungs. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never. Makes no sense, right? Especially with my family history. Complete waste of time and money. And bad for you. Seriously, why would anyone do that? Just… get on with it, please. The sooner this is over…
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is 72 and regular. I will now palpate your abdomen and assess your peripheral pulses. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… the usual caffeine to stay awake grading papers. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no anything. I eat reasonably well, I exercise, I don’t smoke… honestly, I’m a pretty boring patient, Doctor. You’re probably disappointed. This is… awkward. Can I get dressed now?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Given your family history, I recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm and detect any subtle abnormalities. It's a simple, non-invasive test. Would you consent to that?
PATIENT: An EKG? Fine, whatever you think is best. If it’ll make me feel better, sure. Honestly, I just want to get this over with and know I’m not about to drop dead. Just… tell me what happens. I don’t like surprises. Is it painful? Do I have to… you know?
DOCTOR: It is a completely painless procedure, Mr. Theriot. Small electrodes will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes only a few minutes. No undressing required. You will simply lie still while the machine records the data. A technician will perform the test. While we wait for the results, do you have any questions regarding your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? Look, I’m divorced. I live alone. I teach engineering. I don’t really have a social life, if that’s what you’re asking. I mean, I have colleagues, but… it's work. I don't go to bars or clubs, or… anything like that. I mostly just grade papers and worry about my mother’s health. Is that what you want to know? It’s not very interesting.
DOCTOR: I inquire about your lifestyle habits, Mr. Theriot. Do you consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. Certainly not enough to… you know, cause problems. I'm not a drinker, really. It's just… sometimes. To relax. With food. Is that a problem? Honestly, you're making me feel like I'm some kind of degenerate.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally considered acceptable. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious right now? Look at me, Doctor. Do I look like someone who uses recreational drugs? I teach engineering! I’m responsible. I have… had responsibilities. This is ridiculous. I’m here because I’m worried about my heart, not because I have a secret life as a… a drug addict! Honestly, I think I’m wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us focus on the EKG results. The EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST-segment changes. However, there is evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. This can be caused by a number of factors, including hypertension and strenuous physical activity. Given your family history, and the left ventricular hypertrophy, I recommend a follow-up echocardiogram to assess your heart structure and function more comprehensively.
PATIENT: Left ventricular… what? Look, I don't speak doctor. What does that mean? Is it bad? Is it serious? Is it… am I going to die? Don't just throw medical terms at me. Explain it. In English. And slowly.
DOCTOR: Left ventricular hypertrophy means your heart muscle is thickened. As I mentioned, this can be caused by a number of things, including high blood pressure, or simply from exercising regularly. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is a problem right now, but it warrants further investigation, given your family history of heart disease. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of your heart. It’s a non-invasive test that will give us a more detailed picture of its structure and function. We need to rule out any underlying issues. It is unlikely to be immediately life-threatening, but it is important to address it proactively.
PATIENT: Proactively. Right. That's what I said. But... another test? Seriously? Isn't there anything else you can do? Blood work? Something? I have classes tomorrow, Doctor. And grading. I can't just spend all my time in doctor's offices. Look, I appreciate you checking things out, but... this is getting ridiculous. Is it definitely necessary? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Blood work would be prudent, yes. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid profile. However, the echocardiogram is the most crucial test in this situation. It will provide definitive information about your heart structure and function, and guide our treatment plan. We will schedule both tests, Mr. Theriot. The echocardiogram can be done at the imaging center across the street. It usually takes about an hour. I understand your concerns regarding your schedule, but your health takes precedence. I will provide you with a referral for the echocardiogram, and a lab order for the blood work. Are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations at this time?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Like I said. Perfectly fine. Just… anxious. And inconvenienced. This is all very… disruptive. Fine. Schedule the tests. I guess. But if they find something… what then? Surgery? Medication? I don’t do well with uncertainty, Doctor. I need to know what I'm facing. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Should the tests reveal any abnormalities, we will discuss all available treatment options, including medication, lifestyle modifications, and, if necessary, further interventions. It’s premature to discuss specific procedures at this stage. The goal is to identify any potential problems early on and prevent further complications. Here is the referral for the echocardiogram, and the lab order for the blood work. The lab is located next door to the imaging center. I recommend scheduling both appointments as soon as possible. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to review the results. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… schedule the tests. Get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day, Mr. Theriot.
