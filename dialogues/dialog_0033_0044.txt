DOCTOR: Right. Calin Sachar. 28 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Dechêne. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’m here about getting assessed for… home health care, or hospice, if needed. It’s a bit difficult to talk about, honestly. I’m not entirely sure what the process is, or if I even qualify.
DOCTOR: Hospice… already. Very well. And what makes you think you might qualify for hospice?
PATIENT: It's my mother, Doctor. She’s been… very unwell for some time now. The doctors at the hospital said it's… well, they said her condition isn’t getting better, and it’s more about keeping her comfortable now. I’m trying to figure out if she’d be eligible for care at home, or if hospice is the right step. I’m her only child, and I'm trying to do everything I can. I just… I don’t know much about any of this.
DOCTOR: "Keeping her comfortable." A vague term. Do you have a specific diagnosis I can review?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… It’s… advanced pancreatic cancer. She was diagnosed about six months ago. They did try chemotherapy, but it wasn’t very effective. It actually made her feel quite ill, so they stopped it a few weeks back. It’s… it’s been downhill since then. I have all the reports here, if you need them.
DOCTOR: Pancreatic cancer, stage… well, never mind. Six months post-diagnosis. And what specific symptoms is she experiencing now that are causing you concern?
PATIENT: Right, now… The biggest thing is the pain, Doctor. It's in her abdomen mostly, and it's very difficult to manage, even with the medication. She's also very weak, hardly eating anything at all. She’s… she’s sleeping a lot more, and when she is awake, she’s very confused sometimes. She doesn't recognise me half the time, and that’s… hard. And she's short of breath, even when she's just sitting still. It's frightening to watch.
DOCTOR: Pain, weakness, confusion, dyspnea… all predictable, unfortunately. Has she been evaluated recently – within the last week – for any infections, or changes in her electrolytes?
PATIENT: Oh yes, she was at the hospital just last Tuesday. They did blood work then, and a chest x-ray. The doctor said her potassium was a little low, so they adjusted her medication for that. They didn’t find any infection, thankfully. They said the shortness of breath was likely related to the cancer itself, and maybe a little fluid buildup, but they didn’t think it needed immediate draining. I have the discharge papers here too, if that helps. It’s a bit of a mess, sorry. I’ve been… distracted.
DOCTOR: Details, details. Let me ask: Is she currently under the care of an oncologist?
PATIENT: Yes, she is. Dr. Anya Sharma at City General. She’s a very good doctor, very kind, but… she's very busy, and it’s difficult to get a lot of face time with her. That’s why I thought it might be helpful to explore home health care, or hospice, to have more support at home. It's just… a lot to manage on my own.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what exactly do you hope to achieve with hospice, Ms. Sachar?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I want to make her as comfortable as possible, for however long she has left. I want her to be able to spend her final days at home, surrounded by… peace, if that makes sense. I want to be able to care for her, but I also need help, and I need to know I’m doing everything right. And… honestly, I need help preparing for what’s coming. It’s… scary, thinking about it. I just want to make sure she's not in pain, and that she feels loved and supported. Is that… too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not… unreasonable. However, hospice is very specific. We require a prognosis of six months or less, with documented decline. Do you have documentation from Dr. Sharma outlining that prognosis?
PATIENT: That’s… that’s what I was worried about. I don't think so, not specifically. She said things weren't looking good, and that we should prepare, but I don't think she gave a written prognosis. She's very careful about making definitive statements, I think. She said it was difficult to predict exactly how long, given my mother’s overall health. She focused more on managing the symptoms and keeping her comfortable, rather than… a timeline. I was hoping that the hospital records might be enough?
DOCTOR: “Might be enough” isn’t sufficient for hospice eligibility, Ms. Sachar. Frankly, you’ll need a formal prognosis from Dr. Sharma. Without it, we can discuss palliative care, perhaps some support services… but hospice requires a much higher level of documentation. I can refer you to a palliative care specialist if you wish. It would be best to get a clear statement from her oncologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. It’s just… frustrating. I was hoping to have some options, something to help us now. I suppose I need to go back to Dr. Sharma and… ask her specifically for that prognosis. It feels… awkward, to put it mildly. Would you mind if I came back with that documentation, if I can get it? And we could discuss hospice again then?
DOCTOR: Very well. Bring the documentation from Dr. Sharma. Documented prognosis. And perhaps a complete list of her current medications. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Sachar. I’m afraid I can’t spend any further time on this without proper information. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Dechêne. I will. I appreciate your time. I'll try to get that documentation as soon as possible. Have a good day.
