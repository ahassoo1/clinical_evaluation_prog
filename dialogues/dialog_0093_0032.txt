DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well, I suppose. It’s… well, it’s a delicate matter. A rather unpleasant matter, actually. I’ve noticed… a discharge. Yes, a discharge. It's been going on for… oh, goodness, I couldn’t say exactly how long. A while. It’s bothersome, naturally. And quite undignified for a man of my age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It sounds quite distressing, and you are right to seek medical attention. It’s certainly nothing to be embarrassed about, and we will get to the bottom of this together. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good heavens. Well… it’s… liquidy. That much I can tell you. And… not a pleasant colour, I’m afraid. A sort of… yellowish-grey, perhaps? Though my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. It’s also… smelly. Rather distinctly so. My wife, bless her heart, was the one who first pointed it out. She has a very keen nose, you see. I wouldn't have noticed it myself, probably. I’ve been trying to keep things… clean, of course. But it persists. It's most noticeable after… well, after relieving myself. Is that… too much information? I apologize.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Krok. Providing detailed information is exactly what I need to understand the situation properly. You are doing very well. So, it's a yellowish-grey, liquid discharge, with an odour, and you notice it primarily after urination. Is it accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… no fever, I don’t believe. And no pain, thankfully. Not when I… urinate, or at any other time, for that matter. Though… sometimes, just a slight… burning sensation. Very slight. Barely noticeable. I thought it might just be the soap. And… oh, yes. A bit of itching, occasionally. Down there, naturally. But nothing severe. It comes and goes. I’ve been using a bit of talcum powder, which helps a little. My wife suggested that, you see. She’s a very practical woman. Do you need me to be more… specific about the location? Perhaps a diagram? This is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krok, a diagram isn’t necessary. You’ve described it perfectly well. So, to summarise: yellowish-grey discharge, odour, slight burning sensation occasionally, and intermittent itching. No fever or pain. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted infections? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I’ve been married for fifty-two years, you know. A very long time. A devoted marriage. My wife and I… well, let’s just say we’ve been very careful. As for other conditions… I had a bit of trouble with my prostate a few years back. The doctor said it was enlarged. I took some pills for it. They helped, I think. And my blood pressure is a little high, but nothing to worry about. I take medication for that as well. I see Dr. Ahmadi, down the street. A very good man. Though, admittedly, he’s not very good at explaining things. Always rushing about. And… oh, yes. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very serious operation, it was. Back in Iran. They didn’t have all the fancy equipment they have here, you know. Is that… helpful? I'm trying to recall everything. It's been a long life.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very helpful, Mr. Krok. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. So, to clarify: fifty-two-year marriage, history of enlarged prostate treated with medication, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a childhood appendectomy. Now, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, and what dosages?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Dosages… that’s where it gets tricky. My wife manages all that, you see. She has a very good system. Let me see… I take a little white pill every morning for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a larger, yellow pill for the prostate. Tamsulosin, perhaps? And… oh, yes. A small blue pill for my cholesterol. Atorvastatin, I believe. She keeps a list, of course. But I haven’t looked at it in… goodness, I don’t know how long. She’s very organised. I can ask her when I get home, if you'd like. I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information. She’s much better at remembering these things. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It’s very common to have difficulty remembering medication details, and it’s excellent that your wife manages that for you. We can certainly verify the dosages with her if you’d like. For now, knowing the names of the medications is a good start. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks before giving me anything, of course. She’s very cautious. She’s a wonderful woman, truly. I can’t imagine life without her. I once had a bit of a rash after eating some shellfish, years ago. But that was just a mild irritation. And I’m not particularly fond of peanuts, but that’s just a matter of taste, not an allergy. I used to eat dates every day, but I stopped because they upset my stomach. Is that… relevant? I’m trying to be as helpful as possible, but my memory is failing me. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Perhaps you should just ask my wife. She knows everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It sounds like you don’t have any significant allergies, which is good to know. And it's very wise of your wife to be cautious. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a gentle examination of your abdomen and, with your permission, the area where you’ve been experiencing the discharge. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… hmm. Well, I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? Though I must admit, I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded. It’s rather undignified, you see. But if it will help… yes, alright. Go ahead. But please be gentle. And… perhaps you could explain what you’re doing as you go along? I like to know what’s happening. And… my wife always says I’m a bit of a hypochondriac. She thinks I worry too much. But it’s better to be safe than sorry, isn’t it? Yes, go ahead. But please be gentle. And explain everything as you go. It’s rather… sensitive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns completely, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I will explain everything as I go along. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort there. A little… pressure, perhaps. But nothing painful. My wife always says I have a bit of a potbelly. She says it’s from all the dates I used to eat. But it’s just… normal. A little soft, perhaps. But nothing to worry about. Go ahead. But please be gentle. It’s rather… sensitive, you understand. And… are you finding anything? Is it something serious? My wife always worries, you see. She’s a very anxious woman. But she’s a good woman. A very good woman. Are you finding anything? Please be honest. Even if it’s not good news. I’d rather know.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen feels soft and non-tender, Mr. Krok. No masses or abnormalities detected. Now, with your permission, I’d like to examine the genital area. This will involve a visual inspection and gentle palpation of the area where you’ve been experiencing the discharge. I will, of course, maintain your privacy and dignity throughout the examination. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time.
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That… that’s rather… personal, isn’t it? I suppose it’s necessary, if you’re going to diagnose the problem. But I must admit, I’m not entirely comfortable with it. It’s rather… undignified, you see. But… alright. Go ahead. But please be quick. And gentle. Very gentle. And… perhaps you could explain what you’re looking for? I like to know what’s happening. And… please try not to make me feel too… embarrassed. It’s rather… sensitive, you understand. And… if it’s something serious, please be honest. Even if it’s not good news. My wife… well, she’ll be very worried. Yes, go ahead. But please be quick. And gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I completely understand your discomfort, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will explain everything as I go along. I observe some mild redness and slight swelling around the urethral opening. There appears to be a small amount of discharge present. The surrounding tissue is tender to the touch. Based on this initial examination, the findings suggest a possible urethritis, which is an inflammation of the urethra. However, it’s important to determine the cause of the inflammation. To do that, I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection, and possibly a swab to identify any specific bacteria or other organisms that may be present. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Urethritis… that sounds… unpleasant. Is it serious? Will I need… injections? My wife always worries about injections. She says they make me grumpy. A urine test… yes, that’s alright. I can manage that. And a swab… well, I suppose if you need it. Is it… painful? My wife always says I have a low pain threshold. She says I exaggerate everything. But it’s better to be safe than sorry, isn’t it? Yes, go ahead with the tests. Whatever it takes to find out what’s wrong. And… will you explain the results to me in plain English? I don’t understand all that medical jargon. And… what kind of treatment will I need? Will it be a long process? My wife… well, she’s very anxious. She’ll want to know everything. Yes, go ahead with the tests. But please explain everything in plain English. And be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will explain everything in plain English, and I will be as gentle as possible. The urine test and swab are relatively simple procedures. The urine test involves providing a sample in a sterile cup, and the swab involves a quick and gentle collection of a small sample from the urethral opening. Neither should be particularly painful, though you may experience some mild discomfort. Based on the test results, we can determine the cause of the urethritis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. This may involve antibiotics or other medications to clear the infection. The length of treatment will depend on the specific cause of the infection. While we await the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids to help flush out your system. It’s also important to avoid any sexual activity until we have a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No sexual activity… oh dear. My wife will be… disappointed. She’s a very… active woman. But I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, isn’t it? Drinking plenty of fluids… yes, I can manage that. I always have a glass of water with my meals. And… is it contagious? Will my wife need to be tested as well? She’s very anxious, you see. She worries about everything. And… what if it’s something… serious? What if it’s… cancer? My uncle had cancer, you see. It was a very… unpleasant experience. And… will this be covered by Medicare? I’m a bit worried about the cost. I’m on a fixed income, you see. Yes, those are my questions. Please be honest. Even if it’s not good news. And… please explain everything in plain English. And be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Mr. Krok, and I’m happy to address them. First, regarding contagiousness, some causes of urethritis are sexually transmitted, while others are not. We need the test results to determine the cause and assess the risk to your wife. If it is a sexually transmitted infection, we will need to discuss testing and treatment for her as well. Regarding the possibility of cancer, it’s important to remember that urethritis itself is rarely a sign of cancer. However, we will consider that possibility if the symptoms don’t improve with treatment, or if the test results raise any concerns. We will do everything necessary to rule out any serious underlying conditions. And finally, regarding cost, the urine test and swab are typically covered by Medicare. We will verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate of any out-of-pocket expenses before proceeding with any further testing or treatment. For now, let’s focus on getting the test results back. I will order the tests immediately, and we should have them back within a few days. I will contact you as soon as they are available to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, please drink plenty of fluids and avoid any sexual activity. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very… thorough. And you’ve explained everything in plain English, which I appreciate. My wife will be very pleased. She always worries about getting the right information. You’re a very… kind doctor. My previous doctor wasn’t very good at explaining things. He always rushed about and didn’t listen to my concerns. You’ve been very patient and understanding. Thank you. I suppose I’ll be going now. I have to tell my wife about the tests. She’ll want to know everything. And… thank you again. For everything. And… please be gentle. Very gentle. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I’m glad I could provide you with some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before we receive the test results. And please, do give your wife my best. I understand her anxieties, and I assure you, we will do everything possible to get to the bottom of this and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Have a good day, Mr. Krok. And please remember, we are here to support you both. .
