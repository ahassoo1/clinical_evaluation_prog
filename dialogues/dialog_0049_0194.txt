DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MayHugh. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… it’s my hearing, I think. It comes and goes, and when it does, everything spins. It’s… hard to explain. My daughter, Lani, she filled out most of the paperwork, bless her. I forget things easily these days. It runs in the family, this hearing trouble. My husband… he had it too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hearing trouble that comes and goes, and dizziness when it occurs. And family history of hearing issues, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My husband, Josaia… he needed hearing aids for years. And his mother, too, I think. It wasn’t as bad for him as it gets for me sometimes, though. It’s just… unsettling, you know? The spinning… and then everything sounds muffled. It doesn’t last long, usually, just a few hours, but it's scary when it happens. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: A few hours, alright. And this muffled hearing… is that consistent, or only during these episodes with the dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… mostly during the dizzy spells. When it’s not happening, my hearing is… well, I’m an older woman, Doctor. It's not what it used to be, naturally. But it’s much worse when everything spins. It’s hard to hold a conversation, even with Lani, and she speaks so clearly. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things somewhat. So, the hearing loss is more pronounced with the dizziness. And it’s intermittent… comes and goes. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. That’s a good question. I honestly haven’t noticed anything specific. Sometimes it happens when I’m resting, sometimes when I’m out shopping with Lani. I don’t know. Maybe stress? I worry a lot, you know, being alone since Josaia passed. But it’s just a feeling, I can’t say for sure. It’s so random. I wish I could tell you something useful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No clear triggers identified. And you mentioned stress since your husband passed… that’s good to know. Now, aside from the hearing and dizziness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… sometimes I feel a little bit off balance, even when I’m not spinning. Just a little wobbly, like I might fall. But I haven’t actually fallen, thankfully. And… oh! Sometimes a ringing in my ears. Not always, but it happens. Is that important? It’s not a loud ringing, just a… faint hum.
DOCTOR: Alright, imbalance even when not actively dizzy, and tinnitus – that's the ringing in your ears – occasionally. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting during these episodes, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. No nausea or vomiting. I might feel a little bit sick to my stomach when I’m spinning, but I’ve never actually thrown up. Just… very uncomfortable. And scared, mostly. I worry it’s something serious, you know? It’s just… unsettling to lose your balance and not know why.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea or vomiting. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, the doctor told me. But I take a pill for that, every morning. And… I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. Mostly just a little stiff sometimes. Otherwise… I think that’s it. I try to stay healthy. I walk when I can, and eat my fruits and vegetables. Lani worries about me, always making sure I’m taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication, and some arthritis in the hands. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. Oh! Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. A long time ago, when I was still living in Fiji. And… I think I was in the hospital once when I was a child with a bad fever, but I don’t really remember much about it. That was a very long time ago. That’s all I can think of right now, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal years ago, and a childhood illness. Any family history of hearing loss, dizziness, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! We talked about the hearing loss already, didn’t we? My husband and his mother. But… my uncle, Jone, he had something with his balance, when he was an older man. The doctors said something about his… inner ear? I don’t remember the exact name of it. He had to use a cane for a while. And… my cousin, Sela, she had some trouble with headaches a lot, but I don’t know if that’s related. Does that help? I'm trying my best to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of hearing loss, uncle with balance issues, and cousin with headaches. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Just the one for my blood pressure. Sometimes I take something for my arthritis when my hands are really stiff, but that's just when I need it. It's not every day. And… oh! Lani gave me some vitamins, but I don't take them regularly. I forget! She worries about me getting enough, you see. But just the blood pressure pill consistently, every morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? I trust your judgment. Do I need to do anything special?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just sit comfortably. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll take a look in your ears and check your balance and reflexes. It won’t take long. Take a deep breath for me, please. And another… Good. Heart sounds are regular, within normal limits. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look in your ears… Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen buildup in both ears, but nothing significant obstructing the canal. Tympanic membranes are intact. Now, could you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I’m not very good at balancing, Doctor. I feel a little wobbly already. Is this alright? I don’t want to fall. I can feel myself starting to spin a little…
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that’s enough. Just relax. You’re doing fine. Yes, I see some instability. Now, let’s try a few simple walking steps. Can you walk a few steps forward, and then back?
PATIENT: Oh… this is a bit tricky, Doctor. I feel like I need to look down to keep from falling. It’s not comfortable. I'm trying my best, but I always feel a bit clumsy. Is this what you expected?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is consistent with some balance impairment. Now, just one more quick test. I’m going to gently move your head from side to side, and up and down. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Look at my finger… good. And now to the left… good. And now to the right… Okay. I have enough information for now. You can sit down. We'll discuss the findings shortly. It appears you're experiencing some balance issues, potentially related to a problem with your inner ear. The cerumen buildup could be contributing, and we'll address that.
PATIENT: Oh… inner ear? Is that serious, Doctor? What does that mean? I’m not very good with medical things, you see. Will I need… surgery? I just want to be able to walk without falling, and hear my granddaughter, Lani, clearly again. Is there anything we can do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MayHugh. Let’s not jump to conclusions. “Inner ear problem” is a broad term. It could be a number of things. The slight nystagmus I observed suggests some involvement of the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance. The cerumen buildup is likely exacerbating the issue, so we will start with a cerumen removal procedure to see if that improves your symptoms. Surgery is not likely to be necessary at this stage. We'll start with conservative management. I'm going to order a hearing test, also known as an audiogram, to assess the extent of your hearing loss. I would also like to refer you to an ENT specialist – that’s an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for further evaluation, should your symptoms persist or worsen. They can perform more specialized tests, like a VNG – videonystagmography – to pinpoint the exact cause of your balance issues. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… a hearing test, and see a different doctor… That sounds… complicated. Will the hearing test be uncomfortable? And will the other doctor… poke things in my ears again? I don't like things in my ears. I just want to get rid of this spinning and hear properly. Is there anything else we can do, Doctor? Maybe some medicine? I always hope medicine can fix things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MayHugh, let's take it one step at a time. The hearing test is a simple, painless procedure. You'll wear headphones, and they'll play different tones at varying volumes. You just indicate when you can hear them. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. As for the ENT specialist, they may need to look in your ears, but we can discuss your concerns with them beforehand. They are very good at explaining things and making you feel comfortable. There are some medications that can help with dizziness, but they often have side effects. We want to avoid medication if possible, and address the underlying cause of your symptoms first. Removing the earwax and getting a more definitive diagnosis from the ENT specialist are the best first steps. I'm also going to recommend some vestibular rehabilitation exercises, if the ENT specialist deems it appropriate. These exercises can help retrain your brain to compensate for any balance problems. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Vestibular… what? Oh, goodness. There’s so much. Retrain my brain… I’m an old woman, Doctor. I don't think my brain can be retrained. And I really don't like the sound of anything involving my ears. I just want to be able to walk to the shops with Lani without falling, and hear her voice clearly. Is that too much to ask? Maybe… maybe I should just try to live with it. It's probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Ms. MayHugh, it's not just old age. And it is possible to improve your situation. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises are simple movements that help your brain adapt to any balance issues you're experiencing. It’s not about “retraining” your brain in a complicated way, it's about helping it learn to compensate. And you're not alone in this. Many people experience similar problems, and they've been able to improve their quality of life with treatment. I understand your concerns about your ears, and we can discuss them with the ENT specialist. They can explain the tests and procedures in detail, and address any anxieties you may have. I wouldn't recommend all these tests if I didn't think they could help you. I want you to be able to walk to the shops with Lani without falling, and hear her voice clearly. That's not too much to ask at all. Let's start with the cerumen removal, and then we'll schedule the hearing test. I'll also write a referral to the ENT specialist. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. How does that sound?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes, that sounds better. Cerumen removal… I suppose I can manage that. And the hearing test… alright. But please, Doctor, if the other doctor wants to do anything… complicated… I want you to know. I trust you. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. It's just… scary, you know? Losing your balance, and not knowing what's happening. Let's get the earwax out, then. That sounds like a good first step.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. And you're right to be scared. It’s okay to feel that way. I promise to explain everything clearly, and we'll make informed decisions together. Alright, I'll have the nurse come in and perform the cerumen removal. It's a quick and painless procedure, and it often provides immediate relief. I'll also write the referral to the ENT specialist, and the nurse will give you the paperwork and instructions for scheduling an appointment. We'll take it slowly, one step at a time, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For everything. And please… tell the nurse to be gentle. My ears are very sensitive. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again, Doctor Nestingen. You’ve put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. I’ll make a note to let the nurse know about your sensitive ears. She's very gentle and will take good care of you. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you again after you’ve had the hearing test.
