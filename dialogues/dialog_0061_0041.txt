DOCTOR: "Bula, Mr. Astore! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, bula to you too, Doctor Kimm. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but… little by little. Makes things difficult, it does.
DOCTOR: “Okay, weakness… getting worse gradually. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It started in my legs, I think. Just felt a little… heavy, sometimes. Now, it’s up to my hands a bit, too. Not always, mind you. Some days are better than others. Makes it hard to… well, to do things around the house, things I used to do without thinking. Like gardening. I enjoy my garden very much.
DOCTOR: “I see. So it started in your legs, now affecting your hands, and it’s impacting your ability to do things you enjoy, like gardening. That’s helpful to know. When you say ‘heavy’, can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: It's not painful, Doctor. It’s just… like trying to lift something very, very heavy, even when there's nothing there. Or walking through thick mud, maybe? Slow and… tiring. Not a sharp tiredness, just… a weariness. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: “No, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astore. A heavy, tiring feeling, like walking through mud. Not painful, just…effortful. Okay. And how long ago did you first notice this weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think now. It must be… close to a year, maybe a little more. It was around this time last year, I believe. My wife, Leilani, she noticed it before I did, actually. She’s very observant, that woman. Said I wasn’t moving quite as quickly in the garden. I didn’t pay much attention at first, thought it was just getting old!
DOCTOR: “That’s very astute of Leilani, and it's good she noticed. A year ago… okay. Has it been getting progressively worse the entire year, or have there been periods where it was better or stayed the same?
PATIENT: It's been mostly… steady, I’d say. Some days are definitely worse than others, like you said. But overall, it's been a slow decline. There haven’t been any big jumps, thankfully. Just… a little bit harder each month, it feels like. I used to be able to walk for hours, but now… I have to sit down more often.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a steady decline over the past year, with some fluctuation from day to day. And it’s impacting your walking endurance. Now, besides the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Well, my vision’s been a little blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old too! Leilani says I stumble a bit more than I used to, even when the weakness isn't so bad. And… now that you mention it… I get tired easier, even when I haven’t been doing much. Just… a general weariness, like a weight on me.
DOCTOR: “Okay, blurry vision, some stumbling, and increased fatigue. That’s good information, thank you. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or any difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a question! Well… yes, actually. It’s… a little harder to go sometimes, and I have to… go more often. I hadn’t really thought anything of it, just figured it was part of getting older, like everything else!
DOCTOR: “Okay, changes in bowel habits – difficulty and increased frequency. That’s important to know, thank you for sharing that. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let's see... I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. The doctor put me on some pills, and it's been alright ever since. I haven't had any trouble with it for a long time. Other than that... no, nothing really. I've always been a pretty healthy man, until this started, of course. My wife handles most of the doctor visits, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Okay, history of high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications for that blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a small white pill every morning for the blood pressure. Leilani makes sure I don’t forget. It’s… I think it’s called Amlodipine? Something like that. She handles the refills, so I don't always pay attention to the name. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis in my hands, when it's really bothering me. Just an over-the-counter pain reliever, though.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Amlodipine for blood pressure daily, and occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anything. Leilani always asks when I get a new prescription, just to be safe, but I’ve always been able to take whatever the doctor gives me.
DOCTOR: “Good. And now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had any medical conditions, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological problems like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Hmm... That's a good question. My mother, she had some trouble with her memory when she got older, but the doctor never said it was Alzheimer's, just… old age. My older brother, he had a stroke a few years back, but he smoked heavily his whole life. My father was a strong man, healthy as a horse, lived to be 90. And my children… they're all healthy, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: “Okay, mother with some memory issues, brother with stroke , and father with good health. Now, I'm going to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My father always said it was a waste of money, and a bad habit. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Certainly nothing every day. And I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: “Good to know, Mr. Astore. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And I'll take a look at your feet and hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Astore. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is a bit slow. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and I've noticed some mild weakness in your legs and hands, and a slight tremor in your hands. I also noticed some swelling in your ankles. These findings, along with what you've told me, are concerning for a possible neurological issue, and possibly some peripheral neuropathy. It's important we investigate this further."
PATIENT: Neurological issue? That sounds… serious, Doctor. What does that mean, exactly? And what is… peripheral neuropathy? Is that what's causing all this weakness and trouble with my hands and feet? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: “I understand your worry, Mr. Astore, and it's good you’re asking questions. A ‘neurological issue’ simply means there might be something affecting your nerves or brain. It doesn’t necessarily mean something serious, but it needs to be investigated. Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord – those are the nerves that go to your hands and feet. It could be causing your weakness, numbness, and trouble with your hands and feet, but there are many possible causes. To figure out what’s going on, I’d like to order some tests. I want to do a blood test to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and thyroid. I also want to order an MRI of your brain and spine to look for any abnormalities. And finally, I want to refer you to a neurologist – a specialist who specializes in nerve and brain disorders – for a nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves."
PATIENT: MRI? Nerve conduction study? That sounds… complicated. And a bit frightening, to be honest. What will these tests tell us? And what if something is wrong? Will I need… surgery? Or… medicine? I just want to know what’s going on and how to get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: “I understand your anxiety, Mr. Astore, and it's perfectly normal to feel frightened. Let me explain the tests in a little more detail. An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain and spine. It’s painless, but you’ll need to lie very still inside a large machine. It will help us look for any tumors, inflammation, or other abnormalities. A nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical signals traveling through your nerves. It can tell us if there’s any damage or slowing of nerve function. It might feel a little uncomfortable, like a mild electric shock, but it’s usually not painful. As for what if something is wrong… it’s too early to say. The results of these tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Depending on the cause, treatment options could include medication, physical therapy, or, in rare cases, surgery. However, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, it’s important to get these tests done so we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Lani Kai, a wonderful neurologist here in town. Her office will schedule the nerve conduction study. I will also order the blood tests for you today. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Dr. Lani Kai, you say? I think I’ve heard of her. Good. That’s… reassuring. And the blood tests are alright. I don’t mind those. Will the results take long? And… will someone call me with them? I’m not very good at using computers, so I don’t check email much. My wife handles most of that.
DOCTOR: “That’s excellent that you’ve heard good things about Dr. Kai. She’s very thorough. The blood test results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I will have my nurse, Lehua, call you directly with the results – she knows you prefer a phone call. She will also let you know how to schedule the appointment with Dr. Kai once you’ve had the blood tests. In the meantime, please continue to take your Amlodipine as prescribed. And try to avoid any activities that worsen your symptoms. If you notice any new symptoms, like severe pain, difficulty breathing, or loss of bladder or bowel control, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Astore?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’m still a little worried, of course, but I feel better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. And please thank your nurse, Lehua, for me.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. We’ll take this one step at a time. And I will certainly thank Lehua for you. She’s a wonderful nurse. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Here's a summary of everything we discussed, including the referral and blood test orders. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon."
