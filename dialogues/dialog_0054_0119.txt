DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s… a personal matter. Something a woman doesn't usually discuss so openly. But, I suppose that’s what you’re for, isn’t it? It’s… there’s a… discharge. From my husband, I mean. My late husband. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it's simply dreadful. Honestly, the state of things… it’s quite unhygienic.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to discuss personal matters, Jinnie, and you’ve come to the right place. We’re here to help, and there's absolutely no need to feel embarrassed. It’s good you’re addressing this. To clarify, you mentioned discharge… is this discharge from you, or from something belonging to your late husband, perhaps something he used regularly?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you quite listening? I told you, it’s from my late husband. Though, how it could be from him now is beyond me. It’s… well, it was his electric shaver. The one he used every morning. I’ve been trying to clean it, naturally, but it persists. It's quite… slimy. And it smells. Really quite unpleasant. I thought perhaps a disinfectant would do it, but no luck.
DOCTOR: Ah, I apologize, Jinnie. My mistake – I misheard you initially. You're referring to a discharge from your late husband’s electric shaver. That is an unusual presentation. And you've been attempting to clean it yourself. Okay. To get a better understanding, how long has it been since your husband passed away?
PATIENT: Nearly six months now, Doctor. A sudden illness, you know. Very upsetting. And honestly, it’s one thing to grieve the loss of a husband, quite another to have to deal with… this. It’s been sitting in the bathroom, naturally, since then. I hadn’t gotten around to… properly dealing with his belongings, if you understand. Too painful. But now… now it's become a rather pressing matter, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: I certainly understand, Jinnie. It's perfectly natural to take time to grieve and to put off certain tasks. And it sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. Six months is still relatively recent. So, the shaver has been unused in the bathroom for those six months?
PATIENT: Well, unused is a generous term, Doctor. It’s been sitting there. Collecting dust. And… whatever else. I did try to turn it on once, maybe a month ago, just to see if it still worked. It did, surprisingly. But then I noticed… the residue. And the smell. That's when I realized it wasn’t just dust. It’s… frankly, quite disgusting. I certainly wouldn't use it now, even if I wanted to.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying, Jinnie. And you’re right to be concerned. Given the timeframe and what you've described – a residue and unpleasant odor from an electric shaver that hasn’t been regularly used – it’s unlikely to be a simple cleaning issue. It sounds like there may be microbial growth. While it’s not a typical medical concern for you directly, it does present a potential biohazard. Have you noticed any mold or unusual discoloration on the shaver itself?
PATIENT: Microbial growth? Biohazard? Honestly, Doctor, you’re using such… technical terms. I’m just a simple woman. As for discoloration… yes, I suppose there is some. A sort of greenish tinge, around the blades mostly. And a dark, slimy coating. It’s very difficult to look at, to be honest. I've been trying to avoid it. I just want it gone. Do you think it needs to be… tested? Is that what you’re suggesting? Because frankly, the thought of handling it any more is quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: You’re right to want to avoid handling it, Jinnie. And you don’t need to understand the technical terms. To answer your question: yes, testing is a reasonable step, but given the description – the greenish tinge, the slimy coating, and the length of time it’s been sitting unused – I don't believe a lab test is necessary. It’s highly probable that there’s significant microbial contamination. I would strongly recommend not attempting to clean it further. The safest course of action is to dispose of the shaver as biohazardous waste. Do you have a local waste management service that handles biohazardous materials?
PATIENT: Biohazardous waste?! Doctor, are you telling me my husband’s shaver is… dangerous? Good heavens! No, I have never dealt with biohazardous waste. We live in a very small town. We just… throw things away. Though, I suppose I can't simply throw it in the regular bin, can I? Oh dear. This is all very upsetting. What do I do? Are you suggesting I call the town hall? Will they think I’m completely mad, calling about a contaminated shaver? Honestly, this is a disaster. I just wanted to clean it, not… unleash a public health crisis!
DOCTOR: Please don’t worry, Jinnie. You are not unleashing a public health crisis. It’s a reasonable concern, and you were right to bring it to my attention. And you’re absolutely not mad for calling about this. The risk is very low, but it’s best to be cautious. I’m going to write you a referral to our local environmental health department. They are equipped to handle the safe disposal of potentially contaminated items and can advise you on the best course of action for your town. They will likely arrange for a special collection or provide guidance on appropriate disposal methods. They deal with situations like this all the time, and they won’t think you’re at all mad. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Truly wonderful. I wouldn’t know where to begin, honestly. Environmental Health… yes, that sounds much more… official. And less… alarming. Thank you so much. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I was picturing hazmat suits and emergency protocols. A referral… yes, please. And perhaps a strong cup of tea afterwards? This has been rather… traumatic.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. I'm happy to help alleviate your concerns. I'll get that referral written up for you right away. And a strong cup of tea sounds like a very good idea. While I'm preparing the referral, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Just… getting rid of the shaver, really. It’s a bit silly, isn't it? Worrying about an old shaver. But it’s been hanging over me, this unpleasantness. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. And… discreet. A woman appreciates discretion, you know. Especially when dealing with… these things.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Jinnie. And discretion is always a priority. I'm glad I could help. Here’s the referral to the environmental health department. They're located at [provides address and phone number]. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. And please, take care of yourself. .
