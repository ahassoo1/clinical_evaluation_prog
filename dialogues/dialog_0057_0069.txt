DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguioto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sieh. It's nice to meet you too. I'm here for a vaccination, please. Just a routine one, I think. My Medicare should cover it, I hope?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. A routine vaccination. And just to confirm, that's Nathaiel Paguioto, date of birth…?
PATIENT: November 12th, 1977. Yes, that's right. I remember dates pretty easily, thankfully. It helps with my job, keeping track of everything.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Okay, Mr. Paguioto. And just to be sure, are you up-to-date on your tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Honestly, I'm not sure. It's been a while since I've had one, I think. Maybe... five years ago? Or even longer? I really don't keep track of those things, sorry. Is there a way to check?
DOCTOR: Let me take a look at your records here. Ah, okay. It looks like your last tetanus booster was actually eight years ago, in July of 2017. So, you are due for one. It’s recommended every ten years. Would you like to go ahead and get that done today, along with whatever other routine vaccinations you were thinking of?
PATIENT: Oh, eight years! See? I told you I wasn’t good with dates. Yes, please. If you recommend it, let’s do it. Whatever keeps me healthy, right? What other routine ones should I be thinking about? I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can definitely get that updated for you. Given your age and health history—and assuming no recent travel—the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine are also good options to consider. The pneumococcal vaccine helps protect against pneumonia, especially important as we get older. Have you had either of those this year?
PATIENT: Pneumococcal… that sounds serious. I don’t think I’ve had it this year. No travel, no, just working. And I always get the flu shot, usually around October, but it was a busy season last year, I might have skipped it. Do you have a record of that too, by any chance? I'm terrible at remembering these things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Let's see… ah, here we go. You did get your flu shot in October of last year. So that one is good for now. But it looks like you haven't had the pneumococcal vaccine at all. It's a one-time dose for most people your age, and then boosters as needed. It’s generally recommended. Would you like to go ahead and get it today?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to know about the flu shot! One less thing to worry about. And if it's recommended, yes, let's do the pneumococcal one too. If it helps keep me from getting sick, I'm all for it. I appreciate you looking everything up for me, Doctor. It’s a relief not having to keep track of all of this myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. So, that will be a tetanus booster and the pneumococcal vaccine today. Both are intramuscular injections, so you may have some soreness at the injection site for a day or two. We’ll administer them in your left deltoid. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Left deltoid is good. Soreness is no problem, I can handle a little discomfort. Just glad to get it done and over with, really. Thank you. Do I need to do anything special afterwards? Like, avoid certain activities?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No, nothing major. Just try to use your left arm normally, but avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity with that arm for the rest of the day. You might experience some mild fever or body aches, which is normal, and should resolve within 24-48 hours. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help if needed. Let's get started. I'm going to clean the injection sites now.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds easy enough. No heavy lifting, got it. And I have some acetaminophen at home, just in case. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. Ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, you might feel a little pinch. All done. There you go. Just keep those bandages on for a few hours, and if you experience any unusual symptoms—like a high fever, severe pain, or difficulty breathing—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you so much, Doctor! That wasn't bad at all, really. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just appreciate you taking care of everything for me, and explaining it all so well. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything unusual happens. Is there anything I need to do regarding payment, or does Medicare handle everything directly?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Glad it wasn't too uncomfortable. Let me just verify your insurance information… Okay, it looks like Medicare should cover both vaccinations fully, with no out-of-pocket cost to you. We'll submit the claims directly to Medicare. You should receive an Explanation of Benefits in the mail in a few weeks. Do you have any other concerns at all?
PATIENT: That's wonderful! That's a relief to hear. No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and patience, Doctor Sieh. I really appreciate it. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paguioto. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day too, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. .
