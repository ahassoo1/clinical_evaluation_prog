DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re really bothering me, you see. They’re red and kinda painful. Not all the time, but when I walk a lot, oh boy. It feels like little fires.
DOCTOR: I see. “Little fires,” that’s a very descriptive way to put it, Mr. Aluia. Thank you for sharing that. So, these bumps are primarily on your shins, and the pain is exacerbated by walking. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when you first noticed these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was probably… maybe a couple of months ago? I don't really remember exactly. I just noticed them one day after I’d been doing a lot of work, moving stuff around. I thought maybe I just bumped my legs, but they didn’t go away. And then more started showing up. Does that make sense? I’m not very good with dates, you know. My wife usually remembers things like that.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Aluia. Don’t worry about the dates at all – an approximate timeframe is perfectly helpful. It sounds like they developed gradually after a period of increased activity. Could you describe the bumps themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they're… round-ish, maybe about the size of a small pea? Sometimes a little bigger. And very red. Not like a rash, more like… hard bumps under the skin. They’re not itchy, thankfully. Just… sore. And they feel warm to the touch. My wife says they look kinda angry, is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Angry” is a very good way to describe them, Mr. Aluia. Thank you for that observation. So, they are round, pea-sized, red, hard bumps, not itchy, and warm to the touch. To get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these bumps?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing else. No fever, no swelling anywhere else, no… I haven’t noticed anything different besides the bumps and the pain when I walk a lot. I eat normal, sleep normal… everything’s pretty much the same, except for these things on my legs. It just worries me because I gotta keep working, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Aluia, especially with needing to maintain your work. It's good to hear you haven't experienced any other systemic symptoms like fever or swelling. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see… Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on some pills, and it's been okay since then. I take those every day. Other than that, not much. I had a bad knee when I was younger, but it doesn't bother me too much anymore. And… I think that’s it. Nothing serious, I hope.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Aluia. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a past knee injury. Could you please tell me the name of the medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uhh… that’s a good question. I always just ask my wife to refill it, you know? She handles all that stuff. Let me think… it’s a little white pill… and it has some letters on it… oh, what was it? I think it starts with an "A"... Amlodi… something like that? Amlodipine? Is that right? I'm really sorry, I'm not good with remembering names of things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Aluia. Amlodipine is correct. Thank you for recalling that. It's good to know you are taking Amlodipine for your blood pressure. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, just the Amlodipine. I tried taking some vitamins a while back, but I forgot to take them every day, so I stopped. My wife says I’m too forgetful. Honestly, I don't really like taking a lot of pills. Just the blood pressure one is enough for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Just the Amlodipine is fine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any bad reactions to anything. I eat everything… well, almost everything. My wife always makes sure I don't eat anything I shouldn't. She’s very careful about that. I think if I was allergic to something, she would definitely know!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know, Mr. Aluia. No known allergies. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a kid, I had my tonsils taken out, but that was a long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a couple of days when I broke my arm playing basketball. But that was also when I was young. Other than that, no. Nothing serious. I've been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, tonsillectomy and a broken arm in your youth, but no recent hospitalizations or major surgeries. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Family history... That's a tough one. My mother had… well, she had some problems with her heart when she got older. And my father… he had diabetes. But other than that, I don’t really know much about it. My family doesn’t really talk about those things much, you know? We mostly just talk about food and the grandkids.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Aluia. That's perfectly alright. So, a history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never touched any of those things. My wife would kill me if I did! I don’t like the taste of cigarettes, and alcohol just makes me sleepy. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I just like to work and spend time with my family.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Mr. Aluia. No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Now, if you don’t mind, I would like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll need to take your blood pressure and pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine the bumps on your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to get these bumps figured out, you know? They’re really bothering me when I work. Go ahead, take your time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, and your pulse is 78 beats per minute. That’s slightly elevated, but not critically high, considering your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s examine the bumps on your legs. They are firm, red, and slightly warm to the touch, as you described. There is some tenderness to palpation, but no signs of infection – no pus or drainage. They are primarily located on the anterior shins bilaterally. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just the pain when I walk a lot. And they get kinda itchy sometimes, but not all the time. It's a weird feeling. Like… little fire ants crawling under my skin, maybe? It’s hard to explain, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Aluia. "Little fire ants" is a very descriptive way to put it. Intermittent itching along with the pain and tenderness is helpful information. Based on your history and the physical exam, the bumps on your shins could be shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, potentially complicated by mild inflammation. However, other possibilities need to be considered. To help narrow down the diagnosis, I’d like to order some basic blood work to check for inflammation markers and rule out other conditions. I also recommend an X-ray of both legs to rule out a stress fracture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray… alright, whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing this and get it fixed. My wife is always worried about me, you know? She says I push myself too hard at work. So, yes, let’s do the tests. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my nurse draw some blood for the lab work. We can do the X-ray here in the clinic as well. It’s a quick and painless procedure. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible. Avoid strenuous activity, and consider applying ice packs to the affected areas for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage the pain and inflammation. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Rest, ice, and those pills… okay, I can do that. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. My wife will be so relieved. Thank you for taking the time to look at me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I understand your concern, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We’ll contact you as soon as the lab results and X-ray results are available, typically within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, swelling, or severe pain. Have a good day, Mr. Aluia. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. I definitely will.
