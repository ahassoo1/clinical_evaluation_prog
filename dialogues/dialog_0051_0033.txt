DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, I haven’t the time for this. But my… assistant insisted. It’s my vision, and my hearing. Both seem to be… fading. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I need to be able to see my patients, and hear what their mothers are saying. It’s all very disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. It sounds frustrating to have changes in your vision and hearing affecting your work. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t possibly say. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s all a blur, you see. I have a very busy schedule. Important things to attend to. I don't typically focus on such… trivial matters. Is there a quick test we can do? Because I have a surgery scheduled for this afternoon. A rather delicate one, actually.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can do some quick tests. Just to clarify, when you say a few weeks, has it been a gradual change, or did it seem to come on more suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly, I believe. Though, as I said, I don't pay much attention to these things. One morning, I simply… noticed it was harder to see. And the sounds… muffled. It’s all rather unpleasant. Really, I expect this sort of thing is common at my age. My mother… well, she wasn’t very robust either. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. We’ll start with a quick check of your vision. Could you please follow my penlight with your eyes?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? A penlight? Is that all? Very well. But do hurry. I have important phone calls to return.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie, just focus straight ahead. I'm going to hold up a couple of fingers on either side, and I want you to tell me how many fingers you see when I hold them up. And please let me know if you see any dark spots or blurry areas in your peripheral vision. First, let's start with your right eye.
PATIENT: Two, I suppose. Though, honestly, it’s all rather… indistinct. Is this necessary? I’ve never had trouble seeing my patients before. They’re usually quite clear. Perhaps it’s the lighting in here. It’s awfully dim. And frankly, I find your fingers distracting. They’re rather… stubby.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Let's try the left eye now. Same thing – just tell me how many fingers you see.
PATIENT: One. No, perhaps none. It’s all very hazy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite unwell. This is a complete waste of my time. Is there anything concrete you can tell me? Or are we simply going to play guessing games with your… appendages? I have a waiting room full of people, you know. Important people.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you coming in today. However, based on this quick exam, I'm concerned about a possible visual field deficit. This could indicate a serious neurological issue that needs to be investigated immediately. Given your upcoming surgery, it’s even more critical. I strongly recommend we postpone the surgery and get a CT scan of your brain right away. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist as soon as possible. Are you able to arrange for this?
PATIENT: Postpone my surgery?! Are you mad?! Absolutely not! That surgery is crucial. Years of planning have gone into it. I have a reputation to uphold! A CT scan? A neurologist? This is preposterous. I’ve never needed any of those… fancy tests before. I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly fine. It’s probably just stress. Yes, that’s it. Too much responsibility. I think I’ll get a second opinion. From someone… more experienced. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a surgery to prepare for. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your concerns, but I must strongly advise against proceeding with the surgery without further investigation. I'm worried about the potential risks, and proceeding without a proper diagnosis could have serious consequences. I'm documenting my concerns in your chart, and I'm happy to provide you with a written referral to a neurologist and a list of imaging centers. I am also going to strongly recommend that you do not drive yourself home. I want you to understand that I am acting in your best interest. .
