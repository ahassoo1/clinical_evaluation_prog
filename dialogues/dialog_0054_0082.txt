DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... good morning. Yeah, hi. Something about...travel? My wife, she... she booked it. I don't really know all the details. She always did the planning.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like this might be related to a trip your wife arranged. No worries at all if you aren’t sure of the specifics. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any symptoms currently, or is this a check-up related to preparing for travel?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, no symptoms. I feel...okay. Normal, I guess. Just... going on a trip. She wanted me to get some...shots? Pills? Something like that, before we go.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like your wife scheduled a travel consultation for you to discuss vaccinations and medications you might need before your trip. That’s very proactive of her. Do you know where you’ll be traveling to?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. She said something about... mountains? And... lots of people. Somewhere far away. Nepal, maybe? Is that right? I think it was Nepal. She really liked Nepal.
DOCTOR: Yes, Nepal! That’s right. Okay, Nepal is a beautiful country. We'll definitely want to review some recommended and required vaccinations and discuss any potential health precautions for traveling there. Before we get into specifics, can you tell me a little bit about the trip itself?
PATIENT: Uh... she booked a tour. A hiking tour. Lots of walking, she said. Up high. We were supposed to leave... soon. Very soon. I don’t know the exact date. She handled all of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hiking tour at a high altitude. That’s good to know. Altitude sickness is something we’ll definitely want to discuss. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, like heart problems, lung issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Huh? No. Nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy. Always been… okay. A little tired sometimes, but that’s it. She always said I worked too hard.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No... nothing. Except maybe… sometimes I take something for my back. It aches when I work. But it's just… a little cream. You rub it on. Nothing you swallow.
DOCTOR: Okay, a topical cream for your back. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or insect bites?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don't think so. I get bitten by mosquitoes all the time, but I don’t swell up or anything. Maybe a little itchy. She always put some cream on those bites, too. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything… important.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital...? No. Never been in the hospital. Not even as a kid. She always took care of me when I was sick. Just… colds, mostly. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. And have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries...? No. Never had surgery. Not me. She… she always said I was too tough to need surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, is there any family history of significant medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm... family? My parents… they both… passed away a long time ago. When I was young. I don't really remember much about their health. She… she didn't talk about it much. Just that they weren’t very strong.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. That's alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh... okay. Scale. Right.
DOCTOR: Okay, you weigh 104 pounds and your height is 155 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… That's a bit on the lower end, but within a reasonable range. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright… yeah, okay. Sounds… fine. Just… get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 118/72, which is excellent. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say "Ahhh."
PATIENT: Ahhhh…
DOCTOR: Everything looks good. Your throat is clear, and your ears are also clear. Okay, so everything seems physically normal. Given your travel plans to Nepal for a hiking tour at high altitude, we need to discuss vaccinations and altitude sickness prevention. Do you have any idea what vaccinations you might need?
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? No. She told me… something about typhoid and… hepatitis? Maybe. I don’t remember the names. She just said I needed some shots before we left.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on current recommendations for Nepal, you'll want to be up to date on routine vaccinations like measles-mumps-rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, and influenza. In addition to those, typhoid and hepatitis A vaccinations are highly recommended. Hepatitis B is also advisable, especially if there's a chance of medical procedures or close contact with others. We should also discuss Japanese encephalitis, depending on the specific areas you'll be visiting and the time of year. Do you have any records of your previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Uh... no. No records. She always kept those. She had a whole… folder with everything. But… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. In that case, we may need to start some vaccinations today. We can also discuss a booster schedule to ensure you're fully protected. Before we proceed with vaccinations, I want to make sure you're aware of the potential side effects. Common side effects include soreness at the injection site, mild fever, and fatigue. More serious side effects are rare, but we'll monitor you closely. Do you have any concerns or questions about vaccinations at this point?
PATIENT: Soreness…? Fever…? Sounds… unpleasant. She always said I didn’t handle pain very well. What if… what if I get sick from the shots?
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Odell. It's true that there is a small risk of side effects, but serious reactions are very rare. The benefits of protecting yourself from potentially serious diseases in Nepal far outweigh the risk of side effects from the vaccinations. We can start with the typhoid and hepatitis A vaccinations today, as those are most important for food and waterborne illnesses. We can space out the other vaccinations over the next few weeks to minimize any potential discomfort. Before we start, I want to review some altitude sickness prevention strategies with you as well. This is particularly important given your plans for a hiking tour. Are you familiar with altitude sickness?
PATIENT: Altitude…? She said something about… going up slowly? And… drinking lots of water? I don’t really know. I’ve never been to the mountains before. She always… took care of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We’ll go through it together. Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness, happens when you ascend to high altitudes too quickly. Symptoms can include headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, it can be life-threatening. The key to prevention is gradual ascent. Ascend slowly, allowing your body time to acclimatize. Avoid strenuous activity for the first few days at high altitude. And, as you mentioned, drink plenty of fluids. We can also discuss a medication called acetazolamide, which can help prevent altitude sickness. It has some side effects, so we’ll weigh the risks and benefits together. Before we talk about medications, let’s focus on the vaccinations first. Are you comfortable proceeding with the typhoid and hepatitis A vaccinations today?
PATIENT: ... Okay. Typhoid and… hepatitis. If it helps. Just… get it over with quickly, please. I don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll prepare the vaccinations. It’s a quick injection in your upper arm. You might feel a slight pinch, and there might be some soreness afterward, but it shouldn’t last long. I'm going to clean the area with an alcohol swab, then administer the injection. Try to relax your arm. Here we go… Okay, all done. There you go. You might experience some mild soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site over the next few days. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if needed. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss any further vaccinations and address any concerns you may have. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No... I think that's all. Just… tired. And… worried.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Odell. It's a lot to take in. Here's a handout with information about the vaccinations we discussed today, as well as some tips for altitude sickness prevention. It also includes my contact information, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’m also going to write you a note for work, excusing you from strenuous activity for a few days, given the vaccinations and the potential for mild side effects. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No... I think that's everything. Thank you… Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Odell. Remember, I'm here to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a safe trip, and please take care of yourself.
