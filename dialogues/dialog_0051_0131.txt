DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Glazewski, nice to meet you too. Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I really should get it checked out. She worries, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, sisters often do worry – a good thing, usually. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to take seriously. Okay. And when you say "lately," about how long has it been elevated, and do you happen to know what the readings were, or roughly what they were, when you checked it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's been... maybe three or four months now, I'd say. I don't have exact numbers, no. I borrowed my neighbor's machine a few times, and it was always a bit above what I thought was normal. Like, over 140 something, maybe? I'm not really good with remembering numbers, honestly. It just felt high when I compared it to what the nurse said when I got my flu shot last year.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, and readings over 140… that's good information, even without the exact number. It’s helpful that you recall a comparison to the nurse’s reading. We’ll definitely want to get a more accurate reading today, of course. Do you experience any symptoms along with the high blood pressure—like headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Not really. No headaches or dizziness, no. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but honestly, who doesn't feel tired these days? I wouldn't say it's anything to do with my blood pressure, though. It's just… life, you know? I'm a home health aide, so I'm on my feet a lot. Could just be that.
DOCTOR: Yes, being on your feet all day as a home health aide would certainly contribute to fatigue. Okay, no headaches, no dizziness… just the tiredness. And have you noticed any changes in your breathing, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No changes to my breathing, not that I've noticed. And my ankles aren't swollen, no. I do get a little bit of water retention sometimes, especially in the evenings, but that's been happening for years. My momma always said it was just my body holding onto things.
DOCTOR: Mothers often have good instincts, don't they?
PATIENT: They really do! So, what happens next? Are you gonna take my blood pressure now?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's get a reading to start. We'll check it on both arms, and I’ll also want to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick physical exam. It will just be routine things, nothing to worry about. After that, depending on the results, we can discuss potential causes and a plan of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92 on your right arm, and 152 over 94 on your left. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope, if that's okay. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Everything sounds good so far, but the blood pressure readings are elevated. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Okay, those numbers don't sound good, do they? No, I haven't been diagnosed with anything before. Just the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox. I've been pretty healthy, honestly. My sister always said I had good genes, but maybe those genes are letting me down now! No high cholesterol or diabetes or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you've been healthy overall. And genes can be tricky! We’ll figure this out. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And I haven’t been in the hospital since I was born. My momma always took good care of me when I was sick, she had all sorts of home remedies. Oh, wait! I did have my tonsils out when I was little. That was… a long time ago. Maybe 20 years or more? It wasn't a big deal, I recovered fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy many years ago. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I’ll just drink some chamomile tea if I’m not feeling well. My sister keeps telling me I should take a multivitamin, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything! My momma used to say I had a cast iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my momma lived to be 85, and she was pretty healthy for most of her life. My daddy passed away when I was young, he had a heart attack. And my sister, she’s fine, but she has high cholesterol. That’s about it, really. Nothing major on either side that I know of. Oh! My grandmother on my daddy’s side, she had high blood pressure too, I think. But she lived a long life, even with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your grandmother and high cholesterol in your sister. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. I can't stand the smell of it. And I don't drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine at Christmas.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol. How about exercise?
PATIENT: Well, it's hard to get a lot of exercise with my job, you know? I'm on my feet all day, walking around with patients, but it's not like going to the gym. I try to take the stairs when I can, and I walk around the block sometimes in the evenings. I used to dance a lot more when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Being on your feet all day as a home health aide definitely counts for something. Okay, and finally, can you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, chicken and fish. I love to cook, so I usually make my own meals. I do have a sweet tooth, though. I can't resist a good piece of rum cake! And I do eat a little salt, but not too much, I think. I try to avoid processed foods as much as possible. It's hard sometimes when you're busy, though. Sometimes I just grab something quick and easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mostly healthy diet with a sweet tooth and occasional quick meals. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mykeisha. That gives me a much better picture of your overall health. Given your blood pressure readings, your family history, and your lifestyle, I think it's important to investigate this further. The elevated readings warrant some additional testing to determine the cause and rule out any underlying issues. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We should also do a urine analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get things back to normal. Blood work and a urine test… okay. Do I need to fast before the blood work? I really like breakfast!
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight to twelve hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. And I understand about breakfast, it's the most important meal of the day! We can schedule the tests for first thing in the morning if that works best for you. After we get the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan of action. Depending on the results, that might involve lifestyle changes, medication, or further testing. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels and get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Also, keeping a food diary for a week or so might be helpful to identify any potential triggers. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable. Fasting, blood work, food diary… okay, I can do that. And I’ll try to get more exercise, even if it’s just walking around the block. Stress is hard, though! My job can be stressful sometimes. But I'll try my best. So, what about the results? How long will it take to get them back? I hope it’s not too long.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress is certainly a factor for many people. We can discuss some stress-reduction techniques at your follow-up appointment if you'd like. The lab results typically take about three to five business days to come back. Once they’re available, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We’ll review everything together and come up with a personalized plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any severe symptoms—like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds good. Three to five days for the results… I can wait. And I’ll remember about the severe symptoms. Thank you, Dr. Glazewski. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re a team in this. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll have the lab order sent to the lab electronically, and the nurse will give you some instructions before you leave. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Okay, great. Thank you again. I will. Have a good day, doctor.
DOCTOR: You too, Mykeisha. Take care.
