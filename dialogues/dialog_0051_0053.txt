DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been having trouble going to the bathroom. You know, peeing. It just… takes me a long time to start, and sometimes it feels like I can't go all the way.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not embarrassing at all, Ms. Yadao. These things happen, and it’s good you’re addressing it. Many people experience urinary difficulties at some point. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. When did you first start noticing this problem?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three or four months ago? It was gradual, not sudden. At first, it was just a little bit slower than usual, and I didn’t really pay much attention. But then it got worse over the weeks, and now it’s… well, now it’s enough that it worries me. I had to wait a little longer at Mrs. Olsen’s house yesterday, and it was difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset over three to four months. And it’s become noticeable enough to affect your daily activities, like your visit with Mrs. Olsen. That gives us some good information. Can you describe what it feels like before you start urinating?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like… I feel the urge to go, of course. But then… nothing happens right away. I have to… push a little, almost like I'm straining. And it takes a few moments before the stream actually starts. It’s not painful, exactly, just… frustrating and a bit uncomfortable. Sometimes I feel like I have to go more often than usual too, but when I do try, it’s still difficult to get it going. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Yadao. You're describing hesitancy – difficulty starting the urine stream – and straining to urinate. The increased frequency is also important to note. Now, once you are able to urinate, is the stream strong and steady, or is it weak or interrupted?
PATIENT: It’s… not very strong, Doctor. It’s more like a trickle at first, and it comes and goes a bit. It’s not a solid, continuous stream like it used to be. I have to… try to keep it going. And sometimes, after I think I’m finished, a little bit comes out a few moments later, just dribbles. It's very annoying. I worry about making a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have hesitancy, a weak stream, intermittency, and post-void dribbling. That's quite a bit of information, thank you for being so thorough. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, I was diagnosed about ten years ago. I take a pill for it every morning. And… oh, I had a bladder infection maybe five years ago, but it cleared up quickly with antibiotics. Otherwise, not much. I've been pretty healthy for my age, I think. My mother had arthritis, but I haven't had any trouble with that, thankfully. Do you need a list of the medicines I take? I have it right here in my purse.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Yadao. High blood pressure and a previous bladder infection are good to know. And yes, if you could please get that list of medications for me, that would be great. Knowing exactly what you’re taking is important. While you’re getting that, I’d like to ask a few other questions. Have you noticed any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. That's why I didn't think it was another infection. It's just… difficult, and weak. Not painful at all. Here’s the list. It's just the one for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, and I take 20 milligrams every morning. Oh, and sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little bit of Melatonin, but that’s not every night. It’s just as needed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. Lisinopril and occasional Melatonin. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright with you. I'll need to check your abdomen and do a brief neurological exam, and then I'd like to do a quick check of your prostate, if you don't mind. This will help me assess your condition further. It's a standard part of evaluating urinary issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a prostate check? But… I'm a woman, Doctor. I thought only men had prostates. Are you sure? I mean, I’m happy to cooperate, but… that sounds wrong. Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding?
DOCTOR: Oh dear! You are absolutely right, Ms. Yadao. My sincerest apologies! That was a terrible mistake on my part – a lapse in concentration. Women do not have a prostate. Please forgive me. I was thinking ahead to possible causes, and unfortunately, my brain went to the wrong place. We will not be doing a prostate exam. Instead, I’d like to do a neurological exam, which will help me check your reflexes and sensation, and then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to feel for any abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s alright, Doctor. Mistakes happen. You’re very busy, I understand. A neurological exam and checking my abdomen sounds perfectly fine. Don’t worry about it. It just… startled me a little! You know, a woman and a prostate… it’s a bit much to take in on a Tuesday morning. Let's get on with it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your kindness, Ms. Yadao. I truly appreciate it. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to start with listening to your abdomen, and then we’ll proceed with the neurological exam. It may take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Take your time. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I don't want to make a fuss, but I'd like to be aware of what's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds relatively normal here. I'm feeling your abdomen now – just let me know if anything is tender or uncomfortable. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… okay, Doctor. A little bit of pressure, of course, but nothing painful. It’s a bit tender just above my bladder, maybe? It’s hard to say. It’s always a little sensitive there, but it feels a bit more… prominent today, perhaps. It’s not a sharp pain, just… awareness. Like someone is pressing on it. It’s not too bad, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness above the bladder. That’s helpful information. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs and feet. Could you bend your knees and keep your legs relaxed?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. Just let me know if anything feels strange. I sometimes get a little bit of tingling in my feet, but it's nothing serious. Just an old age thing, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but that's not necessarily cause for alarm, especially given your age. The sensation in your feet is a little bit reduced as well, but again, that's not unexpected. Now, let’s discuss your symptoms and what we’ve found so far. You've been experiencing hesitancy, a weak stream, intermittency, and post-void dribbling. The abdominal exam revealed some tenderness above your bladder, and the neurological exam showed slightly diminished reflexes and sensation. Based on this, it's possible you have an issue with the nerves controlling your bladder, or there could be some inflammation or obstruction causing these symptoms. It could also be related to a weakened bladder muscle. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Tests are always a good idea. Better to know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. What kind of tests are you thinking of? Will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge game next Tuesday, and I’d like to know if I’ll be able to concentrate.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good attitude, Ms. Yadao. Knowing what’s going on is always best. I’m thinking of a urinalysis to check for any infection or abnormalities in your urine, and a post-void residual volume test, which will tell us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. That one is non-invasive – it just involves a simple scan. We might also want to consider a bladder ultrasound to get a better look at the structure of your bladder. And, depending on the results of those tests, we might consider a urodynamic study to assess how well your bladder and urethra are functioning. The urinalysis and ultrasound are painless. The post-void residual volume test is also painless. The urodynamic study can be a little bit uncomfortable, but it's usually well-tolerated. The results of the urinalysis and ultrasound should be available within a few days. The post-void residual volume test results should be available within a day or two. The urodynamic study results may take a week or so. I’ll be sure to let you know as soon as I have them. Hopefully, it won’t interfere with your bridge game! We can discuss the results and a plan of action at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. A few tests, a follow-up appointment… it’s all very organized. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And good to hear about the bridge game! It’s the highlight of my week, you know. So, shall we get the tests scheduled? And do I need to do anything to prepare for them? I have a bit of a leaky bladder sometimes, so should I limit my fluids beforehand?
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Yadao. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed. And I completely understand about the bridge game – we all have things we look forward to. Yes, let’s get the tests scheduled. The nurse will come in shortly to draw some blood for the urinalysis and schedule the ultrasound. We’ll likely schedule the post-void residual volume test for sometime next week, and if needed, the urodynamic study after that. As for preparation, for the urinalysis, just drink a normal amount of fluids beforehand – no need to limit anything. For the ultrasound, you don’t need to do anything special. And for the post-void residual volume test, we’ll ask you to drink a certain amount of fluid before the test, so you don’t need to worry about limiting fluids beforehand either. I’ll also give you a referral to a urologist if the tests reveal anything concerning, or if your symptoms don’t improve. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what the next steps are. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I’ll wait for the nurse then. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be right in. Have a good day, Ms. Yadao. .
