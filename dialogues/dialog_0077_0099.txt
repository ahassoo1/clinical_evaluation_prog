DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding the results of an examination… a test of my stomach, I believe? They mentioned it wasn’t quite normal, and I wanted to understand what that means. It was an… an endoscopic test, was it? I apologize, my memory isn’t quite what it used to be with these things, but I do recall it being… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Minatra, I see here you had an endoscopy on July 12th. It’s quite alright about the memory – many patients find the procedure unsettling and it can blur things. We’ll go over everything together. Just to clarify, and for my records, are you experiencing any current discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, that was the date, thank you. And you are very kind to understand, Doctor. As for discomfort… not constantly, no. But I have been feeling… a bit off, I suppose. A sort of dull ache in my stomach, mostly after I eat. And sometimes… well, sometimes I feel rather full, even if I haven’t eaten much. It's not debilitating, but it is concerning. It’s just… different than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache after eating, and feeling full quickly… that's helpful. Can you describe the ache a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t a sharp pain, not like a cramp. It’s more… a heavy feeling, a pressure, right in the center of my abdomen. It doesn’t radiate anywhere, thankfully. And it usually fades after an hour or so, though sometimes it lingers if I've eaten something… rich, perhaps. I find simpler foods are better tolerated. Though even then, it sometimes happens. I do hope that clarifies things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very descriptive, thank you. And when you say "rich" foods, could you give me a few examples of what you mean?
PATIENT: Of course. When I say rich, I generally mean anything with a lot of fat. Fried foods, for example, definitely bring it on. Creamy sauces, things like that. Also, spicy foods can sometimes trigger it, though not as reliably. And… oh, large portions of red meat as well. I have noticed those tend to upset my stomach more than, say, fish or chicken. I try to eat a balanced diet, but… I do enjoy my cooking, and sometimes I indulge.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I have been rather tired lately, but I attributed that to my age, to be honest. It’s hard to say if it’s connected. And… sometimes I feel a little… bloated, after eating. Not terribly so, but noticeably. Oh! And… a change in my bowel movements, perhaps? I apologize, it’s not a pleasant topic, but I have been… less regular than usual. More… infrequent, and… a little harder to pass, at times. It's not severe, but it is a change.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, bloating, and a change in bowel habits… Thank you for sharing all of that, Ms. Minatra. It’s all important information. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I haven’t had any major illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. As an adult… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that was a fairly straightforward procedure, and I recovered well. I’ve had the typical age-related things, high blood pressure, which I manage with medication. And… arthritis in my knees, which… well, that’s just part of getting older, I suppose. No surgeries besides the gallbladder. I haven't been hospitalized in… well, decades. And I don’t take any other regular medication besides the blood pressure pills. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal twenty years ago, high blood pressure managed with medication… and arthritis. That’s helpful. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… it's Lisinopril, I believe. 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, at least ten years now, perhaps longer. My husband used to manage the refills, so I'm not entirely certain of the specifics. But the pharmacist is very good, and she always reminds me. It keeps things under control, thankfully. I try to limit my salt intake as well, to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20 milligrams. Good. Now, Ms. Minatra, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you have any family members with a history of stomach problems, like ulcers, or stomach cancer?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My husband’s family, I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. We didn’t stay in close contact. My mother… she had some digestive issues, yes. A lot of bloating and discomfort, but it was never properly diagnosed. The doctors said it was just “nervous stomach,” which… I always felt was a bit dismissive. And my brother… he was diagnosed with colon cancer about five years ago, but he didn't discuss the specifics with me. He… he passed away last year. It’s a rather sensitive topic, I apologize. I wish I had more information to share, but that’s all I can recall.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Minatra. That’s perfectly alright, and I’m very sorry to hear about your brother. It's difficult when family history is uncertain, or shrouded in sadness. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I have never smoked. My husband… he tried it once, many years ago, but he didn’t enjoy it and quit immediately. We both believed it was a very unhealthy habit, and we always avoided it. I do get irritated by the smell, to be honest. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, despite my age and… these little ailments. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's about it. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And how often do you consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often at all, Doctor. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week, if that. Sometimes less. It’s more of a social thing, when friends come over. I don’t drink alone, and I certainly don’t drink to excess. It's just… a little relaxation. I'm careful with my health, I assure you. I don't want to make this more complicated than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Minatra, thank you for being so open and forthcoming. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll just listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand it’s necessary. Please proceed. I'll just… remove my jacket, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Please feel free to disrobe to your comfort level and lie down on the examination table. I'll be just outside if you need anything. I will begin with listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Okay, Ms. Minatra, if you could lie flat for me. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Okay… bowel sounds are present, though a little… sluggish. No bruits detected. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little… pressure, perhaps, but no sharp pain. It's just… uncomfortable, like a dull ache. It’s the same feeling I described earlier, just… more pronounced. Please, do be gentle. This is… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course. I apologize. I will be very gentle. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Right… around here. It's not excruciating, but it's definitely more tender than the rest. It feels… almost bruised, if that makes sense. Please, don't press too hard. It's… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in the upper center of your abdomen. Any discomfort on your sides, around your back?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little… achey, perhaps, like muscle soreness, but nothing significant. I do have arthritis, you know. It sometimes radiates. It's hard to say what’s just the arthritis and what isn't. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Ms. Minatra, based on what you've told me and the examination, I’m concerned about the tenderness in your upper abdomen and your symptoms of early fullness and dull ache. The sluggish bowel sounds are also a bit concerning. Given your history of an endoscopic test that showed an abnormality, and the possibility of underlying digestive issues, I'm going to recommend further investigation. Specifically, I would like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test to check for any signs of infection or bleeding. Additionally, I think it would be prudent to repeat the endoscopy, to get a more definitive understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help determine what’s causing these symptoms, then I am happy to comply. Repeat endoscopy… that doesn’t sound pleasant, but if it’s necessary… I suppose I must. The blood tests and stool sample… those are less concerning, I suppose. Will these tests be… expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see, and I am on a fixed income. I worry about the financial burden.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Minatra. And I understand your situation. The cost of these tests can be significant. Let me see what I can do to help. There are some programs that offer financial assistance for patients without insurance, and I’ll see if you qualify for any of those. Additionally, I can sometimes work with the lab to negotiate a lower rate. I can also discuss with you the possibility of prioritizing the tests—we may be able to start with the blood tests and stool sample, which are less expensive, and then proceed with the endoscopy if the results warrant it. I don’t want the cost to be a barrier to your care. Let’s work together to find a solution. For now, let me write the orders for the blood tests and stool sample. They're fairly straightforward. You can go to the lab across the street, and they'll collect the samples. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That… that is very kind of you, Doctor. Truly. I appreciate you taking the time to consider my financial situation. Yes, that would be wonderful, starting with the less expensive tests. The lab across the street… yes, I’ve been there before, for routine bloodwork. I believe they require a form from the doctor, correct? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for the stool sample? I apologize, these are not elegant questions, but I want to be properly prepared.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're correct. I'll fax the orders to the lab right now. They will need a valid photo ID, and a list of any medications you are currently taking. As for the stool sample, there are a few instructions to follow to ensure the accuracy of the results. They will provide you with a collection kit, and a set of instructions. Generally, you'll need to collect a small sample of stool in a clean, dry container, and avoid any antibiotics or laxatives for a few days prior to the collection. The lab will give you very specific directions, and I can also provide you with a written handout. Here's the handout now. Please read through these instructions carefully. And don't hesitate to call the lab if you have any questions. They're very helpful. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… very helpful. The handout is much appreciated. No, I believe that answers all my questions for now. I suppose I will go to the lab and arrange the tests. And then… wait for the results. It’s… unsettling, not knowing. But I am grateful for your attention and your kindness, Doctor Pirl. I truly am. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Any specific symptoms to watch for, while I wait for the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. While you’re waiting for the results, please monitor your symptoms for any worsening. Specifically, I’d like you to watch for: Severe abdominal pain Bloody stools Persistent nausea or vomiting Unexplained weight loss Fever If you experience any of these symptoms, please contact me immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Otherwise, just try to maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get plenty of rest. Here's my card with the clinic's contact information. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll follow up with you as soon as the results are available. And please remember, we'll work through this together. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Pirl, I don't think so. You have been very thorough, and I feel much more… at ease, knowing I have a plan. I appreciate your kindness and your attention, truly. I will go to the lab and arrange the tests, as you suggested. And I will contact you if anything changes, or if I experience any of those symptoms you mentioned. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Minatra. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
