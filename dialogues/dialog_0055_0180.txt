DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It’s…it’s this tiredness. Just so tired all the time. And…and I’ve been eating dirt. Not like on purpose, exactly. Just…craving it. It’s embarrassing, okay? I just want to know what’s wrong with me so I can get out of here.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we'll certainly try to ascertain what’s going on. Craving non-food items is…unusual, to say the least. To begin, can you describe this tiredness for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It's…heavy. Like someone put weights on my eyelids. I sleep, but it doesn’t help. And it's not just when I'm tired, it's all the time. Even after a full night. I just…don’t have the energy for anything anymore. I used to be able to…well, nevermind. It doesn't matter now. Things change, right?
DOCTOR: Indeed they do. When did you first notice this fatigue starting, Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. When? A while ago. Months, maybe? It started slowly, I guess. Just a little bit more tired each day. Hard to say. I don't really keep track of things like that. It just…got worse and worse until I couldn't ignore it anymore. Does that make sense? Honestly, I don't remember a specific date. Why does it even matter, really?
DOCTOR: It matters, Ms. Cantoran, because it helps us determine the potential causes. While a precise date isn’t crucial, even a general timeframe – was this before or after a particular event, perhaps?
PATIENT: Event? Let me think… My husband, he…passed away about a year ago. Maybe it started after that. Everything’s a blur, if I’m being honest. I was busy with…things. Funeral stuff. Paperwork. It was awful. Does that count as an event? I just wanted to be left alone, honestly. I didn't even notice how tired I was until… well, now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can manifest in many ways, and exhaustion is a common symptom. However, given the duration you’ve described, and the addition of the… unusual cravings, we should investigate further. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and craving for dirt, Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible ones, just…dull aches. And I’ve been feeling…cold. All the time. Even when it's warm out. And I guess…my stomach hasn't been right. Sort of…upset. But that could be anything, right? I don't eat like I used to. Everything tastes…wrong, somehow. I don't know. It's just a lot of little things. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cantoran, we won’t keep you unnecessarily. But these “little things”, as you call them, are important pieces of the puzzle. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Firstly, regarding your diet – has it changed significantly, apart from the altered taste?
PATIENT: Changed? I eat less. A lot less. I just…don't have much appetite. Used to love cooking, but now it feels like too much effort. I mostly eat…whatever’s easiest. Canned soup, toast… things like that. I don’t really bother with fresh vegetables or meat anymore. Not like I need to, right? It's just…easier. And honestly, less upsetting when I don't feel like eating. Don't see the point.
DOCTOR: I see. And regarding the craving for dirt, Ms. Cantoran, can you describe where you are obtaining it from?
PATIENT: Ugh, why do you need to know where? It's just…dirt! From the garden. Behind the house. I just…dig a little bit up. Don't judge me, okay? I don't eat a lot of it. Just a little bit here and there when the craving hits. It's…hard to explain. It just feels…right. Does that even make sense? It's not like I'm eating rocks or something! It's dirt! I can't believe I have to explain this to you.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Cantoran, I am not here to judge. I am simply attempting to gather information to determine the cause of your symptoms. The source of the dirt is relevant. Now, have you noticed any other unusual cravings, besides for dirt?
PATIENT: No! Just the dirt. I swear. Don't ask me about rocks, or paper, or… I don't know, whatever else people crave. It's just the dirt. I'm not…some crazy person. I just want to feel better, okay? This is embarrassing enough as it is. Can we please just get this over with? I feel like I'm being interrogated. What is it? What's wrong with me? Just tell me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I am simply trying to determine the underlying cause of your fatigue and unusual cravings. To that end, I would like to perform a physical examination, if you are willing. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. It is standard procedure, and it may provide valuable clues as to what is going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I don't see the point, but… just do it. I have things to do, you know. Don't take all day. And please be gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be. And try not to poke too much. I don't like being poked. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please extend your arm?
