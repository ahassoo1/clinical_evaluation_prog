DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Been happening for… a while now. Can’t quite put my finger on when it started, truthfully. Just… noticed it more and more. Hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. We’ll do our best to figure things out. When you say "a while now," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe six months? A year? It’s hard to say. Time… it just slips away, you know? I used to work at the water treatment plant – lots of pipes, lots of dials… needed steady hands for that. Not so much anymore, thankfully. Retired now, so it doesn’t matter as much, but it's still… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re addressing it now, even in retirement. Has the shaking been gradually worsening over that six to twelve month period, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: Stable… no, not stable, I don't think. It comes and goes, but when it’s going, it’s… more noticeable. Used to be able to hold a coffee cup just fine. Now… well, let’s just say there’s been a few spills. Nothing major, but enough to be irritating. Is that… helpful? I forget what details are important.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Jezik. The fact that it comes and goes and has worsened over time gives us some important clues. Does anything specific seem to trigger the shaking, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Triggers… now that you mention it…stress, maybe? Thinking too much. Used to be able to solve any problem, quick as a wink. Now… my mind wanders. And…cold weather. Definitely worse when it’s cold. I used to enjoy tinkering in the garage, but it's harder when my hands are shivering so much I can’t even hold a wrench.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress and cold weather as potential triggers. That's good to know. Now, besides your hands, have you noticed any shaking in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… other parts… I suppose I feel a little… unsteady on my feet sometimes. Not falling or anything, just a bit wobbly. And… my voice… sometimes it trembles a bit when I’m talking, especially if I’m tired. I just figured it was old age, you know? Everything starts to… loosen up. I don’t pay much mind to it, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're bringing these things to my attention, even if you've been attributing them to age. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, my blood pressure’s been a little high, Doctor. The doctor at the plant told me years ago to watch my salt intake. I mostly ignore it, to be honest. And… my knees are bad. Arthritis, I think. Hurts to walk long distances. Other than that… not much. I was always pretty healthy, worked hard my whole life. Didn’t see much need for doctors, if I could avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and arthritis in your knees. Thank you. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… Years ago, I had my appendix out, when I was a young man. And… oh, I had a hernia repaired, maybe twenty years ago? That’s about it, I believe. Nothing major. I’ve been lucky, really. Mostly just bumps and bruises from working with pipes and machinery. Nothing to write home about. Is that… enough detail? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing fine, Mr. Jezik. This is very helpful. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My parents… they’re both gone now. My father died of… something with his heart, I think. And my mother… she had a lot of aches and pains when she got older, but I don't recall anything specific. I have a sister, but we haven't spoken in years. Divorced her husband, and well, things were said. I don't know much about her health, truthfully. We lost touch a long time ago. Sorry I can’t be more help on that front. My memory's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. It's common to have gaps in family history information. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she used to smoke. Gave it up years ago, thankfully. Bad habit, always thought. I always preferred a good beer after a long day at the plant, but even that… I don’t drink much anymore. It doesn’t sit well with the medication they gave me for the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, limited alcohol consumption. Do you live alone, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I live alone. Divorced many years ago, like I said. No children, unfortunately. Always wanted them, but… it didn’t work out. It’s quiet, living alone. Sometimes too quiet. I keep busy, tinkering in the garage when the weather's nice, reading the newspaper, watching a bit of television. Just… trying to keep myself occupied, you know? It's a simple life, but it's my own.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of. Once, I had a bit of a rash after taking some… pink pill the doctor gave me, but I don't recall what it was for. My wife handled most of the medication back then. I’ve never had any problems with food, thankfully. I like a good Czech meal – dumplings, sauerkraut, roast pork… nothing fancy. I just eat what tastes good, and usually, that's all. I’m pretty lucky, never been much of a complainer, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. That’s very helpful information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with quickly, if you could, Doctor. I have… things to do. Not important things, mind you, but things nonetheless. I appreciate your time, and I’d like to get this sorted as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. We’ll move as efficiently as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Alright, Mr. Jezik, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/85. Your pulse is regular, but a little fast at 88 beats per minute. I noted a slight tremor in your hands, which seems more pronounced on the right side. Your reflexes are normal, but your gait is a little unsteady, and your coordination appears slightly impaired. I also noticed a very subtle rigidity in your arms when I moved them. All together, this is concerning for essential tremor. However, we’ll need some further tests to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Essential… what now? Is that bad? Sounds… serious. I just figured it was old age, Doctor. Like everything else… loosening up. Tests? What kind of tests? And how long will that take? I’m not good with waiting, you see. Gets me anxious, just thinking about it. I really just wanted a simple answer, a pill maybe… is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Jezik. Essential tremor is a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome, as you’ve described. While it can be managed with medication and sometimes other therapies, it's important to determine the cause of the tremor to ensure there isn’t something else going on. To that end, I’d like to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll also order a thyroid function test, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause tremors. Additionally, I’d like to schedule you for a neurological consultation with Dr. Anya Petrova. She’s a specialist who can perform a more detailed examination and potentially order imaging tests like an MRI of the brain, if she deems it necessary. The blood tests should be relatively quick – just a few vials of blood. Dr. Petrova’s appointment availability varies, but I can have my assistant schedule you for the earliest possible opening, likely within the next two to three weeks. The neurological exam itself will take about 30-45 minutes. It will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on and the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable to you, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Two to three weeks… that feels like a lifetime. I just want to know what’s happening. And an MRI… is that… safe? I've heard stories… But, I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? Blood tests are fine, I can handle a few needles. And I guess I'll see this Dr. Petrova. Is she… good? And will she… explain things clearly? I don't understand all this medical jargon, Doctor. I just want a simple answer, if that's possible. Can you promise me that she’ll try to explain it in plain English? I appreciate you taking the time to listen, though. It’s… reassuring, at least. Just… let’s get this over with quickly, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Jezik, and I will do everything I can to expedite the process. Dr. Petrova is an excellent neurologist with a very good reputation. She is known for her thoroughness and her ability to explain complex medical concepts in a clear and understandable manner. I will make a note in your chart specifically requesting that she take the time to explain everything to you in plain English. The MRI is generally very safe. You will be asked to lie still inside a large magnet, and the machine will take detailed images of your brain. There is no radiation involved. The technician will be able to hear you during the scan, and you will be given earplugs to minimize noise. We’ll also review your medical history to ensure there are no contraindications, such as any metal implants. I’ll have my assistant schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, and we’ll work on getting you an appointment with Dr. Petrova as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as increased shaking, difficulty walking, or speech problems—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… get it done quickly. And please, tell Dr. Petrova to explain things slowly. I’m an old man, my brain doesn’t work as fast as it used to. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… helpful, at least. I appreciate you listening to me ramble on. I’m sure you have other patients waiting. Just… let’s get this over with, shall we?
