DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don't have a lot of time for chit-chat. It's my stomach, alright? Been feeling… puffy. Bloated. Like I swallowed a beach ball. Just wanna get this sorted and get out of here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no problem at all. Puffy and bloated… I understand you want to get to the bottom of this quickly. And we will. When did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It's not like it's constant, you know? Just… inconvenient. Honestly, my wife always handled the doctor stuff. It’s… hard to remember details now. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, yes. That's quite alright. We can work with that. A few weeks, comes and goes… That gives us something to start with. Now, can you describe the bloating a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… big. My stomach gets hard and sticks out. Feels full even if I haven’t eaten much. And sometimes… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… pressurized. Like there’s too much air in there. Does that make sense? Look, I do heavy work, okay? Pile driving. I don't have time for delicate descriptions.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kristofik. Hard, sticks out, feels full quickly, pressurized… Pile driving, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, pile driving. It’s what I do. Been doing it for twenty years. Maybe it’s something to do with that? All the vibrations and stuff. I don't know. Look, doc, are we getting anywhere with this or what? I got a job site waiting.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Kristofik. The vibrations could be a factor, yes. It’s good you mention that. Now, has anything changed in your diet lately?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. I eat what I always eat. Meat, rice, vegetables… nothing fancy. My wife did most of the cooking, and I haven’t… bothered changing things much since she passed. I grab things from the store, heat ‘em up. Simple. I doubt it’s the food.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just from the work, right? Long hours, heavy lifting… Nothing specific to do with the stomach, I don't think. No pain, no… you know, other issues. Just the puffiness. Look, is this going to involve a lot of tests? I really don’t have the patience for that right now.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily a lot of tests, Mr. Kristofik. Let's just do a quick physical exam first, alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be comfortable. And if it takes long, I'm leaving. Seriously. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfectly understandable. Let's start with listening to your abdomen. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I just need to listen for any unusual sounds. And then I’ll gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. It shouldn't take long. Just relax as best you can. Breathe normally, please. Now, does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No. It’s just… weird. Feeling someone poke around. But no, no actual pain. It’s… just strange. Get it over with, doc. Honestly, I'd rather be out there working. This is… a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, good. I’m feeling some slight… distension, as you mentioned. And some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. I don’t feel any masses. Bowel sounds are present, though a bit… sluggish. Now, could you please stand up and let me observe your posture and movements?
PATIENT: Fine. There. Happy now? Just tell me what you think is wrong. I got a site to run, you know. I can't just sit around all day. It's costing me money.
DOCTOR: Alright. You seem to be carrying a bit of weight in the abdomen, and there is some slight… guarding when I ask you to bend forward. Now, this could be a number of things, Mr. Kristofik. It could be something simple like trapped gas or a mild dietary issue. But given the sluggish bowel sounds and tenderness, I think it's worth ruling out a few other possibilities. Would you be willing to do a simple blood test to check for inflammation?
PATIENT: Inflammation? Look, doc, I told you, I don't have time for a lot of tests. I'm a pile driver, not a patient. A little bloating isn't worth poking around with blood. Is there a pill you can give me or something? Something to get rid of the gas? Honestly, that's probably all it is. Just gas. Waste of time, all of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your frustration. We can try a medication to help with the gas, but it’s important to understand that if the symptoms persist, or worsen, we’ll need to investigate further. I’m concerned about the sluggish bowel sounds, and while it could be gas, it's best to be cautious. I’m going to prescribe you Simethicone, an over-the-counter medication to relieve gas. Take it as directed on the packaging. And I'm going to recommend a high-fiber diet and plenty of water to help regulate your bowel movements. If the bloating doesn’t improve within a week, or if you develop any fever, nausea, vomiting, or significant abdominal pain, please come back immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Gas pills and fiber. Whatever. Just… write it down and let me go. I need to get back to work. Honestly, I’m wasting a whole day on this. .
DOCTOR: Here you are. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. I’ll also send a summary of our discussion to your electronic health record. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Kristofik. I wish you all the best, and hopefully, this resolves quickly.
