DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Reisig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, she said I need to get some papers… something about time off? From… work. I handle a lot of things at the church, you see. I forget the exact name of the papers, but she said it has to do with… missing some time. Is that making any sense? I’m a little foggy this morning.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you may need a medical note for some time away from your work at the church. We can certainly get that sorted out. Before we focus on that, though, I'd like to understand what’s been going on with your health that prompted your wife to suggest this. Could you tell me a bit about why you’re seeking medical attention today?
PATIENT: Oh… right. Well, honestly, I’ve been feeling… off. Just tired, mostly. And… little things. Like forgetting where I put my keys, or… names. It’s been happening more lately. Not all the time, but enough that my wife got worried. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But she insisted I come see someone. I haven’t been sick sick, if that makes sense. No fever, no cough… just… fuzzy. Does that sound… important?
DOCTOR: It absolutely sounds important, Mr. Limtiaco. Feeling “off,” as you describe it, and experiencing increasing forgetfulness are things we definitely want to investigate. It’s good that your wife encouraged you to come in. It's not unusual to experience changes with age, but it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I’m falling asleep all day, or anything. It’s more like… a weight. Like I’m dragging myself through things. Even things I usually enjoy at the church. Preaching, teaching… even just talking to the community. It takes a lot more effort. And I sleep… okay, I guess. But I don’t feel rested when I wake up. Like I haven’t really slept at all. It’s been going on for… oh, gosh. A few months, I think? Maybe longer. Time just… slips away.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite draining, and it’s good you’re recognizing these changes. Feeling unrefreshed after sleep despite getting enough hours is significant. A few months is definitely long enough to warrant a thorough look. Could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life, actually. Had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… but nothing serious. I broke my arm once, falling out of a coconut tree when I was a boy – that’s a story for another day! Uh… I had my blood pressure checked regularly for a while, maybe ten years ago? The doctor said it was a little high, but he put me on a diet and exercise… and it went down. I think. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be, so I can’t recall all the details. No major surgeries, no… chronic illnesses, that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, I suppose. Besides the blood pressure check-up, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No major medical history is good. And it's alright about the memory lapses – we’ll take things at your pace. You mentioned your blood pressure was checked about ten years ago, and improved with diet and exercise. Do you recall if you were ever prescribed any medications for that?
PATIENT: You know, I think… yes. I believe the doctor gave me a little white pill. Just one a day, I think. But it made me feel… strange. Sort of dizzy, and… tired. So, my wife and I, we talked about it, and I just decided to try the diet and exercise instead. It worked for a while, I think, but… well, that was a long time ago. I don’t remember the name of the pill, or anything about it. Just that it didn’t feel good, so I stopped taking it. It was a long time ago, Doctor. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s perfectly alright. Many people stop taking medications if they experience unpleasant side effects, and the details sometimes fade with time. Knowing you tried medication previously is helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Currently? Hmm… let me think. I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands, keeps them from getting too stiff. It’s… a small brown pill. My wife gets it for me, she handles most of the medication stuff. And sometimes I take Tylenol, if my hands are really bothering me. Other than that… I don’t think so. Just the arthritis pill and the occasional Tylenol. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis medication and occasional Tylenol. Do you happen to know the name of the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you’re really testing my memory, Doctor! Let me think… the bottle is blue. That’s something, right? And it starts with a… “N”? No, “M”? It's small letters, I think… maybe “naproxen”? Is that right? It sounds familiar, but I’m not positive. My wife will know for sure, she keeps a list of everything I take. I’m really sorry, I wish I could be more accurate. This whole thing is making my head spin a little.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. "Naproxen" sounds very plausible, and that's a helpful start. It's perfectly understandable that it’s difficult to recall everything. The important thing is that you’re taking something for your arthritis. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything, that I know of. I eat all sorts of things, my wife loves to cook, and she uses lots of different spices and flavors. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I remember my grandmother being allergic to bee stings, but I’ve never had a problem with them. I think I’m pretty lucky, allergy-wise. I haven’t really ever had to worry about it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Limtiaco. No known allergies is helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it wasn't a pretty sight. My wife wouldn't allow it, either. She’s a very… health-conscious woman. So, no, no smoking here. Always been a clean liver, you could say. I do enjoy a little wine with dinner sometimes, a small glass. But that’s about it. Nothing else, I promise.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And do you drink alcohol frequently?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Maybe once or twice a week? With dinner, like I said. Just a small glass of red wine. My wife and I, we enjoy it with our meals. It’s not something we do every day, or anything like that. Mostly just on the weekends, or when we're celebrating something special. It’s not a habit, I assure you. More of a… treat.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My family is… big. And scattered all over Tahiti, you see. It’s hard to keep track of everything. I know my grandfather died of… something heart-related, I think. My grandmother had… arthritis, like me. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. But honestly, it’s all a little foggy. We didn’t have a lot of doctors back then, and people didn’t talk about these things as much. It's hard for me to give you a really clear answer, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s very common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially if relatives live far away or there wasn't regular access to healthcare. You've given me a good start with the heart condition, arthritis, and high blood pressure. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief neurological assessment. It’ll help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I'm not worried about needles, or anything like that, but… I do get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up quickly, just so you know. You might want to have me hold onto something. But go ahead, do what you need to do. I'm here to help, if I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That’s good to know about the dizziness. Please, have a seat on the examination table. We'll take things slowly, and I’ll make sure you're comfortable. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. Your lungs sound clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, and your balance is slightly unsteady. Now, could you tell me if you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Well, my hands ache sometimes, like I said. Especially in the mornings, or when it’s cold. And… sometimes I get a little bit of a headache, right here on the side of my head. Not a terrible headache, just… a dull ache. And… oh, now that you mention it, my feet have been tingling a little bit lately. Mostly in the evenings. It’s not constant, just… comes and goes. I thought it was just from being on my feet too long at church. But maybe it's something more? I don’t know. Everything feels a little… off, Doctor. Like all these little things are adding up.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That's helpful information. The aching hands, headaches, and tingling feet are all things we need to investigate. Given your symptoms – fatigue, forgetfulness, slightly elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, unsteady balance, and the recent onset of tingling in your feet – I’d like to order some blood work and a Vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a thyroid panel to rule out any thyroid issues. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine, I'm not afraid of needles. And a… what was it? Thyroid something? Yes, fine. Anything to get to the bottom of this. My wife will be glad you're being so thorough. She's the one who insisted I come see you in the first place. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask? And… about those papers for work? Will the blood work help with those, too? I need to get that FMLA or disability thing sorted out.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely not too much to ask, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. The blood work will help us determine if there's a medical reason for your symptoms, which is often required for FMLA or disability paperwork. Once we have the results, we can discuss them with you and determine the best course of action. I’ll also provide you with a note for your employer detailing your visit and current symptoms. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin B12 level. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll give you instructions on how to fast if needed. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Fasting… right. I remember my wife telling me something about not eating before blood work. I’ll just make sure to ask the nurse when she comes in. Oh, wait… one question. How long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep my work waiting too long. They've been very understanding so far, but I don't want to push my luck. And… will the results tell us what’s causing all this… fuzziness? Is it something serious? I'm trying not to worry, but it's hard. I just want to get back to my church, and my community. They need me, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s completely understandable to be concerned and want answers quickly. The results usually take between 24-48 hours to come back. I will call you as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. As for whether it’s something serious, it’s too early to say. Many things can cause these symptoms – everything from a simple vitamin deficiency to something more complex. The blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. We'll take things one step at a time, and I will explain everything clearly as we go. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. We want to rule out anything urgent. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very… reassuring. Thank you for listening. My wife will be so relieved to hear you're taking good care of me. She worries a lot. Just… tell me one more thing. You don't think this is… something like Alzheimer's, do you? That's what my aunt passed away from, and… it's scary.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Limtiaco, and I understand why you’d ask that. It's good that you’re thinking about all the possibilities. While some of your symptoms could be associated with early cognitive decline, it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. Many things can cause forgetfulness and fatigue, and we need to rule out other potential causes first – such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or medication side effects – before we consider that possibility. The blood work will give us a lot of valuable information. And even if further investigation is needed, there are many things we can do to help manage cognitive decline if that’s the case. We will address any concerns you have, one step at a time. The nurse should be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll see you again once the results are back. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I… I feel a little better now, just knowing you’re taking care of it. My wife will be happy to hear that. I guess… I’ll just wait for the nurse.
