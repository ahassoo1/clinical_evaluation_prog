DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s just… my stomach’s been botherin’ me. Seems like I don't get much appetite anymore, and I feel full awful quick when I do eat. It’s been goin’ on for a little bit now, and it’s… well, it’s worryin’ me some. I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. Things don’t stick in my head like they used to.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Loss of appetite and feeling full quickly… That is something we should look into. You said “a little bit now”… can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate… Let me think. It feels like… maybe since spring? Or was it summer? Everything kinda blurs together these days. It’s not like a sharp pain, you understand. Just… not hungry, and then full after just a few bites. I used to be able to eat a good plate of food, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, spring or summer… a few months then. And no sharp pain, just decreased appetite and early fullness. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Now that you mention it… I’ve been feelin’ a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. And… sometimes a little bit queasy, but not enough to… well, you know. Not sick to my stomach, just kinda unsettled. Hard to describe, really. It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and a bit of nausea alongside the appetite changes… Okay. Have you noticed any weight loss, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Weight loss… That’s a good question, Doctor. I… I haven’t been weighin’ myself regularly. My daughter, bless her heart, she checks on me, but I don’t think she’s mentioned anything. I feel like my clothes might be a little looser, but… I could just be imaginin’ things. My memory ain’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, memory issues can certainly make it hard to keep track of things. Okay. Let’s take a look at your chart. Hmm. It looks like your last recorded weight was… six months ago, and it was 56 kilograms. Alright. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Oh dear. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well… they seem pretty normal, I suppose. Not constipated, not… the other way, either. Just… regular. I haven't noticed anything unusual there, no. It’s just my stomach that’s been botherin’ me, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, I mentioned a little queasiness, didn’t I? But no, no actual vomitin’. Just that unsettled feelin’. It comes and goes, really. It’s not constant. And it’s not… violent, or anything. Just enough to make me lose my appetite, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking any medications currently, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I take somethin’ for my arthritis, a little pill in the mornin’. And somethin’ for my blood pressure, too. I can’t rightly remember the names of ‘em, though. My daughter keeps track of all that. I just take what she gives me, bless her heart. And… that’s about it, I think. Oh, and a vitamin D, but that’s… hardly a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. Arthritis medication, blood pressure medication, and vitamin D. We'll get the exact names from your daughter, that’s good. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I used to be able to eat just about anythin’, but… well, things are different now, aren’t they? I don't recall ever havin' an allergy. My daughter always asks me when I see a new doctor, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then feel your abdomen. Just relax for me, Ms. Kelder. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels tender or painful. Does this bother you at all?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little uncomfortable, Doctor. Not painful, exactly, but… tender. Right about there. It’s been feelin’ kinda… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. Just a dull ache, really. Like somethin’s… pressin’ on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And what about here?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a little… yeah, that feels a bit like it too. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feelin’. It's hard to explain, Doctor. I just don’t feel right, and my appetite’s just gone. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… everything feels like such an effort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant and below the ribcage. Okay, Ms. Kelder. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be a few things. Given your age, the early fullness, and the tenderness, we need to rule out some possibilities. I want to order some blood work to check your liver function, and I’d also like to get an ultrasound of your abdomen to take a closer look at your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an ultrasound… Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong, and get it fixed, if possible. I trust your judgment. I don’t understand much about all that, but… if it’ll help me feel better, I’m willing to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and schedule the ultrasound for you. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of the blood work. The ultrasound technician will call you to schedule an appointment. Now, while we're waiting for the results, I'd recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding anything fatty or fried. That might help with the fullness and nausea. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… yes, I can try that. But… what could it be, Doctor? You said “rule out some possibilities.” Is it… serious? I don’t want to worry my daughter, but… I like to know what I’m dealin’ with. I understand if you don't want to say, but... even a little bit of information might ease my mind.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Kelder, it's too early to say definitively. It could be something as simple as indigestion or a gallbladder issue. But given your symptoms and age, we need to rule out things like liver problems or, less commonly, something more serious. The blood work and ultrasound will give us a much clearer picture. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s best to be thorough. We’re just gathering information at this point. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Gatherin’ information. That makes sense. It’s just… worryin’, you know? I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter. She does so much for me already. But… I appreciate you bein’ thorough. And… explainin’ things to me. It’s… comforting, somehow. So, just smaller meals, and wait for the tests… alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s right. Smaller meals, and we'll wait for the test results. I'll have the nurse give you a handout with some dietary recommendations. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results, usually within a few days. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or yellowing of your skin or eyes before then, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you. Thank you for listenin’ to me, and for takin’ the time to explain things. I feel a little better just knowin’ you’re lookin’ into it. Tell the nurse to just send that handout with the diet stuff, and I’ll try my best. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. You’re very welcome. I’ll have the nurse bring that handout right over. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
