DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my hearing, mostly. It comes and goes, you see. And…and sometimes the room just spins. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. My daughter, she insisted I come. Said it runs in the family, something about…well, I can’t quite recall exactly what she said.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in; it's always best to get things checked out. Hearing changes and dizziness can be a number of things, and we want to figure out what’s going on. Let’s start with the hearing. When did you first notice it coming and going?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a good question. It feels like…a while now. Months, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. It just…happens. One day it’s fine, the next it's a bit muffled. Not completely gone, just…not as clear. And it usually goes away on its own after a bit. It’s very… unpredictable, you see. I don’t remember anything specific that started it.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable hearing loss that comes and goes over months. That gives us a starting point. And you mentioned the room spinning – is that happening at the same time as the hearing changes, or does it happen separately?
PATIENT: Hmm… Usually together, I think. When my hearing gets bad, that's when the spinning starts. Not always, but most of the time. It doesn't last long, thankfully. Just…a few minutes, maybe an hour at most. It’s…disorienting, you know? Makes it hard to even stand up. But it goes away like the hearing does. I just try to sit down when it happens.
DOCTOR: Right, so hearing loss and dizziness occurring together, typically lasting a few minutes to an hour. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: No, not really. It just…happens. I haven't been doing anything different, not that I can recall. I mostly stay home, you see. Quiet life. I do a bit of gardening sometimes, but nothing strenuous. No loud noises, no traveling…nothing that would explain it, I don't think. It's very frustrating, honestly. I wish I knew what was causing it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Mayhugh. It's unsettling when things happen without a clear cause. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. Well, the doctor always says my blood pressure is a bit high, but I take a little pill for it. Just a small one, every morning. And… I had a bad flu a few years back, nearly ended up in the hospital, but I recovered. That's all I can really think of. Nothing else major, I don’t believe. I'm usually a pretty healthy person, all things considered. I try to eat right… well, as right as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage high blood pressure with medication, and you had a severe flu a few years ago. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a tricky one. It’s… a small white pill. That’s all I really remember. My daughter handles most of the refills, you see. She reminds me to take it every morning. I'm afraid I don't pay much attention to the names of things. I just know I have to take it with my breakfast. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Don't worry about it at all. We can look it up in your records. Ah, here we are. You're currently taking Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, that’s it! Yes, that's the one. Thank goodness your records are so good. Surgeries… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago, but that's about it. And the hospital for the flu, of course. But nothing else. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Avoided anything serious. I just want to get this hearing thing sorted out. It's getting a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries other than tonsillectomy as a child and one hospitalization for the flu. Now, let's talk about your family. Has anyone else in your family experienced hearing loss or dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh yes, now that you mention it… my mother, she had trouble hearing in her later years. Very bad trouble. She needed a hearing aid, eventually. And… my brother, he used to get terrible dizzy spells when he was younger. The doctor said something about his inner ear, but I can’t quite remember the details. It wasn't as bad as what I'm experiencing, I don't think. But yes, it does run in the family, like my daughter said. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hearing loss in your mother and dizziness in your brother. That's helpful information. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Never had any trouble with that. I eat most things, and I can take any medication without any problems. My daughter always checks, just in case, but I've never had a reaction to anything. Lucky again, I suppose. I'm starting to feel a bit tired now, if you don't mind. Is this nearly finished?
DOCTOR: No allergies, that’s good to know. And yes, we are almost finished with the initial questions. Just one last thing - are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just the Lisinopril for my blood pressure. Sometimes I take a little something for a headache, but that's only when I really need it. Nothing regularly, though. Are you sure? My daughter sometimes brings me things… but I don’t usually remember. I really would like to finish up now, if that's alright. It’s been a bit… taxing, trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the Lisinopril and occasional over-the-counter pain medication. Let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, and do a brief neurological exam, including some balance tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it's necessary. But please be gentle. I’m a bit… sensitive. And please don’t take too long. I’m starting to feel a little dizzy already, just talking about it. Just let me know what you’re doing, alright? It helps to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I’ll explain everything as I go. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, let's take a look in your ears. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear intact, but slightly dull in color. No signs of infection or fluid. Next, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… this is making me a bit nervous. Please hold my arm, just in case. It’s… difficult to balance, even with my eyes closed. I always felt a little wobbly, but it's worse now. Is this normal? I don't usually fall, but I'm careful.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are a bit unsteady, which is understandable with your reported dizziness. You have some difficulty maintaining your balance with your eyes closed, exhibiting a slight sway. This could indicate a vestibular issue – a problem with the inner ear. Could you please walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear… This is… difficult. Very difficult. I’m afraid I can’t walk a straight line very well. It’s like… I can’t tell where my feet are. Is something seriously wrong? I’m starting to feel quite frightened.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Please don’t be frightened. You don’t need to force yourself. Your difficulty walking in a straight line, combined with your reported dizziness and unsteadiness, further suggests a possible vestibular problem. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it seems likely that you’re experiencing some form of inner ear dysfunction. This could be related to a number of things, including Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo , Vestibular Neuritis, or Meniere’s disease. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test and vestibular function testing. They can assess your hearing and inner ear function in detail. We may also want to consider an MRI to rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s been worrying me for a long time. An audiologist… and an MRI… that sounds… complicated. Will you help me arrange everything? I’m afraid I’m not very good with these things. And please… try to make it as quick as possible. I’ve already been through so much, just trying to remember everything. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. I will absolutely help you arrange everything. My nurse will contact you to schedule an appointment with a trusted audiologist in the area. We’ll also get the MRI referral processed. It might take a few days to get the MRI scheduled, but we’ll do our best to expedite the process. In the meantime, avoid any sudden movements or strenuous activities. If you experience severe dizziness that lasts for an extended period, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as headache, fever, or double vision, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m also going to prescribe a medication called Meclizine to help manage your dizziness symptoms. It’s an antihistamine that can help reduce nausea and improve your balance. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
