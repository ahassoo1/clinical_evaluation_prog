DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s… disruptive, to be frank. I’m not sure when it started, precisely. Things feel a little hazy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. Hmm. Vague recollections aren’t particularly helpful, you know. But alright. Can you quantify “a lot”?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. It’s just… life has been rather full. Let me see… normally, I’d go, perhaps four or five times a day? Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes more. And… I’ve woken up a few times in the night needing to go. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… frequent. I apologize for not being more precise. I wish I could give you a better answer.
DOCTOR: Frequent… waking at night… Alright. And is it a full bladder each time, or just… a little bit?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… hmm. I believe it is a full bladder each time, yes. Not just a dribble, if that makes sense. It feels like a normal amount, just… too often. I haven’t noticed any change in… color or anything unusual, if that’s relevant. Is it important to mention that? I always worry about offering too much detail, or not enough.
DOCTOR: It’s always preferable to be thorough, Ms. MacVittie. Though, frankly, some patients overshare. No color changes, you say. Any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No burning at all, and no discomfort either. It's really just the frequency. It doesn’t hurt to go, it’s just… inconvenient. And a little concerning, naturally. I haven’t been able to pinpoint anything that makes it better or worse, either. I’ve tried… well, I haven’t consciously tried anything, to be honest. I just assumed it would resolve itself. Perhaps that was foolish.
DOCTOR: Assuming things will resolve on their own… a common mistake. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your thirst levels?
PATIENT: That’s a good point… let me think. I don’t believe so, Doctor. I drink a normal amount of water, I suppose. Perhaps a little more lately, simply because I’m going to the bathroom so often. But I wouldn’t say I’ve been exceptionally thirsty. No, nothing like that. I haven't been feeling particularly dry either. It's just… the bathroom visits. It’s quite a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of… let’s say, bladder issues?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family isn’t terribly forthcoming with medical details, I’m afraid. My mother… she had some health problems, but I wasn’t privy to specifics. She wasn’t one for sharing. And my father… he passed away when I was young. I don’t believe anyone specifically mentioned bladder problems, no. I apologize for being unhelpful. It’s not that I don’t want to provide information, it’s just… I don't have it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Understandable, though frustrating. Alright. Let’s move on to other matters. Any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I haven't altered my diet significantly. I eat a fairly standard diet, I suppose. Nothing particularly spicy or… diuretic, if that's the word. I do enjoy coffee, I must admit, but I've been drinking coffee for years, and haven’t increased my intake lately. I'm trying to recall anything unusual… but nothing comes to mind. I feel like I'm failing at this whole medical history thing. Is there a particular thing I should be focusing on?
DOCTOR: You're not failing, Ms. MacVittie. You're simply… lacking in detail. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll listen to your abdomen and do a quick neurological check. It’s routine.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate the reassurance. I’ll lie down on the examination table. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, Ms. MacVittie. Relax your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, sensation intact. No lower extremity weakness. Nothing remarkable on initial examination.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Though, I confess, I’m not entirely sure what “2+ bilaterally” means. But if it’s good, that’s good. So, what’s the next step? Do you think it might be something serious? I do apologize for being so anxious. It’s just… the frequency is rather disruptive to my work.
DOCTOR: Disruptive to your work… Of course. Alright, Ms. MacVittie. Given your symptoms, and the unremarkable physical exam, it could be a number of things. A simple urinary tract infection is possible, even without fever or discomfort. We'll need to run a urinalysis to rule that out. Also, given your age and the frequency, we should check a post-void residual to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. It's unlikely to be something serious, but we need to be thorough. I'll order the tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a urine sample.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if it is a little… inconvenient. A urine sample and a post-void residual… I can certainly manage that. And you think it’s unlikely to be serious? That does ease my mind somewhat. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, unlikely. Though, do not delay seeking further attention if you develop fever, flank pain, or blood in your urine. I’ll have the nurse come in now, and we’ll get the tests ordered. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions before she arrives.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I understand. No fever, flank pain, or blood in the urine. I’ll keep a close watch. And… no, I don’t believe I have any further questions at the moment. I’ll wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll leave you to it then.
PATIENT: .
