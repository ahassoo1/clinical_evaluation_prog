DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It nice to meet you as well. Well, I been feelin’ a little… off lately. I drinkin’ plenty water, more than usual, and still feel thirsty. And I hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. That does sound concerning. Increased thirst and hunger, even after eating, are definitely things we need to look into. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start… maybe about a month or so ago? Not right away, it build up slow. First it was just feelin’ a little more thirsty than normal, then I start reachin’ for snacks more often. Now, it constant. I does try to ignore it, but it hard, you know? Especially with the heat we havin’ now.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual onset over a month is helpful to know. And you're right, this heat certainly doesn't help. Have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I been goin’ to the bathroom more often too. Especially at night. It botherin’ my sleep a little. And I feel a little tired, more than usual. I thought it was just the heat, but… maybe it not just that. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. Increased urination, especially at night, and fatigue… those are important details. Do you have any trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not really. I wear glasses, always have, but I don't think my vision get worse. I does see a little blurry sometimes, but that normal for me, you know? I get my glasses check every year. No change there. I think.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know about your regular eye exams. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with anything. I does get a little aches and pains like everyone else, but nothing serious. I try to stay active, walk around the garden, that sort of thing. My husband, he does take me to the doctor for check-ups when I need them, but they always say I healthy enough. I never been sick for long, nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. I does try to avoid the hospital if I could, you know? I prefer to stay home and rest if I feel sick. My mother always say, “Fresh air and a good cup of tea is the best medicine!” She was a wise woman, my mother.
DOCTOR: I agree, a little rest and good care can go a long way. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has diabetes or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had some problems with her sugar, yes. The doctor told her she had the sugar sickness, but she didn't like takin’ pills. She tried to manage it with diet, mostly. My father, he healthy as a horse, always workin’ in the fields. And my brother, he live in America, I don’t hear from him much. I don’t know nothin’ about his health. But yes, my mother, she had the sugar problems. A long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information about your mother. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any pills. I does take a little vitamin C sometimes, when I feel a cold comin’ on, but that's it. I don't like takin’ medicine if I could avoid it. I believe in natural remedies, you know? Like ginger tea for a stomach ache, or aloe vera for burns. That sort of thing. No pills, just good home remedies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. No medications, just vitamins and home remedies. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Never had any problems with allergies. I does get bitten by mosquitoes sometimes, but that's just the bush life, you know? Nothing serious. I can eat anything, no problems there. No allergies, no pills, just good home remedies and fresh air. That's me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also do a basic neurological exam and check your feet. It shouldn't take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that alright. You does what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's goin’ on with me. Check my blood pressure and everything, you does what you need to do. I will just sit here, nice and quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. Your heart rate is also a little faster than normal. Lungs sound clear. Now I'm going to check your reflexes and your feet. Alright. Your reflexes are good. I did notice a little decreased sensation in your feet. This means you may not feel pain or temperature as well as you should in your feet. Do you notice that yourself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I never really pay attention to my feet, to be honest. I does wear slippers most of the time, you know? And I walk barefoot in the garden sometimes, but I never feel anything bad. Maybe it the slippers. They a little old now, I suppose. I never notice anythin' wrong, though. But if you say so, maybe I been missin' somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. It's good to be aware of. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and other important factors. We’ll also do a urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Blood tests and urine test, you does what you need to do. Whatever it take to find out what's goin' on with me. I trust your judgment. Where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take? I have to get back to help my husband with the garden, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. The nurse, Nurse Evelyn, will draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It should take about 30-45 minutes. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. While we’re waiting for the results, it’s important to be mindful of your fluid intake and any unusual symptoms. If you experience excessive thirst, frequent urination, or any other concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Also, given the decreased sensation in your feet, I recommend wearing closed-toe shoes as much as possible to prevent any injuries. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Room 3, Nurse Evelyn, 30-45 minutes. Closed-toe shoes, be careful with my feet. I understand. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. It nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen, you know? I will go to Room 3 now and get these tests done. I hope it not somethin' too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. Please let Nurse Evelyn know if you have any questions. I will be here when you return with the results. And remember, don't hesitate to call if anything changes. We'll talk soon.
