DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about time someone finally offered a sensible solution. My husband, bless his heart, suggested I come here. He says this… marijuana… might help with my nerves. Honestly, I find the whole thing rather… undignified, but I’m willing to try anything at this point. If it gets me a moment’s peace.
DOCTOR: I see. And these “nerves,” as you call them… can you elaborate on what specifically is causing you distress?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s a host of things, Doctor. Really. The neighborhood has gone completely downhill, for starters. Young people with no respect, playing that dreadful music at all hours. And the taxes! Don't even get me started on the taxes. It’s just… a constant worry. And then there’s my daughter… she simply doesn't understand the importance of proper etiquette. It's exhausting, truly. It keeps me up at night, this constant… disrespect.
DOCTOR: So, this is primarily anxiety related to external stressors – neighborhood changes, financial concerns, and family dynamics. Have you experienced any physical symptoms accompanying this anxiety, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Well, I get a bit… fluttery, sometimes. And my stomach isn’t always quite right. But honestly, Doctor, at my age, something is always a bit off. I don’t make a fuss over every little ache and pain. It’s just… nerves, as I said. I’m not one for complaining. Though, admittedly, I do lose my appetite when things are particularly… upsetting. But that’s hardly a reason to fill myself with… that stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. The fluttery sensation… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Mostly comes and goes, Doctor. It’s worse when… well, when I have to deal with things. Like when I'm paying bills, or when my daughter comes to visit. It’s not a constant state, you understand. I'm not a delicate flower. It’s just… inconvenient. And frankly, the thought of relying on… a plant… to feel normal is rather appalling. I’ve always managed perfectly well on my own, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything in particular triggered these episodes recently?
PATIENT: Triggered? Oh, Doctor, don't get me started. Just last week, young men were loitering on my porch! Loitering, I tell you! And the music! It was… a racket. My husband tried to speak to them, but they just ignored him. It's a complete lack of respect, and it's utterly exhausting. That's what triggered it, if you must know. It's the constant… disorder of things. It truly is.
DOCTOR: I see. And, Ms. Ranells, do you have any history of… depression, or other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: Depression? Doctor, I am a Rannells! We do not succumb to such things. My mother was a pillar of the community, my grandmother raised seven children during the war… we are a strong family. A little anxiety over the state of the world is hardly a cause for… diagnosis. Honestly, I find the implication rather insulting. I simply want a bit of peace and quiet, not a label.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's talk about your medical history then. Do you have any existing medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s a long list. I’m 74 years old! A little arthritis, naturally. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And my eyesight isn't perfect, as you can see. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but it fluctuates. I don’t bother with constant check-ups, it just upsets me. Nothing serious, if that’s what you’re asking. Just the usual ailments of getting older. Nothing that would necessitate… this. I'm not a sickly person.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my knees. A cream, mostly. And I take an aspirin every now and then, if I have a headache. But that’s it, Doctor. I try to avoid pills whenever possible. They just… interfere with things. And frankly, I don’t trust them. I prefer to manage on my own, thank you very much. It's a matter of principle. I don’t want to be dependent on anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Once. A long time ago. When I was young. It was a rather… unpleasant experience. Appendicitis, I believe. And I broke my wrist when I was a child, but that hardly counts. It healed perfectly well on its own. Honestly, Doctor, must we go through every single detail of my life? I came here for a simple thing, not a full medical interrogation. I assure you, I’m a perfectly healthy woman for my age. Despite everything.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. Rannells do not have allergies. We are… robust people. My husband has a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but that’s hardly relevant. I’ve never had a reaction to anything in my life. Honestly, Doctor, are you quite finished with the questions? I’m starting to feel rather… put upon. I came here hoping for a discreet solution, not a grilling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Ranells, I understand your frustration, but this information is vital. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: My family history? Doctor, are you suggesting there's something wrong with my family? We are a distinguished lineage! My grandfather was a lawyer, my great-grandmother was a teacher… We have a history of strong, respectable people. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… insulting. I will not delve into the personal affairs of my ancestors to justify a… plant! It's simply not done. I think I've answered quite enough questions for one morning. If you're not going to help me, I'd like to leave.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, it appears we're not going to get very far with this consultation. I understand you're hesitant about exploring this option. However, without a more complete understanding of your overall health and history, I cannot responsibly advise you. Given your strong objections to providing further information, I recommend you consult with another physician who may be more aligned with your preferences. I wish you all the best.
