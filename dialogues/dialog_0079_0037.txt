DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I have been… how you say… making a whistling sound when I breathe. It happens more when I walk, or… when I try to do my exercises. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound with breathing… and it’s exacerbated by exertion, such as walking or exercise. I see. How long has this been going on, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe two, three weeks now? It started small, I thought it was just because of the heat. But it’s… not going away. It feels… tighter each time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Two to three weeks. And you describe it as a tightening sensation alongside the whistling…Yes, that gives me a little more to work with. Has this been a gradual onset, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… gradual, I think. Not bam, all at once. It started… after I walked a little further than usual, trying to get back to my old routine. I used to be very active, you see. I work with the young athletes. But… now, even a small walk feels hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. A change in activity level can certainly bring these things to light. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the whistling and the tightness, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel a little tired. More tired than usual, even after resting. And… my chest feels… heavy. Not always, but when I am trying to breathe with the whistling, it feels… like someone is sitting on my chest. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and a sensation of chest heaviness… accompanying the whistling sound and tightness, especially with exertion. Alright. Do you happen to have any cough, or bring up any phlegm when you cough?
PATIENT: No cough, Doctor. At least, not a bad one. Sometimes a little tickle in my throat, but nothing… nothing much to speak of. No phlegm, no. My throat is just… dry sometimes.
DOCTOR: No cough, no phlegm… just the dry throat alongside the fatigue and chest heaviness. Very well. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… years ago, when I was younger, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. They gave me some pills for it, but I… I don’t take them anymore. I try to eat healthy, and it seemed to go down on its own. And… my knees, they bother me sometimes. Old sports injury.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, managed previously with medication but currently controlled through diet. And some knee pain related to a prior sports injury. Do you recall what medication you were taking for your blood pressure, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was so long ago. I… I don’t remember the name, Doctor. Small white pill, I think? My husband, he always took care of the medication. Now… I just try to watch what I eat. Lots of vegetables, not much salt.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can look into your medication history through the records. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband used to say I had an iron stomach! No… allergies. I've never had a problem. I can’t remember ever being sick with allergies.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And currently, are you taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my knees. It’s a cream, you rub it on. For the pain. I think it’s called… “Joint Ease”? Something like that. That’s all, Doctor. Just the cream for my knees.
DOCTOR: Topical cream for knee pain, “Joint Ease” – we’ll confirm the ingredients. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I just want to feel better, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly. Listens to lungs with stethoscope, moving to different areas of the chest. Okay… and again. Listens again. Hmm… Pauses, listening closely. I do detect some mild wheezing in your lower lobes, Mrs. Kilton. It’s not pronounced, but it’s present. Taps chest gently. And your chest expansion does seem a bit diminished on both sides. Asks a nurse to bring a peak flow meter Now, I'm going to ask you to exhale firmly into this device to measure your peak flow.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Wheezing… is that bad, Doctor? I don’t understand… what does diminished mean? My chest feels tight, but… I thought that was just because of being old! What is this device for?
DOCTOR: Wheezing indicates some narrowing of the airways, Mrs. Kilton. Diminished chest expansion means your lungs aren’t expanding as fully as they should when you breathe. It's not necessarily a sign of something immediately dire, but it requires investigation. This device, the peak flow meter, measures how forcefully you can exhale air from your lungs. It helps us assess the severity of the narrowing. Demonstrates how to use the device Now, take a deep breath in… and exhale as forcefully and quickly as you can into the mouthpiece. Repeat this three times, and I’ll record the results.
PATIENT: Oh… I see. It’s a little hard to understand all of this, Doctor. I just want to be able to walk my dog again without feeling so tired. Takes a deep breath, trying to follow the instructions, but exhales weakly Is this right? It doesn’t feel like much air is coming out. Repeats twice more with similar results
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mrs. Kilton. It requires a bit of technique. Your peak flow readings are somewhat lower than expected for your age and height. Records the numbers. Now, let's check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Attaches pulse oximeter to patient’s finger. 92%... that’s within a normal range, thankfully. Pauses, making notes on chart. Given your history of hypertension, the wheezing, diminished chest expansion and the somewhat low peak flow, I suspect we're dealing with either early-stage COPD, or possibly asthma that’s developed later in life. However, it's too early to say definitively. We need to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: COPD? Asthma? Oh dear. I… I don’t smoke, Doctor. Never have. Is that… is that something you get from smoking? I just thought it was getting old and being a little out of shape. What does “rule out” mean? Do I need more tests? I’m a little scared now.
DOCTOR: COPD, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, is most commonly associated with smoking, yes. However, it can develop in non-smokers due to other factors, such as environmental irritants or genetics. Asthma can also develop at any age. “Rule out” means we need to perform some tests to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. Pauses, tapping the chart I would like to order a chest X-ray to look for any structural abnormalities in your lungs. I will also order a pulmonary function test, which measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do so. Looks up, speaking slowly This will help us differentiate between COPD, asthma, and other potential causes of your breathing difficulties. pauses Do you have any questions at this point, Mrs Kilton?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? And another test… Oh dear. Will these tests be painful, Doctor? I don't like being poked and prodded. And… will they show something… bad? I'm a little worried about what they might find. And what happens after the tests? Will I need medication? I just want to be able to walk my dog again, like I used to.
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray is painless, Mrs. Kilton. You will simply stand in front of a machine while it takes a picture of your lungs. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a tube for a few minutes. It may be a little tiring, but it’s not painful. pauses As for what they might find… it’s too early to speculate. These tests will simply provide more information, allowing us to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. pauses If it is asthma or early-stage COPD, medication – usually an inhaler – can often help manage the symptoms and improve your breathing. pauses I will have the nurse schedule these tests for you now. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity and ensure you’re getting plenty of rest. pauses Do you understand?
PATIENT: An inhaler… like for asthma? I think my grandson has one of those. frowns Okay. I understand… rest and no strenuous activity. And the tests… okay. Yes, I think I understand. pauses Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything… even if it’s a little scary. Could you… could you write down the name of the tests for me? Just so I remember what I’m supposed to be doing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Kilton. Here you are. It says "Chest X-ray" and "Pulmonary Function Test." The nurse will provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for each test. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them further. pauses, looking at the chart Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so patiently. I’m a little worried, but… I feel better knowing what’s happening. smiles weakly I hope I can walk my dog again soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll do our best to determine the cause of your symptoms and get you back to your activities. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Have a good day, Mrs. Kilton. pauses, glancing up briefly The nurse will escort you out.
