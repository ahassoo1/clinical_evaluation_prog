DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Chora, nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been getting chills lately, and it’s a bit worrying. Not like a cold chill, more… random, you know? They just come and go.
DOCTOR: Okay, random chills… that’s good to know. And how long have these been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe a week or so? It started gradually, just feeling a bit cold now and then, but the last couple of days it's been more noticeable. It doesn't seem to be related to being cold, if that makes sense. I was even wearing a sweater yesterday and still felt a bit shaky.
DOCTOR: Right, not related to temperature. And are you having any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Not really… I mean, I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? No fever, no cough, no sore throat… nothing like a normal cold or flu. Maybe just a tiny bit achy, but that could just be from work, you know? I do a lot of walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, or sore throat. A little fatigue and some aches, possibly work-related. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… actually, yeah. My appetite’s been a bit off. Not that I’m not hungry, just… not as much as usual. And I've been feeling a little thirsty too, I guess. But I drink a lot of water anyway, so I didn't really pay much attention to it.
DOCTOR: Alright, decreased appetite and increased thirst. Okay. And are you having any problems with, say, going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, um… actually, yes. Now that you mention it, I've been going to the bathroom a bit more often. Not like… urgently, just more trips throughout the day. I thought it was just because of the water I'm drinking, but maybe it’s something else? It's not painful or anything, just… more frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urinary frequency. No pain. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing major. No asthma, no diabetes, no heart problems… just the usual childhood stuff, really. I see a dentist regularly, of course, and I had the flu shot last year. I’m generally pretty healthy, honestly. That’s why these chills are so strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant past medical history. Tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm. Regular dental checkups, flu shot last year. Good. Any surgeries besides the tonsils and arm?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. And I don’t take any regular medications, just over-the-counter stuff if I have a headache or something. Vitamins sometimes, but that’s about it. I try to eat healthy and get enough sleep, but… well, life happens, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional over-the-counter pain relievers and vitamins. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had it too. My grandmother on my mother’s side had some sort of arthritis, I think, but I don’t know much about it. And my aunt has… something with her thyroid, but again, I’m not really sure what it is. It’s not something we talk about much in my family, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension, possible arthritis and thyroid issues. Alright. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I work as a Health Education Specialist, so I'm on my feet a lot, doing workshops and visiting people in the community. It's pretty active, but also can be stressful sometimes. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat healthy, like I said, but it’s hard when you're always on the go. And I don't really have any hobbies, to be honest. Just… work, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, active job, non-smoker, rare alcohol use. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to think I was allergic to cats, but I think I was just sensitive to the dander. No serious allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully! I love Moroccan food, and there’s a lot of spices in that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just want to check your temperature, blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Dr. Chora.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 128/78, which is good. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Throat looks clear, no obvious signs of infection. I'm also going to feel your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes feel slightly enlarged, but not significantly. Okay. A few things here. Slightly enlarged lymph nodes, and a bit of fatigue. Given your symptoms – the chills, fatigue, decreased appetite, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency – and the slightly enlarged lymph nodes, I'd like to order some blood work. It’s just to rule out a few things and get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to figure out what’s causing all this. What sort of things are you looking for? If you don't mind me asking.
DOCTOR: We'll check your complete blood count to look at your white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And I'd like to add a thyroid panel, given the family history, and a urinalysis to check for any infection. It’s a pretty standard set of tests, really. With the results, we can see if there is an underlying cause for your symptoms. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. Okay, I'm happy with that. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand? And where will I get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: You do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work. So no food or drinks, except water. You can go to the lab at St. Luke’s Hospital. It’s just down the street here, at 123 Main Street. They're expecting you, and they’ll take good care of you. The lab tech will give you instructions on how to prepare and what to expect. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s pretty clear. Fast for eight hours, go to St. Luke’s Hospital, 123 Main Street. And the lab tech will explain everything. Okay, good. When should I expect to hear back about the results? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, resting, drinking more water…?
DOCTOR: The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. The lab will send them directly to me, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. In the meantime, it's a good idea to rest as much as you can, and continue to drink plenty of water. Try to eat light, easily digestible foods. Don’t push yourself too hard, and if your symptoms get worse – like a high fever, severe fatigue, or difficulty breathing – go to the emergency room right away. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds very reasonable. Rest, drink water, eat light foods… and go to the ER if things get worse. Got it. Thank you, Dr. Chora. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run these tests. I feel a little better just knowing we’re trying to figure things out. I guess I'll go get some rest now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Aslan. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, do take care of yourself. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results.
