DOCTOR: Good morning, San. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card so I can drive people around – a ride-share card, I think they called it? For commercial driving. I need to be legal to do it, you know? I want to get it over with as quickly as possible if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, a commercial driver’s license… or a card, as you say. Yes, perfectly alright. It sounds like you need a Department of Transportation physical. That's what we can do here. Just to confirm, you’re 70 years old, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Seventy. Born in… let me think… 1955. August 12th. I remember dates very well, surprisingly. So, a DOT physical, you say? Is that just a regular check-up, or is it more involved than that? I just want to know what I’m getting into, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Good, that matches up. And yes, you’re right to ask. It is a bit more involved than a regular check-up. It's specifically designed to make sure drivers are physically able to operate a commercial vehicle safely. It includes a detailed review of your medical history, a thorough physical exam – checking your vision, hearing, blood pressure, heart, lungs, reflexes, and a musculoskeletal assessment – and sometimes a urine drug screen. We also need to make sure you understand the requirements for safe driving. Does that all sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Vision and hearing I’m a little worried about, but everything else should be fine. I’ve always been strong, you know, working with the logging equipment. A urine drug screen is… fine, I suppose. I don’t do anything, so that shouldn’t be a problem. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I’m happy to get it done. What's the first thing we do?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Most people feel a little anxious about it, so you’re not alone. Let’s start with your medical history. I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions about past illnesses, surgeries, medications you're taking, and allergies. Then, we'll do the physical exam. We can definitely work quickly, I promise. First, have you had any major illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be thirty years ago now. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder, but that healed fine. Other than that… not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I did have the flu a couple of times, but everyone gets that. Do you want to know about allergies? I don’t really have any serious ones. A little hay fever in the spring, that’s all. I take a blood pressure pill, Lisinopril, once a day. That’s all the medication. And I had a divorce, if that counts as an illness!
DOCTOR: No, I don’t need to know about the divorce! Although, stress can certainly affect your health. The Lisinopril is good to know – thank you. And we’ll definitely keep an eye on your blood pressure during the exam. Thirty years ago for the gallbladder removal is good. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my husband, we’re… separated. Divorced. No children. My mother, she lived to be 95, very healthy, but she did have some heart trouble towards the end. My father passed away when I was young, heart attack, I think. I don’t really have much other family left, to be honest. I don’t keep in touch with many relatives. Does that matter? I just want to get this card and get back to work, you know? I don’t want to spend the whole day talking about my personal life.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. We’ll keep it brief. Knowing about the heart trouble in your mother and the heart attack in your father is helpful. We'll just keep that in mind. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, and it ruined her health. I saw what it did to her. And no, I don't drink alcohol either. Not really my thing. I used to be very active, working outdoors with the logging equipment, but I haven't been doing much lately. Just trying to get back into it. And I eat… reasonably well, I think. Lots of fish, vegetables. Not a lot of fast food. Is that enough information? I really just want to know how long this whole thing will take.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Very good habits. And that’s perfectly alright, we’ll try to make it as quick as possible. Okay, last few quick questions before we move on to the physical exam. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not even penicillin. I can take pretty much anything. I used to have to take ibuprofen for my back when I was working with the equipment, but that didn't bother me. Nothing serious, you know? Can we get to the exam now? My back’s starting to stiffen up just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, fantastic. No known allergies. Wonderful. Yes, let’s get to the physical exam, then. It’ll be a fairly standard exam – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your vision and reflexes, and a quick musculoskeletal assessment. We'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not too concerning. We’ll want to keep an eye on that, though.
PATIENT: Okay. 140 over 85. Is that bad? My blood pressure's always been a little high, the doctor said it was just from stress. I haven't been very stressed lately, though, so it should be better. Can we just get through this quickly, please? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s a little high, yes, but as you said, it can fluctuate. We’ll take it again later. And we will try to be quick, I promise. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles.
PATIENT: Good. That's good. Everything sounds normal. I knew it. Working outside keeps me healthy, you know. The fresh air. Can we get to the vision test now? I'm a little worried about that one. I always had good eyesight, but I'm getting older…
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Let's check your vision now. We'll start with your distance vision. Okay, read the smallest line you can make out. Starting from the top, if you can.
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me see… E… F… P… T… Z… and… um… that one's blurry… and… I think that’s it. I can’t really see the small letters anymore. My glasses are at home. I didn't think I needed them for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s alright, that’s why we’re here. It appears you have some difficulty with your distance vision. We’ll need to have a proper vision test done by an optometrist. This test just gives us a basic idea. Now, let’s check your near vision. Can you read this small print on this card?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… blurry… very blurry. I can make out… some shapes. Letters… maybe. It's really hard. I definitely need my glasses for this. I can barely see anything up close. This is probably going to be a problem, isn't it? I knew I should have brought them.
DOCTOR: It appears you do need corrective lenses. Unfortunately, for the DOT physical, you’ll need to have a full vision exam and meet specific vision requirements. We can’t proceed with the physical without that. I'm going to need you to schedule an appointment with an optometrist for a complete vision exam. Do you have an optometrist you typically see?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't. Not for years. I used to just… see one when I needed new glasses, but I haven't needed them for a long time. Can you recommend someone? I really just want to get this card and get back to work. This is a pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Here’s a list of optometrists in the area who accept Medicare. I recommend calling to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Once you have the results of your vision exam, you’ll need to bring them back to me. Unfortunately, we can’t continue the DOT physical without that information. I apologize for the inconvenience. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t think so. Just… when I bring that back, will you be able to do the rest of the exam right away? I don’t want to have to make another appointment. And how long will this whole thing take, once I have the eye exam results? I really need to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, if everything else is normal, once I have the results from the eye exam, we can complete the remaining parts of the physical right away, assuming I’m available. I would recommend calling ahead to schedule an appointment just to ensure I have time to review the results and perform the exam. As for how long it will take… assuming the eye exam results are satisfactory, the remaining exam shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. Then, I will complete the necessary paperwork. Overall, it should be fairly quick. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. It’s just… frustrating, having to go to another doctor. But I guess I don’t have a choice. Thank you for your help, Doctor. I’ll call the eye doctor tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you once you have the eye exam results.
