DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's this… weakness in my legs. It came on suddenly, after I had a really nasty cold. Not the flu, a cold. It’s just… inconvenient, honestly. I like to get things done, you know? And I can't really do much when my legs feel like jelly.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a sudden onset of weakness after a cold. "Inconvenient" isn't usually how I hear patients describe neurological symptoms, but I understand you're frustrated. Can you describe the weakness more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, I just… I don't like to make a fuss, Doctor. But yes, alright. It's… both legs, equally. It's not pain, exactly. More like… heavy? Like trying to lift weights I shouldn't be lifting. And it’s worse when I try to walk any distance. I have to stop and rest. It’s just… limiting. I used to walk everywhere. Now, it's a struggle to get to the mailbox. It feels… unstable, too. Like I might fall. Honestly, it's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Heavy," unstable, and limiting, worse with distance. And it started immediately after the cold resolved?
PATIENT: Yes, immediately. I felt a little run-down for a couple of days after the worst of the sneezing and coughing stopped, but then… bam. The legs just felt like… not mine. I thought it would get better on its own, you know? I don’t usually bother doctors with… things that might just go away. But it hasn’t. And frankly, I have a trip planned. I’m supposed to be visiting my sister in Florida next week. I can’t go to Florida like this.
DOCTOR: Right, a planned trip. We need to figure out what’s going on so we can determine if that trip is advisable. Let's go through some more detailed questions. First, when you say "immediately," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. The worst of the cold was, oh, probably last Tuesday, Wednesday. So, Thursday I was starting to feel a bit better, not 100%, but definitely on the mend. And by Friday… that’s when I noticed it. I went to the grocery store, just a quick trip, and about halfway through, my legs just… gave way a little. Not a full fall, thankfully, but enough to make me grab a cart. It's been downhill since then. It hasn’t gotten worse dramatically, but it hasn't improved at all. Honestly, it's rather annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. So roughly a week now. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: No. No other symptoms. No numbness, no tingling, no pain—aside from a little ache from using my legs so much trying to keep myself upright, of course. No fever, no dizziness, no changes in my bladder or bowels, nothing like that. Just… the legs. And frankly, I don’t understand why it would be the legs. A cold is a cold. It's not supposed to… do this. I mean, my niece had the flu last year and she had a headache and a cough. Simple. This is just… peculiar.
DOCTOR: Right, no associated symptoms, which is… unusual. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… let's see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control for years now with medication. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago. Other than that… no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, if a bit… particular about what I eat and how much I exercise. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. Honestly, I find most of them just want to give you pills for everything. It's more trouble than it’s worth, usually. I prefer to just let things… resolve on their own.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think... It’s… lisinopril, I think? Yes, lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And… that's it. Just the lisinopril. I've been taking it for… oh, goodness, must be eight years now. Doctor Ramirez prescribed it. She retired last year, which is probably for the best. She was a bit… overly cautious, if you know what I mean. Always wanting to run tests for everything. Honestly, I only continue taking it because my daughter insists. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril ten milligrams daily. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. I eat everything, I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to garden quite a bit, you know, and I never bothered with gloves. My hands are a bit rough, but no allergies. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies far too much these days. It's all… very dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay. No allergies. And have you ever had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. And… I had a wisdom tooth pulled when I was young, but that hardly counts as a surgery, does it? It was a very quick procedure. No complications. Honestly, I’ve always been lucky in that regard. I heal very quickly, I suppose. I’m generally quite… robust. I don't understand why my legs are doing this. It’s just… inconvenient, really. And quite embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no further surgeries. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well... my mother had diabetes, type 2, but she lived a long life, into her eighties. My father... he had heart problems, I think. Not sure exactly what, it was a long time ago. And... my brother has high cholesterol, but he doesn’t really take care of himself. He eats terribly and doesn’t exercise. Honestly, I think that’s just a matter of willpower. And… that’s about it, really. No one else in my family has ever had anything serious. We're generally a healthy bunch. Except for my brother, of course. He insists on making bad choices. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with type 2 diabetes, father with heart problems, and a brother with high cholesterol. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. None of that. I wouldn't dream of it. I find it all… rather distasteful, frankly. I have always been very careful about what I put into my body. I eat a healthy diet, I exercise regularly, and I get plenty of sleep. I take pride in my good health. And I certainly wouldn't jeopardize it with… those sorts of things. Honestly, I think people who smoke and drink are making very poor choices. It’s… irresponsible. And frankly, it smells terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, regarding your lifestyle, what is your typical daily activity level like?
PATIENT: Well, before this, I was quite active. I used to walk at least a mile every day, sometimes more. I did gardening, of course. I ran errands, I went to the grocery store, I visited friends. I like to keep busy. I’m not one for sitting around doing nothing. But now… it's quite different. I have to take things very slowly. I get tired very easily. I have to rest frequently. I can't walk very far without having to stop. It's… frustrating, to say the least. I miss being able to do things without having to worry about my legs giving out. Honestly, it’s ruining my routine. And it’s very… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, significantly decreased activity due to leg weakness. Let me just quickly review this information. You're a 44-year-old female, with a history of controlled hypertension, no known allergies, family history of diabetes and heart problems, and a recent onset of bilateral leg weakness following a cold. You’ve described the weakness as heavy and unstable, and it’s limiting your daily activities. Now, I'm going to need to do a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just… please be gentle. And don't take too long. I have things to do, you know. I'm sure it’s nothing serious. Probably just a pulled muscle or something. Honestly, I don’t understand why I even had to come in for this. But my daughter insisted. She always does. Just… be quick, please. And try not to make a fuss. I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, I’m going to examine your legs. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation. Please relax. Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, alright. Is that enough? I have fairly strong hands, you know. I do a lot of gardening. And… I do try to keep myself in shape. It's important to stay active, even when one is getting older. Honestly, I don’t understand why I’m being tested like this. It’s just… weakness. It's not rocket science.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s sufficient. Your grip strength appears normal bilaterally. Now, can you lift your legs against my resistance?
PATIENT: It’s a little difficult, you know. They feel… heavy. Like I’m lifting weights. Honestly, this is quite tiring. I’m not sure what you’re trying to find, but I can assure you, there’s nothing seriously wrong with my legs. It's just… a temporary weakness. It'll pass. It always does. Honestly, I think I could be much more productive if you just let me go. I have errands to run, you know. And dinner to prepare. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There is some weakness present in both legs, particularly with dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the feet. I'm also going to assess your gait. Can you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It’s not very graceful, I’ll admit. It's hard to walk normally when one’s legs feel like jelly. Honestly, I feel rather foolish being made to waddle around like this. It’s not a dignified sight, you know. And frankly, it’s making my condition worse. The more I walk, the more tired my legs become. Honestly, I think this examination is counterproductive. I should just go home and rest. It's the best thing to do, you know. It's what my mother always did. She said worrying about things only makes them worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Your gait is slightly unsteady with a mild shuffling quality. Now, I'm going to perform a brief neurological exam, just to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to test your reflexes again, and also check your sensation in your feet. Your reflexes are still 2+ bilaterally, and sensation is intact. However, I do note some mild decreased strength in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, as I mentioned before. Based on my examination, and your recent history, I suspect this might be a case of post-viral neuropathy. It's inflammation of the nerves, often following a viral infection. It can cause weakness, but usually resolves on its own with time. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function tests. I also want to order an electromyography and nerve conduction study, or EMG/NCS, to assess the function of your nerves more precisely.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Electromyography? Honestly, Doctor, you’re scaring me now. I just have a bit of weakness in my legs. It’s not… something complicated, is it? I don't want any invasive tests. And I certainly don’t want any medications. Honestly, I've always been perfectly healthy. I’ve never needed any fancy tests or pills. I just want to go home. Is there… anything else? Honestly, all this talk about nerves and inflammation is very unsettling. I think I need a glass of water. And a lie-down. Is it absolutely necessary to have all these tests? Perhaps I just need some rest. It always works. Honestly, I don’t understand why you can’t just tell me it’s nothing serious. It's very frustrating, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. I want to reassure you that we're simply being thorough. While post-viral neuropathy is the most likely explanation, it’s important to rule out other, less common causes of weakness. The blood work is routine and will help us assess your overall health. The EMG/NCS is a more specialized test that will allow us to pinpoint the source of the nerve issue and ensure an accurate diagnosis. It is not invasive, involving small electrodes placed on the skin. It allows us to determine the severity of the condition. I will order the tests now. You can schedule them at the front desk. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs, avoiding strenuous activity, and staying well-hydrated. I will also write a prescription for a multivitamin, just to ensure you are getting all the necessary nutrients. I would like to see you back in two weeks to review the results and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Honestly, that seems like a very long time to wait. And a multivitamin? Is that all? I was hoping for a more… definitive answer. Or at least some sort of treatment. I have a trip planned, you know. Next week. I need to know if I can go. Honestly, this is very inconvenient. And I really don’t want to have to cancel. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps some exercises? Or some sort of cream? I don’t want to just sit around and wait for two weeks. It’s… unproductive. And frankly, it’s making me very anxious. Honestly, I'm not sure I trust this diagnosis. It sounds… complicated. Is there another doctor I could see? Someone who might have a quicker answer? This is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your anxiety and your desire for a quick resolution. However, a proper diagnosis requires time and thorough investigation. Rushing into a treatment plan without knowing the underlying cause could be detrimental. While I appreciate your concern, I do not recommend seeking a second opinion at this time. I am confident in my assessment, and I believe that the tests I have ordered will provide us with the information we need to develop an effective treatment plan. Regarding exercises, I recommend gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises to maintain flexibility and prevent stiffness. However, avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. As for creams, there are no topical treatments for neuropathy. I will write a note for a physical therapist referral, should you wish to pursue that option after the test results. They can teach you specific exercises to improve your strength and function. In the meantime, please rest your legs, stay hydrated, and avoid any activities that worsen your symptoms. I cannot definitively say whether you can go on your trip next week until we have the test results. However, I recommend consulting with your sister and discussing the potential risks and benefits of traveling in your current condition. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe pain, numbness, or weakness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Severe pain? Numbness? Honestly, Doctor, you're scaring me again! I just have a bit of weakness. A bit! It’s hardly a medical emergency. Fine. I'll rest. I'll drink water. I’ll avoid strenuous activity. I’ll talk to my sister. I’ll get the tests. But honestly, I still think this is all very… excessive. And I expect a detailed explanation of the results. I don't want any vague answers or complicated jargon. I want to understand what’s going on. And I want a plan. A clear, concise plan. I don't have time for endless tests and ambiguous diagnoses. I have things to do, you know. And a trip to plan. Honestly, this whole experience has been… very frustrating. And I really hope the results are negative. Otherwise, I don't know what I'm going to do. Alright. I think that's enough for today. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I'll schedule the tests at the front desk.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Firestone. I will contact you as soon as the test results are available. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your condition.
