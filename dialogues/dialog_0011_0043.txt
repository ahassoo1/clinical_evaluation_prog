DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 84 years young. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Neppl. Nice to meet you as well. Eighty-four, that's right. Seems like yesterday I was a young man, honestly. Well, what brings me in… it's this headache I've been getting. Right in the back of my head. It's been bothering me for… oh, let me think… about a week now, maybe a little longer. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: I understand. A headache for approximately a week, intermittent in nature, located at the back of your head. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Hmm, how to describe it… it’s not a throbbing pain, you know? More of a… a dull ache. Like a weight sitting there. Sometimes it feels tight, like a band around my head, but mostly just… achy. It doesn’t make me sick to my stomach or anything, and I can still see just fine. Just… uncomfortable. And it seems worse when I’ve been sitting for a long time, reading or watching TV. Though, it’s been there even when I’m out walking too, just… less noticeable. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Gibbel. A dull, achy sensation, sometimes feeling like a tightness or band around the head, not associated with nausea or visual disturbances. It seems to be somewhat aggravated by prolonged sitting, but present even with activity. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… Now, my memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll try. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. Not like falling-down exhausted, just… needing a nap in the afternoon sometimes. And my appetite hasn’t been huge, but I’m eating… not as much as I usually do. Oh! And my hands… they feel a little stiff in the mornings, especially. But I figured that’s just old age catching up with me, you know? It’s not painful, just… less flexible than they used to be. Is that the sort of thing you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That's very good information, Mr. Gibbel. Increased fatigue, decreased appetite, and morning stiffness in your hands. These are all important details. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision lately, besides not experiencing any disturbances with the headache?
PATIENT: No, my vision’s been… pretty steady, I think. I had my eyes checked maybe two years ago, and they said I just needed stronger glasses, which I got. I still see a little blurry up close, that's why I'm always fiddling with these spectacles, , but that's been the same for years. No floaters, no double vision, nothing like that. Just the usual getting older eyesight. Everything still looks pretty clear when I'm looking at things far away, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Gibbel. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, medical history… let me think. Years ago, maybe thirty years or so, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. They put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the way they made me feel. And I had a bad knee for a while, needed a cortisone shot, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… not much, really. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Never been a hospital man, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a history of elevated blood pressure in the past, treated with medication that you discontinued, and a knee issue requiring a cortisone injection. And otherwise, generally good health. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been under the knife, thankfully. My mother always said I was too stubborn to let anyone cut on me. She was probably right. Just a few fillings in my teeth over the years, that's about it. Nothing major, nothing that required a hospital stay. I always try to take good care of myself, you know? Brush my teeth, eat my vegetables… mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Gibbel. It sounds like you’ve been very proactive about your health. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tricky one. My parents are both gone now, and I don’t have any siblings. My mother, she had arthritis, bad in her hands and knees. That's probably where I get the stiffness. And my father… he had some heart trouble when he got older, but I don’t know exactly what kind. He didn't go to the doctor much, didn't believe in it. As for my grandparents… I didn’t know them very well. They lived far away, and we didn't visit often. So, I don't really know much about their medical history. Does that help? It’s hard to remember everything, you know. Especially when it’s so long ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Gibbel. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing your mother had arthritis and your father had heart trouble is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m retired now, used to be a financial advisor, helped people plan for their future. Mostly just take it easy these days. I live alone in a small house. I like to read a lot, mostly history books. And I watch TV, of course. I try to walk every day, when the weather is nice. Nothing too strenuous, just a gentle stroll around the neighborhood. I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I used to be more active, played a little golf when I was younger, but my knee doesn't allow for that anymore. Mostly just trying to keep my mind and body active, you know? It's important to stay busy. And I have a few friends I see every now and then, go out to lunch or play cards. Nothing too wild. A quiet life, but it suits me just fine.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable lifestyle, Mr. Gibbel. Staying mentally and physically active is excellent. Now, one final question regarding your history: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been lucky that way too. I can eat anything, take most pills without any problems. I’ve had a few mosquito bites over the years, but that’s about it. I'm not allergic to anything that I’m aware of. So, no, no allergies to report. I think that’s everything, Doctor. Hopefully, I haven’t bored you to death with all my rambling!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Gibbel. You’ve given me a very thorough history, and I appreciate you taking the time to share it with me. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be causing your headache. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy or thyroid enlargement detected. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, no problem. There you go, moving it slowly… and now a little faster… all right. I think I'm following it just fine. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, but I can see your finger pretty clearly. I hope I'm not missing it!
DOCTOR: Excellent. No nystagmus or deficits in extraocular movements noted. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Is that tight enough? I'm trying my best. I used to have pretty strong hands, working with numbers and paperwork all day, but they're not as strong as they used to be. Still, I can squeeze pretty hard. Let me know if you want me to squeeze harder, or if that's enough.
DOCTOR: Good strength bilaterally, 5/5 in both hands. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, symmetrical. Finally, I'm going to quickly assess your gait. Would you mind standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, no problem. A little wobbly, if you don't mind. My balance isn't what it used to be either. There you go, one step, two steps… a little careful now… trying to keep my balance… and that’s a few steps. How am I doing?
DOCTOR: Good. Gait is slightly slow but steady, no significant abnormalities detected. Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Based on the history and physical examination, your headache appears to be tension-type. The intermittent nature, location, and lack of neurological deficits are consistent with that diagnosis. The fatigue, decreased appetite, and morning stiffness could be related to age or a mild underlying condition, but are not immediately concerning. However, given your age and the recent onset of symptoms, I would like to order a few blood tests to rule out any other potential causes. These will include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin D level. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea, just to be safe. I'd rather know for sure than worry about it. So, yes, I'm agreeable to that. Whatever you think is best. Where do we go from here? Do I need to make another appointment? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have a requisition for you, and the nurse will draw the blood. It usually takes about 3-5 business days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief as needed – either ibuprofen or acetaminophen, following the instructions on the label. Also, try to maintain good hydration, manage stress, and ensure adequate sleep. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of the blood tests. Does next Tuesday at 10:00 AM work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, next Tuesday at 10:00 AM sounds perfect. I can definitely make that work. Thank you, Doctor. So, just over-the-counter pain relief, stay hydrated, manage stress… easier said than done, but I’ll try my best. And then we'll discuss the blood tests next week. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or any warning signs I should be looking out for? I don’t want to ignore anything that might be serious.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Gibbel. It's important to be proactive. If you experience any of the following, please seek immediate medical attention: Sudden, severe headache unlike any you've experienced before. Fever, stiff neck, or confusion. Weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. Vision changes, such as double vision or loss of vision. Seizures. Otherwise, we'll focus on managing your symptoms and addressing the blood test results next week. Here is the lab requisition, and the nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered everything I’ve asked, and explained everything very clearly. Sudden severe headache, fever, stiff neck, weakness… I’ll keep an eye out for those. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me and run some tests. It puts my mind at ease just knowing we’re looking into it. I appreciate your kindness and patience. Now, I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a good day as well. And please, take care.
PATIENT: .
