DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, to be frank, I’m not really one for… explaining things. But my wife – well, was my wife – she kept on about needing to be “optimized”. Said it was important. Something about sleep and… getting fitter. So here I am. Medicare sent me, so… let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Redfern. “Optimized” can certainly mean different things to different people. We’ll proceed at your pace. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… hmm. It comes and goes, I suppose. I used to… well, never mind. I sleep. In a bed. For roughly… some hours. I wouldn’t say it’s refreshing. Is that what you want to know? Look, I don’t really track these things. I fix instruments, not myself. Do I snore? I have no idea. My wife would complain about… things. But honestly, I blocked most of that out. It was a stressful time.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. We can work with what you do remember, or how things are now. You mentioned your wife complained about “things” – can you recall anything specific about those complaints?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics… Why does it matter what she complained about? She was a worrier. Always fussing. Let me think… She said I… moved a lot. Restless legs, I think she called it. And sometimes… she’d nudge me, say I wasn’t breathing right. That was… unpleasant for both of us. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur now. It wasn’t like I was trying to bother her. It just… happened. Is she here to… verify all this? Because that’s just… not gonna work.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Redfern, your wife isn’t here. We’re simply gathering information to understand what might be going on. Restless legs and concerns about your breathing during sleep are helpful details. To clarify, would you describe these breathing pauses as loud snoring, gasping for air, or something else?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember specifics! It was… sounds. Like a choking noise, maybe? And sometimes a wheeze. She’d poke me to wake me up. Then I'd be all groggy and disoriented. It wasn’t pleasant. I don’t think it was just snoring. Snoring is… normal, isn’t it? This was… worse. More dramatic. She'd get really upset. Honestly, it’s a relief not to have to deal with that anymore. Does that help? I really just want to get this over with and go back to my workshop. Instruments are much more… predictable.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Redfern, that is very helpful. It sounds like you may have been experiencing something more than simple snoring. Would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs and heart?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Get it over with. I’ve had doctors poke and prod before. It’s not my favorite activity, but I suppose it’s necessary. Just… try not to take too long. I’ve got a viola that needs a new soundpost. It’s a very delicate piece of work. And honestly, the thought of spending all day here is… not appealing. Just get on with it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. I’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll get started. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 148 over 92. Your heart rate is normal, and your lungs sound relatively clear, though I did hear a slight wheeze. I’m also noting some enlargement of your thyroid gland when I palpate your neck. Do you have any history of thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Thyroid… problems? No. Never. I don't even know what a thyroid is, really. I fix instruments, not… people's insides. Is that… bad? She always went to the doctor. Got all sorts of tests done. She'd tell me about… things. But I mostly tuned her out. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to medical jargon. Is this something serious? Because if it is, I really need to get back to my workshop. That viola is waiting. And the owner is… particular.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Redfern. A slight enlargement of the thyroid is relatively common and doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your thyroid hormone levels. This will also help us understand if the mild wheezing I heard is related. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Ugh. Fine. But can we keep it brief? I really don't like needles. And I don't want a lot of waiting around. I have a shop to run. A living to make. Instruments don’t fix themselves, you know. And the sooner I get this done, the sooner I can go back to a sensible life. Just… tell me where to go, and I’ll get it over with. And make sure they don’t take a gallon of blood, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. It will be a standard blood draw, just a few vials. The lab is just down the hall, room 3B. I'll write an order for you, and they’ll take excellent care of you. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Here you go. Once you’ve had the blood draw, the results will be sent to me, and I’ll review them and contact you to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… No. I’m fine. Just… instruments. And needles. Alright, 15-20 minutes, you said? And then I can go? Wonderful. No, I think that's all. Honestly, the less medical talk, the better. Thank you. I’ll just… go do this thing.
