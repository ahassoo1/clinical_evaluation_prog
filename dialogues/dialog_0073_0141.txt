DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s just… this itching. Everywhere, really. It started, oh, I don’t know… a couple of weeks ago, maybe? It's just driving me nuts. It's not like a rash, not really. Just… itchy skin. All over.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Itching, you say. And it’s been going on for a couple of weeks, all over your body. Is it worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: No, not really. It seems pretty constant, to be honest. Maybe a little worse before bed, now that I think about it. But not much. I haven't noticed it getting worse after doing anything specific… gardening, cleaning, doesn’t seem to matter. It just… is. It’s more annoying than painful, but it keeps me up sometimes. I scratch a lot, I guess. Old habit, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant itching for a couple of weeks… and you’ve noticed it’s slightly worse at night. And you said you scratch at it… have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itching?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve seen. It just looks… normal, I guess. A little red from all the scratching, naturally. But no bumps, blisters, dryness… nothing like that. I check myself pretty regularly, you know? Always have. Just the itching. It’s very… persistent.
DOCTOR: Alright. No visible rash, just redness from scratching. Persistent itching… Have you tried anything over the counter to alleviate it?
PATIENT: Yes, I did. I tried some of that lotion, you know, the one for itchy skin? And some calamine lotion. Didn’t really do much, honestly. Calamine lotion felt… sticky. The other lotion just didn’t seem to help for very long. That's why I figured I should come in. It's just not letting up.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you haven't recently started using any new soaps, detergents, or lotions that you can recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. I’ve been using the same stuff for… well, a long time. Old spice soap, and a basic laundry detergent. Nothing fancy. I'm not one for trying new things, usually. Oh! Wait a minute... my daughter, she brought me a new hand cream. Lavender scented, I think. I used that a couple of times, maybe a week or so ago. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Lavender scented hand cream… interesting. Do you still have it?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It's right here in my bag. It was a gift, she thought I needed something for my dry hands in the winter. It smelled… nice, I suppose. Not my usual thing, though.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It does contain a number of fragrance components. It’s possible that you’re experiencing a contact dermatitis from one of these. Alright, let’s do a quick examination of your skin. If you don't mind, I'll just take a look at a few areas.
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want this itching to stop. I'm happy to show you anything you need to see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your skin looks generally normal, no obvious signs of rash or excema. Some mild redness on your forearms, consistent with scratching. Let me take a look at your back and abdomen… It's pretty uniform, all over. No specific areas of concern. Not a classic presentation of anything, really. A bit… diffuse.
PATIENT: Alright. That's good to know, I guess. Diffuse… what does that mean, exactly? Is that… bad? It just feels so… everywhere. It's hard to explain. I'm a simple man, you know? Not much bothers me, usually. But this… this is wearing me down.
DOCTOR: “Diffuse” simply means it’s widespread, not localized to one area. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, but it does make it a little more difficult to pinpoint the cause. Given the lack of a clear rash, and the widespread nature of the itching, it could be a number of things. We’ll need to consider a few possibilities. Now, do you have any allergies that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. I mean, I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything that I’ve noticed. Dust, maybe? I sneeze a little in the spring, but that’s about it. No food allergies, no reactions to medications… I’m pretty lucky, in that regard. I wish I knew what was causing this, though. It's just frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Given your symptoms – the widespread itching, the lack of a rash, and the absence of any obvious triggers – it could be a case of idiopathic pruritus. That simply means itching with no identifiable cause. It’s more common in people your age. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay. Idiopathic… that’s a mouthful. No identifiable cause… so, it just happens? Blood work… that sounds… sensible, I suppose. I don’t mind that at all. Just tell me what I need to do, Doctor. And what happens if… if it is just idiopathic? Is there anything I can do for it? I’m just trying to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It means we haven't found an underlying medical cause yet, yes. It's not uncommon, and doesn't necessarily mean something serious is going on. The blood work will help us rule out things like liver problems, kidney disease, and thyroid issues – all of which can sometimes cause itching. If the results come back normal, then we’d likely consider it idiopathic pruritus. If that’s the case, treatment focuses on symptom management. We can try antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, and emollients to soothe the skin. There are also some newer medications that can sometimes help, but we’ll cross that bridge if we need to. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood now. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Symptom management… that sounds… reasonable. I’ve always been one to just deal with things, you know? Blood work sounds good. Let’s get that done. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Where to now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Excellent. The lab technician is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll take care of you. After the blood work, you can come back, and we’ll discuss the results when they're available, likely in a couple of days. In the meantime, you can continue to use over-the-counter antihistamines if they provide any relief. And avoid any products with fragrances, just in case. Do you need a written order for the blood work, or can they access it electronically through Medicare?
PATIENT: Medicare should be fine electronically, I think. My daughter helps me with all that. She's very good with computers. She’ll know what to do. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll go find the lab now.
