DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Finco. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit… embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having to go to the restroom rather frequently lately. It’s become quite disruptive, really. I don't really recall when it started, just that it's… more often than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. That can be caused by a number of things, so it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… it’s not painful, thankfully. Just… the urge comes on quite suddenly, and I have to go, almost immediately. It's happened several times during the day, and… sometimes I wake up in the night needing to go as well. I don't recall drinking more water than usual, but perhaps I have? It's difficult to say. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. It’s perfectly alright. Memory can be tricky. And it's good to hear there isn’t any pain. So, frequent urination, both day and night, without pain. Do you notice any difference in how much urine you're passing each time?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I believe… no, not really. It seems like a normal amount each time. Not particularly large volumes, nor smaller than usual. It just feels like I’m going more often. It's frustrating, more than anything. I used to be able to go several hours without needing to visit the restroom. Now… it's a constant consideration.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination, normal volume, both day and night. No pain. Hmm. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I was divorced several years ago, and… my medical records weren’t easily transferred, and frankly, I haven’t kept them up to date. I don't recall any major illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. I do have a bit of a family history of… well, my grandmother had something with her kidneys, I believe. But I don’t have the specifics, and I wasn’t particularly close to her. I apologize again for being so unhelpful. I wish I could provide more information.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize, Keoni. These things happen. It's perfectly alright. Family history of kidney issues is good to know, even without details. And no major illnesses or surgeries is helpful as well. Let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything right now?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven’t needed to take any medication for quite some time. I haven’t been prescribed anything recently, and I don’t take any over-the-counter remedies regularly. Just… vitamins occasionally, when I remember. Nothing consistent. I'm not insured, so I try to avoid needing to visit the doctor whenever possible, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Keoni. I understand. No current medications, occasional vitamins. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just a basic check, including listening to your abdomen, and a quick neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. A neurological assessment? Is that standard for something like this? I confess, I’m a bit unsure what that entails, but I’m happy to proceed.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of a general assessment, Keoni. We just want to rule out any underlying neurological factors that could be contributing. It’s very straightforward – checking your reflexes, balance, and a few other simple things. If you’d be comfortable, please have a seat on the table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, take your time. I do hope this isn’t anything too serious. I have a rather important appointment next week, and I’d hate to have to cancel it.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Balance is slightly unsteady, but not significantly concerning. Everything appears to be within normal limits, Keoni, but the slight unsteadiness and frequent urination together warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. The urinalysis will check for any signs of infection or other abnormalities in your urine, and the metabolic panel will assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels.
PATIENT: A urinalysis and a metabolic panel… that sounds sensible. Will those be expensive, Doctor? I confess, finances are rather tight at the moment. I hadn’t anticipated needing such tests. Is there any way to… minimize the cost, perhaps?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Keoni, and I understand your concern. I’ll see what I can do to minimize the cost. We can often get a discounted rate for patients without insurance, and I can also help you find a local lab that offers more affordable testing. Let me see… there’s a lab just a few blocks away that offers a significantly lower rate for a basic urinalysis and metabolic panel. It’s approximately $75 for both tests, which is the best I can find in the area. Would that be manageable for you?
PATIENT: $75… yes, that is manageable. Thank you, Doctor Finco. I truly appreciate you looking into that for me. It's a great weight off my mind. And what about the tests themselves? How long will they take, and what do I need to do to prepare? I don’t want to inadvertently do something that will affect the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Keoni. I'm glad we could find a more affordable option. The tests are quite simple. For the urinalysis, you’ll just need to provide a urine sample – they’ll give you a sterile cup at the lab. It’s best to collect a mid-stream sample, meaning you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream in the cup. They’ll give you detailed instructions on how to do that. For the metabolic panel, you’ll need to have a blood draw. It's best to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks other than water. That will ensure the most accurate results. The tests themselves should only take about 15-20 minutes each, but plan on about an hour total, including check-in and paperwork. They’ll send the results to me directly, usually within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to discuss the findings and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. No food or drinks for 8-12 hours, mid-stream urine sample… I think I can manage that. I'll make sure to schedule the tests first thing in the morning. And if… if the results are not good, what would the next step be? I don't mean to be morbid, but I prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible question, Keoni. It's always best to be prepared. The next step depends entirely on the results, of course. If the urinalysis shows signs of infection, we would likely prescribe antibiotics. If the metabolic panel shows any kidney abnormalities, we might need to do further testing – like an ultrasound or a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s entirely possible that the results will be normal, or that any abnormalities are minor and easily treatable. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, alright?
PATIENT: You're right, of course. No point in worrying prematurely. Thank you, Doctor Finco. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I feel much more reassured now. Is there anything else I should know before I leave? Or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Keoni. I’m glad I could help. There’s no additional paperwork for now. I’ll give you a card with the lab’s address and phone number, as well as my direct line. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And, one last thing – please drink plenty of fluids over the next few days, even while you're fasting. Staying hydrated is important. Otherwise, you're all set. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I will be sure to drink plenty of water and I will call if I have any questions. Have a good day, and thank you for your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Keoni. You have a good day as well. Please take care.
