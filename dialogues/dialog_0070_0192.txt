DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first. Seems like a lot of bother, honestly. But they said I have to.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A pre-employment or routine military examination. Perfectly reasonable. They are quite thorough, as they should be. Well, we'll get everything taken care of for you. To begin, could you tell me a little more about what specifically the military is requiring you to be evaluated for?
PATIENT: Evaluated for? What do you mean? They just said “exam.” A full physical, I think. You know, height, weight, can I see, can I hear… the usual. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to details like that. I just want to get it over with so I can go. It’s a good opportunity, you know? Not everyone gets a chance like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your eagerness, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like a comprehensive physical examination is what’s needed. No problem at all; we can certainly do that. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you’ve had any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted this examination, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Concerns? Look, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I’ve always been strong, always been healthy. I work with machines all day, you know? Keeps you in shape. Lifting, bending, fixing… no time to be sick. I don't have symptoms. They just want to make sure I’m… what, up to standard? That’s all.
DOCTOR: Very good. It's excellent that you're feeling well and staying active. Just to be thorough, and to cover all bases for the military’s requirements, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it was years ago?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. Never. Not a thing. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up just fine. Other than that… nothing. I told you, I’m healthy. Strong as an ox. My wife always says I worry too much about other people being sick, not myself. She’s the one who’s always getting colds, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital visits. Not even for the arm. My mother wanted me to go, said it needed a proper look. But I just put a cast on it myself, good as new. Always been able to fix things. Didn’t need a doctor then, and haven’t needed one since.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s… resourceful. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What do you want to know? My father was a builder, strong man. Lived to be eighty. Mother was… well, she worried a lot. She had… I don't know, something with her heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. My brother is fine, works in an office. Boring. No health problems that I know of. Honestly, we don’t talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Makes you weak. I eat good food, get enough sleep… that’s all you need. My wife takes something for her… her nerves, I think. But I stay away from all that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Just a few more quick questions, then we can move on to a brief physical examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I can eat anything, do anything. Never had a problem. I’ve even handled wasps nests, pulled ‘em down myself. My wife nearly had a heart attack, but I was fine. Strong immune system, you know?
DOCTOR: Very good. That's excellent. Now, to complete the assessment for the military examination, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. This will include checking your height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I told you, I'm healthy. It'll just be a waste of time, but if they need it, they need it. Just don’t take too long. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. Let’s start with your height and weight. If you could step onto the scale, please. Your blood pressure and pulse are within normal limits. Now, if you'll just remove your shirt, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But hurry up. It’s a bit chilly in here. And don’t go poking around too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Breathing is normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Everything seems to be within normal limits, physically. Given your reported history and physical exam findings, you appear to be in good health. However, given your low weight for your height—a BMI of approximately 15.3—I do recommend a follow-up with a nutritionist to ensure you are maintaining adequate nutrition. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Nutritionist? What for? I eat plenty. Steak, potatoes, bread… everything I need. This is ridiculous. They’re going to make me see a nutritionist? Look, I'm a strong, healthy man. I don't need a nutritionist. This is just a waste of my time. And frankly, a bit insulting. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration. My recommendation isn't to imply you aren't healthy, but rather to ensure you are maintaining optimal nutritional status for your body type and activity level. A low BMI can sometimes indicate underlying issues, and a nutritionist can help ensure you’re meeting all your nutritional needs. However, I respect your decision. To fulfill the requirements of the military examination, I will document the physical exam findings and my recommendation for nutritional assessment. Do you have any further concerns or questions before we conclude?
