DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I'm here for this... exam. Military thing. Need to get it done. Don't really see why I need a doctor for it, but they said I gotta come. Seems like a waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like this is a required exam for your military service. While it might feel like an extra step, these exams are important to ensure you're in good health and fit for duty. We want to make sure everything is as it should be. To start, can you tell me a little more about what kind of exam it is, specifically?
PATIENT: Specifics? Uh... they just said "pre-recruitment". Like, before I get recruited. I mostly just do stuff with engines, you know? Cars, boats, some farm equipment. Not like I'm running marathons or anything. They didn't tell me what they're looking for, exactly. Just that I needed to come here and... get checked. Seems kinda silly, if you ask me. Most fellas are tougher than they look.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It can be annoying when things aren't clearly explained. “Pre-recruitment” exams are fairly standard. They cover a broad range of things to get a baseline of your overall health. It's not about assuming anything is wrong, it’s about having a complete picture. So, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Plenty. Working with engines isn't exactly a safe job. Cuts, burns, sprains… you name it. Nothing major. Broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while fixing a tractor. Healed alright, though. Had a bad flu a couple winters ago, knocked me off my feet for a week. Other than that... not much. I'm a pretty sturdy guy. Don’t get sick often. No serious illnesses, no hospital stays. Wife keeps telling me to see a doctor more, but I tell her I'm fine. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a wrist fracture and a bout of the flu. Good to know. And I appreciate you mentioning your wife’s concern – it’s always good to have someone looking out for you. Now, just to clarify, when you say “healed alright” with the wrist, do you have any lingering pain, stiffness, or limited range of motion in that wrist now?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. It clicks a bit sometimes when it's cold, you know? Like a little pop. But it doesn’t hurt. I can grip things just fine. Lift stuff, turn wrenches… everything works. It’s been years, so you forget about it after a while. It’s just… there. Doesn't bother me none. Wife always asks if it's bothering me, she thinks I should get it looked at. But like I said, I’m fine. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a clicking sensation in the wrist with no pain or limitations. We can certainly document that. It's good you’re able to function normally. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I've always been lucky enough to avoid the knife. My old man always said, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” I kinda live by that. Seems sensible, doesn't it? No point messing with things that are working fine, even if they’re a little banged up. Surgeries are for folks who really need 'em, not someone who just has a few scrapes and bruises. Besides, I don’t like hospitals. Gives me the creeps.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible philosophy, Mr. Hartness. And I respect your preference to avoid unnecessary interventions. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My dad… he had a bad heart. Died when he was in his sixties, heart attack. Mom was alright, lived to be eighty-something, but she had high blood pressure, always complaining about it. Grandfather on my wife’s side… he had some kind of cancer, I think. Lung cancer, maybe? But that’s about it. Nothing really serious on my side. Mostly just folks who lived hard lives and wore themselves out. Tough stock, though. They didn't complain much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart disease in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and lung cancer in your wife's grandfather. That’s helpful information. Now, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched it. My dad smoked like a chimney, and he always coughed up a storm. Didn't want to end up like him. Always figured it was a bad habit. And the smell… awful. Wife doesn't like it either. She’d have my hide if I even thought about it. No, I don't smoke. Don't even like being around people who do.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer now and then. Maybe a couple on a Saturday night, watching the hockey game. Nothing more. I'm not a big drinker. Never really liked the taste of it much, to be honest. Just a social thing, really. Wife has a glass of wine sometimes too. We're not party animals or anything. Just… normal. I don’t need it to have a good time. Good company and a good game is enough for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption. That's good to know. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? What kind of question is that? No. Absolutely not. I've never touched that stuff, and I don't plan to start. Waste of time and money, if you ask me. And it's just… wrong. Never understood why people would do that to themselves. I work hard for my living, I don't need anything messing with my head. I’ve got a good life, a good wife, and a good job. Don’t need drugs to make it better. Frankly, I find the question a little insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question offended you, Mr. Hartness. I understand your reaction, and I assure you I wasn't trying to imply anything. I’m required to ask about these things as part of a comprehensive medical assessment. It’s simply a standard part of the process, and it helps me get a complete picture of your overall health. Now, to finish up the history portion, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I'm working with certain chemicals, but that's just from the grease and dirt. Nothing serious. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Just the occasional painkiller if I pull a muscle, but that’s about it. Nope, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Simple man, simple needs. Don’t need a lot to keep me going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, that completes the history portion of the exam. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general condition. Is that alright with you?
