DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Zicarelli, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pehrson. Thank you for seeing me. Well, lately I does be feeling very thirsty, all the time thirsty. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. Is not making sense, you know? I just… I does feel like I need more and more.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… right. And how long has this “more and more” been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I would say… maybe about a month now? A month or so. It start slow, just feeling a little bit more thirsty after work, you know, from the sun. But then it just keep getting worse and worse. And the hunger… that come after the thirst start, maybe two weeks after. Is just… worrying me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… well, I does feel a little tired, yes. More tired than usual, even after a good night sleep. And… sometimes I does have to go to the bathroom more often. Not bad, but more than before. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem a little… busy?
DOCTOR: Look, I have patients waiting, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. I’m sorry to bother you. I just… I wanted to make sure I tell you everything. Is it something serious, you think? I does worry easily, you know? My husband, he say I should come see you, but I didn't want to waste your time if it was nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's get a quick look at your vitals, then we'll go from there. Blood pressure, pulse… Nurse, can you get her weight and temperature, please?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I will just sit here quietly until the nurse come. Is my weight important? I does like my food, you know. Maybe I gain a little bit?
DOCTOR: Weight is important. We need a baseline. Just… sit still.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will sit still. Is just… I does get nervous when I go to the doctor. My mother always say I was a fussy baby. Is that alright if I ask what you looking for with the weight? Is it something bad? I just want to understand, you know?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Zicarelli. We’re checking basic things. It could be anything. It could be nothing. Let's get the nurse in here so we can move this along, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright, Doctor. I understand. I’m sorry to be a bother. I will just… wait here quietly then. Is just, I’m not good with not knowing what’s happening, you know? I get worried. But you are the doctor, so I trust you. Just tell me when you need me to do something.
DOCTOR: Just… try to relax. We'll get through this. Nurse! Where is that nurse?
PATIENT: I does be trying, Doctor. I really does. Is just… hard to relax when you don’t know what’s going on. But I will try my best. Maybe I should tell you about my garden? Is blooming lovely right now, with all the rain we been having. But maybe that's not important right now, yes? .
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Nurse, vitals are in. Blood pressure 140/90, pulse 88, weight 78 kilograms. Temperature normal. Look, Ms. Zicarelli, with your weight and blood pressure, and the thirst and frequent urination… we need to rule out diabetes. I'm going to order some blood work. Fasting glucose and A1C. Do you have any known allergies?
