DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban, good to see you. Though frankly, I have a rather full schedule today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor Ruocco. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts. Medicare sent me. It is… a requirement, yes? I do not really understand all of this paperwork, but they said I need to be examined.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the Medicare physical. A lot of… unnecessary bureaucracy, if you ask me. Still. A requirement is a requirement. So, you're generally healthy, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Generally healthy, yes. I work very hard. Food processing… it is physical work. I lift things, I stand a lot. I do not… sit around. I have not been sick sick, you understand? No big problems. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who is not?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Physical labor. That's… something. Okay. Any specific complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? No. Not really. My back… sometimes aches, after a long day. But I am not old. It is just… muscles. I rub it with… a cream. It is fine. I do not need a doctor for muscles, no?
DOCTOR: No, probably not. But Medicare wants me to ask. Any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. My hands, maybe… a little sore from the work. But it goes away when I rest. It is normal, yes? Everyone’s hands hurt after working with food all day. You understand. It is… not a big deal. I do not complain easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about… any issues with your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I breathe fine. Always have. I do not… get out of breath walking up stairs, or anything like that. I do not smoke. I do not have… the cough. Everything is good with my breathing, yes. You are asking many questions, Doctor. Is this all necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Barban. It’s a physical. We have to go through a checklist. Just answer the questions. Now, any problems with… digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion? No problems. I eat… food. Normal food. Sometimes spicy, sometimes not. Everything goes… through. I do not have… trouble. No stomach pain. No… other issues. Is this about the spicy food? Because I like it. My mother made very good spicy food. I do not understand why this is important.
DOCTOR: It’s not about the spicy food, Mr. Barban. Just trying to get a complete picture. Any… recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? No. I always weigh… this much. Maybe a little more in the winter, but it is the clothes. I do not… diet. I work hard, I eat. I do not worry about my weight. It is a good weight. Strong. You see?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Strong. Okay. And any problems with… sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? No. I sleep fine. I work hard all day, so I sleep. Maybe not long sleep, but good sleep. I do not… toss and turn. I do not need pills to sleep. What kind of problems would someone have with sleeping? Is that common? It sounds… strange. I am a practical man, Doctor. I sleep when I am tired.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Barban, are you experiencing any health issues at all?
PATIENT: No! I told you, Doctor. I work hard. I eat. I sleep. I am fine. You are asking me… foolish questions. I do not understand why you keep asking if I am sick. I came here for the insurance. To fill out the paperwork. I am not a patient with problems, I am a healthy man. Is that what you want to hear?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Fine. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to satisfy Medicare’s requirements. Then we can be done with this. Please, step onto the scale. And then we'll check your blood pressure. I need to document something here.
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. That is… acceptable. The scale is… over there? I will step on the scale. But I am telling you, it will be the same weight. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Yes, over there. Step on, please. Okay, 92 kilograms. And now, if you'll just sit down, I’ll take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yes. 92 kilograms. That is… about right. You are very quick with the typing, Doctor. I hope you are documenting everything correctly. My mother would want to know if something was wrong. Please… do it quickly. I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: 130 over 85. Not terrible, but… not ideal. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs, just briefly. Take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds… normal. Lungs clear. Okay. Everything seems… within normal limits. We’re done. I’ll print out a summary for Medicare. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I do not take medications. Never have. I do not believe in taking pills for everything. My mother made teas for everything. Teas and spices. No allergies. Just… no pills. You will write that down, yes? "No medications. No allergies." Is there anything else you need to know? I am ready to leave.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the summary for Medicare. It says "no known allergies, no current medications, generally healthy." They’ll probably want a repeat check-up in a year. Honestly, it's a lot of pointless paperwork. But it's my job. Just try to… get some rest occasionally. And if anything does change, you know, come see a doctor. Next patient is waiting. You can sign that form over there. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Yes, thank you Doctor. "Generally healthy." Good. That is what I said. I do not need rest. I need to work. Good day to you too, Doctor. And thank you for confirming that I am a healthy man. .
