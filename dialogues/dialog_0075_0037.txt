DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. My breathing… it makes a whistling sound sometimes. It’s been happening for a few days now, and it worries me a little. Especially when I walk fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A whistling sound with your breathing that’s been happening for a few days, and it seems to be worse with exertion, like when you walk quickly. Can you tell me a little more about that whistling sound?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… how you say… it’s not always there. When I sit and rest, it goes away. But if I try to do something, even just walking to the market, it comes back. It feels like… air is squeezed when I breathe out. And it makes me a little tired after a while. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand. So it’s intermittent – comes and goes – and triggered by activity. And you feel like your airways are constricted, a squeezing sensation with exhalation, and it leads to fatigue. Now, to get a better picture, have you had any cough associated with this whistling?
PATIENT: A little bit. Not a big cough, Doctor. Just a small one sometimes. Mostly in the mornings, when I first wake up. It’s not… a bad cough. More like I need to clear my throat. No… no colored anything when I cough. Just… normal. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Margret. A mild cough in the mornings, without any colored mucus. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any chest pain or tightness along with this, or shortness of breath when resting?
PATIENT: No, no pain. My chest feels… normal. It doesn’t hurt. And I can breathe okay when I am sitting. It’s only when I do things that it gets harder. Shortness of breath... yes, a little, when I walk up the hill to my friend’s house. But when I stop to rest, it gets better. Is that… is that normal? I worry I am bothering you with all this.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Margret, please don’t worry. It's my job to listen, and you're giving me very helpful information. So, no chest pain, shortness of breath only with exertion, and it improves with rest. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I don't think so. When I was a young girl, very young, I had a little trouble with my breathing sometimes, but my mother gave me some herbs, and it went away. I don’t know if that was asthma or not. And I haven't been to a doctor in… a very long time. I mostly try to stay healthy with exercise and good food. I used to be a trainer, you know? For athletes. Not anymore, though. My knees aren't so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some childhood breathing difficulties that resolved with herbal remedies, but no formal diagnosis of asthma. And a history of being quite active, though your knees now limit that. Have you had any recent colds or respiratory infections in the past few weeks or months?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t been sick. I feel… healthy, except for this breathing. I think maybe my neighbor had a cold, but I didn't get it. I try to be very careful. Wash my hands a lot, you know? And I stay away from people who are coughing. I don't like getting sick. It makes me feel very weak.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Margret. Very sensible. Now, just to complete the picture, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life. Maybe aspirin once or twice for a headache, but it didn’t bother me. And I eat all kinds of foods. I love spicy food! No… I don’t think I am allergic to anything. I haven’t had any… reactions. Is there anything else I should tell you? I want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Margret. No known allergies, and you haven’t experienced any reactions to medications. Okay, I'd like to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope and check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Please, do what you need to do. I just want to know what is happening with my breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. I do hear some wheezing, particularly when you exhale. It's subtle, but it's there. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good. Blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 78. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you may have some mild asthma, or possibly a condition called COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – though we need more information to confirm that. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of your airways. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never smoked. Not even a little bit! My husband smoked, a long time ago, but I always made him go outside. I never liked the smell. And I always told my children not to smoke either. It is very bad for you. I always thought I was very careful about my health, that’s why this is… worrying me. Is COPD very serious?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Margret. Never having smoked is excellent. And you're right to be concerned and to ask questions. COPD can be serious, but it depends on the severity, and it’s often linked to smoking. Since you've never smoked, it's less likely, but still possible. What we need to do is some testing to figure out what’s causing your breathing difficulties. I’d like to order a spirometry test, which measures how much air you can blow in and out of your lungs. It's a simple breathing test that will give us a better idea of what's going on. Would you be able to come back to the clinic next week for that test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A test to see what is happening. I can come back next week, yes. Whatever day is best for you. Just tell me when. I hope it is not too uncomfortable. Is it a long test? I have a friend who sometimes needs help getting around, so I need to plan things carefully.
DOCTOR: It’s a very straightforward test, Margret, and shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. It will take about 20-30 minutes, and the technician will guide you through it. You just need to breathe normally, and then blow out as hard as you can for a few seconds. We can schedule it for Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 pm. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:30 pm is… perfect, Doctor. Yes, that will work very well. And… what if it is asthma, or… the other thing? What would you do? I am a little scared, to be honest. I have always been healthy. I just want to be able to walk to the market without getting so winded.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be scared, Margret, and you're not alone in feeling that way. If it is asthma, it's very treatable with inhalers that help open up your airways. We can find one that works for you, and you should be able to manage it well. If it is COPD, we can also manage the symptoms with inhalers and pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that teaches you exercises and techniques to help you breathe easier. In either case, our goal is to get you back to doing the things you enjoy, like walking to the market, without feeling short of breath. I’ll explain everything in detail once we have the results of the spirometry test. For now, I’m going to write a prescription for a rescue inhaler – albuterol – that you can use if you feel your breathing getting tight. It's just to help you in the meantime. And I’ll give you some written instructions on how to use it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very reassuring. A little help in the meantime, and then a proper test. I appreciate that very much. A rescue inhaler, that is good. And written instructions, please. I sometimes forget things, you know. I want to thank you for being so patient with me. I worry a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t worry about forgetting things – it happens to all of us. I'll make sure you have everything in writing. Here’s the prescription for the albuterol inhaler, and this sheet explains how to use it properly. It's important to read the instructions carefully. It also has information about potential side effects. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have answered all my questions. You have been very kind and helpful. I will read the instructions carefully, and I will come back next Tuesday for the test. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. You have put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment next week. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you then. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
