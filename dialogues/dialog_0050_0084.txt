DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I am Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, just… gradually. And my mouth feels so dry, and my eyes too. It’s quite bothersome, honestly. I don’t… I don’t really know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: "Gradually," you say. A slow onset is… interesting. Can you elaborate on the breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Elaborate? It's… like there isn't enough air, even when I’m just sitting. It’s not a wheeze, not a cough… just… effort. More when I walk, maybe? Or try to do something. It’s hard to explain. I don’t remember ever feeling quite like this before.
DOCTOR: Effortful breathing… and exacerbated with activity. And you’ve noted dryness in your mouth and eyes as well. I see. Have you noticed any chest pain accompanying this difficulty?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, no pain. Just… tired. Very tired, sometimes. And thirsty, always thirsty. It feels like my throat is full of… sand, almost. But no pain. I don’t think so. It’s hard to… focus on pain when I’m trying not to… gasp for air, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Thirst and a sensation of something… foreign in the throat. Have you experienced any recent weight loss, Ms. Kobler?
PATIENT: Weight loss… That’s… a good question. I haven’t really been keeping track, if that makes sense? Things have been… unsettled, lately. But I feel thinner, perhaps? My clothes don't fit quite the same. It’s not a deliberate thing, I assure you. I’ve been eating, I think. Just… not much of an appetite, sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Not much of an appetite." Very well. And how about your medical history, Ms. Kobler?
PATIENT: Medical history… That’s… difficult. I don’t… remember a lot of details. I was divorced a few years back, and… things got a bit disorganized. I know I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, I believe. No major surgeries, I don’t think. I have private insurance, if that’s helpful? Honestly, Doctor, my memory just isn't what it used to be. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: "Disorganized," you say. Very well. Do you happen to recall if you’ve ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – asthma, allergies, diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: No… no chronic conditions that I know of. I really don’t think so. My… my ex-husband always handled the doctors' appointments. I just… went. I didn’t really pay attention to the details. I feel awful admitting this, but it’s the truth. I’m not trying to be difficult, Doctor, I simply… don’t remember. It's frustrating for both of us, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Frustrating is… a generous term, Ms. Kobler. It’s vital to have a complete medical history for accurate diagnosis. Now, regarding your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think? Something about… a valve? She needed medication. And my grandfather… he had something with his lungs. Always coughing. But details… I was very young. It was a long time ago. I don't recall exactly what they had, or the names of the conditions. I wish I could be more help, Doctor. It feels like my mind is… foggy.
DOCTOR: “Foggy,” you say. We will proceed as best we can, Ms. Kobler. Now, let's discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Absolutely not. I don't smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And… definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a writer, Doctor, not… that. I lead a very quiet life. Mostly just… writing and reading. I assure you, my lifestyle isn’t contributing to any of this.
DOCTOR: A quiet life, you say. Very well. And regarding your medications… are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin, I suppose. Just a standard one. And occasionally, I’ll take something for headaches – ibuprofen, maybe? Nothing regularly. Oh! And I sometimes use eye drops, because my eyes are so dry. But that’s it. Really. Just the basics. Nothing that would… cause this, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Very well. I believe we have enough preliminary information to proceed. I’m going to perform a physical examination now, Ms. Kobler. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your lungs and heart, and examine your throat and eyes. It will be… thorough.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. Thorough is good. I just… I would appreciate it if you could explain anything you find, if that's alright? I get worried when I don't understand things.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Again… and again. Lungs are clear bilaterally, although breathing is somewhat labored. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. No murmurs detected. Throat is mildly dry, some inflammation present. Conjunctivae are slightly injected. Pupillary response is normal. Your examination reveals some minor inflammation and dryness, consistent with your reported symptoms. However, the labored breathing is concerning. I would like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – to rule out any underlying infection or endocrine issues. Additionally, I am ordering a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs more thoroughly.
PATIENT: Blood work… and an X-ray? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is something terribly wrong? I mean, could it be… something bad? I understand you need to be thorough, but… it's quite frightening to hear. What are you looking for, exactly? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: "Serious" is a relative term, Ms. Kobler. I am taking a precautionary approach, given the ambiguity of your history and the concerning nature of your breathing. The blood work will assess your overall health and identify any potential infections or imbalances. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and rule out any structural abnormalities. I am primarily looking for signs of infection, inflammation, or underlying conditions affecting your respiratory system. The results typically take 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your fluid intake and avoid any strenuous activity. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Not right now. Just… 24-48 hours… I'll try to remain calm. And I will drink more fluids. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… taking the time, despite my… difficulties remembering things. I suppose I should schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes, schedule a follow-up appointment for five business days from today, Ms. Kobler. That will allow ample time for the results to return and be reviewed. My assistant will handle the scheduling for you. Until then, if your breathing worsens significantly, or you experience chest pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, proceed immediately to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Five business days… and the emergency room if it gets worse. Thank you again. I will… try not to worry. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be in contact. .
