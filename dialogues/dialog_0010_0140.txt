DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's… a bit embarrassing, really. It's something in my mouth. A white coating. It's not… pleasant. I assumed it would just go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel a little embarrassed – we deal with all sorts of things here. And you're right to get it checked out if it's not resolving on its own. A white coating in the mouth can have several causes, some more concerning than others. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe where exactly in your mouth this coating is?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a… specialist in oral anatomy. It's everywhere. On my tongue, inside my cheeks, the roof of my mouth… It's just… white. Like something’s been dusted on it. And it’s… a little uncomfortable, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it's just… there. I don’t see what’s so difficult to understand. It's white stuff in my mouth.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that, Mr. Schieber. And you’re right, the location is important. “Everywhere” is helpful to know. It sounds like it's fairly widespread. When did you first notice this white coating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must be… a couple of weeks, maybe? Three? Time sort of blurs, you know. It wasn't sudden. It just… appeared gradually. I initially dismissed it as… something I ate, perhaps. But it hasn't gone. I really don't have time for… lengthy investigations, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Schieber. A couple of weeks is good information. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I eat the same things. Steak, potatoes, sometimes chicken. Nothing unusual. I assure you, my diet is perfectly… normal. This isn't a dietary issue. I suspect it's… something else. Perhaps some sort of… infection? I really don't know. And frankly, I don’t want to spend hours trying to recall every single thing I've consumed in the past fortnight.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dietary changes. And I appreciate you letting me know that. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this coating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… my mouth feels a little… dry, perhaps? Not terribly, but a bit. And sometimes, just sometimes, it feels a little… sore after I eat something acidic. Like orange juice. But that could just be the orange juice, couldn’t it? I don't go in for all these… symptoms and ailments. It’s probably nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little dryness and some soreness with acidic foods. That's helpful. And you’re right, those could be related to the acidity. Now, I’d like to take a quick look inside your mouth, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But please be quick. I have… commitments. And I really dislike having people poke around in my mouth. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schieber. I see what you mean. There’s a widespread, white coating on your tongue, buccal mucosa – that’s the inside of your cheeks – and some on your palate. It doesn’t appear to be particularly inflamed or ulcerated, which is good. It does look like a case of oral thrush – a fungal infection. It’s not uncommon, especially if there's been some disruption to the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth. Do you have any conditions like diabetes or are you taking any medications that suppress your immune system?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Absolutely not! I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. And medications? Only what I need. A little something for my blood pressure, occasionally. Nothing… immunosuppressant. I assure you, Doctor, I am not a delicate flower. This… thrush, as you call it, sounds ridiculous. I've never had anything like this before. I suspect it's just… a temporary annoyance. What do you suggest? Some sort of… mouthwash? Just tell me what I need to do to get rid of it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I understand your frustration. While it can be a temporary annoyance, it's best to treat it to prevent it from worsening or spreading. The blood pressure medication can sometimes contribute to oral thrush, but it’s not always the case. I'm going to prescribe an antifungal mouthwash – Nystatin. You'll swish it around in your mouth for about a minute, twice a day, for seven days. Also, it’s important to maintain good oral hygiene: brush your teeth twice a day, floss daily, and drink plenty of water. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I'm not allergic to anything. Really. Just… get on with it. Write the prescription. I need to be going. This has taken far too long already. And are you certain this isn’t… contagious? My wife wouldn't appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, here's the prescription for the Nystatin. It’s not highly contagious, but it's best to avoid sharing utensils or close contact – like kissing – until the infection clears. I’ll also print out a sheet with instructions on how to use the mouthwash and a little more information about oral thrush. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if you develop any difficulty swallowing or fever, please come back, or see another doctor immediately. Do you have any other questions for me, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I suppose. I’ll get this sorted. Honestly, Doctor, I find it hard to believe a simple mouthwash will do the trick, but… I’ll try it. Goodbye.
