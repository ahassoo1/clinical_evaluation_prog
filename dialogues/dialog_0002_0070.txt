DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Ranjan, yes? Is good to meet you too. I… new here. Just moved. Small town, this. Needed to find a doctor, you know? Social… healthcare visit, they said. Something about that. I forget everything so fast these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kile, that’s right. Welcome to the area! A "social healthcare visit" just means a general check-up, to get a baseline of your health and make sure everything's okay since you’re new to the area. No need to worry. And forgetting things happens, especially as we get older. We'll take our time. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Why I decided… Well, my… ex-wife, she said I should. Always telling me what to do, that one. Said I look tired. Maybe it’s the air here. Different than the city. I don’t know. She made the appointment, mostly. I just… came. Is that enough? Is very confusing, all these questions.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Kile. It's very common for family members to encourage check-ups. And no, you don't need to have a long list of reasons. We can figure things out together. "Looking tired" is a good starting point. Just to be clear, and to get a better picture, have you been feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Tired… yes. Always tired, really. But maybe… more now? Hard to say. I work nights, you know? Makeup. For the… shows. Theater. Is not easy work. Long hours, lots of… faces. Very demanding. Sometimes I fall asleep standing up. Not good for the mascara, I tell you. But is what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work nights in theater, which is physically demanding. Falling asleep standing up is definitely something we should look into. That sounds exhausting. Besides the tiredness and falling asleep, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. My back hurts. Always hurts, but… worse now, maybe? And I… I think I lost weight. Not on purpose. Just… food doesn’t taste good anymore. Everything is… bland. Like cardboard. My ex-wife, she says I need to eat more vegetables. She always says that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain and a loss of appetite, with food tasting bland. That's helpful. And it sounds like the weight loss was unintentional. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms… uh. Sometimes my hands shake. Not all the time. Just when I’m… nervous, maybe? Or cold. Is not a big deal. Old hands. Been doing makeup for a long time. Very steady hands, usually. But sometimes… they wobble. And I get… little headaches. Behind my eyes. Like pressure. Is nothing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, hand tremors when you're nervous or cold, and headaches behind your eyes. It’s good you’re mentioning these things, even if they seem small. Now, let's go over a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… history. Oh, dear. Is long time ago. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor told me, years ago. And… something with my stomach. Ulcer, I think. But I don’t remember taking much medicine. Is always just… pain. And then, I just… keep working. My ex-wife, she’s always been the one to deal with the doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible hypertension and a history of a stomach ulcer. That's helpful. And it’s alright that you don’t remember all the details, we can try to get records if that’s okay with you. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Yes! I had my… appendix out. Long time ago. When I was young. And… I think I had something on my skin removed. A mole. But that was small. Just a little cut. Nothing important. Everything else… I don’t think so. Maybe? Is hard to remember, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a mole removal. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had… something with her heart. I think. She died young. And my father… he drank too much. That’s not a medical condition, is it? He just… wasn’t very healthy. No one in my family lived very long, really. Is just… bad luck, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems and alcohol use. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Always hated the smell. Makes my eyes water. My ex-wife, she tried to make me quit when we were married, but I never smoked, so… Is a waste of money, I think. Bad for the makeup, too. Makes you look old.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. A little vodka, maybe. After work. To relax. Not every night. Just… when I’m stressed. Is not a lot. I can stop anytime. Really. My ex-wife, she always said I drank too much. But she always says things.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional vodka use. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I think I’m allergic to… dust. Makes me sneeze. And… sometimes my skin gets itchy when I use cheap makeup. But is not a real allergy. Just… sensitive skin. Nothing serious. I don’t take any medicine, so… I don’t think so. No, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look in your ears and throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam… yes. Okay. If you must. Is not my favorite thing, but… I suppose. Just be quick, please? I have… things to do. Shows don’t do themselves, you know. And try not to poke too much. Sensitive. Yes. Very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kile. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you could just sit up here for me, and I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, your heart sounds a little fast, but I'll need to monitor that over time. Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically. And your ears and throat look normal. I'm just going to gently press on your stomach now. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Stomach… uh. Yes. A little. Here. It’s always a little sore. But is nothing. Just… discomfort. Like a dull ache. Been like that for years. Sometimes worse than others. Is probably just… old age. And too much coffee. Shows require it, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some tenderness there. And you're right, it does seem to be a chronic discomfort. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not necessarily concerning. Alright, Kile. Based on what you've told me and the exam, there are a few things I'd like to investigate further. Your symptoms – the tiredness, weight loss, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, and hand tremors – could be due to several different things. I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including your thyroid function, blood sugar, and vitamin levels. I also think it would be a good idea to get an upper endoscopy to take a closer look at your stomach and rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Endoscopy… blood work… is a lot. I don’t like doctors poking around. But… if you think is necessary. My ex-wife always said I need to listen to the doctors. Is probably best. Just… try to be quick, okay? And no surprises. I don’t do well with surprises. What kind of blood work? And… what is endoscopy exactly? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Kile. We’ll take things one step at a time and I'll explain everything thoroughly. The blood work will be a fairly standard panel – it checks for things like anemia, thyroid problems, diabetes, and vitamin deficiencies. It'll give us a good baseline of your overall health. As for the endoscopy, it's a procedure where we insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. It allows us to visualize the lining of your digestive tract and look for any abnormalities, like inflammation or ulcers. It’s done while you're sedated, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. You might feel a little discomfort afterward, like a sore throat, but it's usually mild. Would you like me to give you a pamphlet with more information about the endoscopy procedure?
PATIENT: Pamphlet… yes. Good. Information is good. Sedated… that sounds better. Not poking around while I’m awake. Is very important. So… what happens after the blood work? And how long does the endoscopy take? And… will it interfere with the shows? I have a big performance next week. Very important. Lots of… glitter.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It explains the procedure in detail, including what to expect beforehand and afterward. The blood work results usually take a few days to come back. Once I have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and decide on the next steps. The endoscopy itself usually takes about 15-30 minutes. You'll need to fast for several hours beforehand. And you’ll need someone to drive you home afterward, as the sedation can make you drowsy. As for the shows, we can schedule the endoscopy for a time that minimizes disruption to your performance schedule. You'll likely be able to return to work the next day, but it’s best to avoid strenuous activity for a few hours afterward, just to be on the safe side. We'll make sure it doesn’t interfere with your big performance next week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… yes. If I can still do the shows. Glitter is very important. And no surprises. You promise? Is very stressful, this. All this poking and prodding. My ex-wife always said I’m a delicate flower. She’s probably right. So… what do I need to do now? Do I sign something? Do I have to pay someone?
DOCTOR: Yes, Kile, I promise – no surprises. We’ll do everything we can to minimize your stress and ensure you can still do your shows. First, I’ll have my assistant schedule the blood work for you. They'll also give you a form to sign for consent and insurance purposes. You’ll likely have a co-pay depending on your insurance plan. As for the endoscopy, we'll schedule that once we have the blood work results. My assistant will also coordinate with your insurance company to get pre-authorization. Here's the phone number for the lab, and here’s my assistant’s extension if you have any questions. We'll take it one step at a time. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Numbers are good. And the assistant… is she nice? I don’t do well with… grumpy people. Very sensitive, you know. And the glitter… is very important. My ex-wife always said I have a flair for the dramatic. Is true. So… one step at a time. Yes. That sounds… manageable. I think. As long as no surprises. And the shows are safe.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kile, my assistant, Sarah, is very nice. She's very patient and understanding. You’ll be in good hands with her. And rest assured, we’ll do everything we can to keep your shows safe. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work scheduled. Once that’s done, we can take the next step. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think… that is all. Too much information. My head is spinning. Blood work… endoscopy… glitter… is very confusing. Just… tell Sarah to be nice. And no surprises. Is very important. And… thank you. I think. Maybe. Yes. Thank you. I think I need to sit down. Is very stressful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kile. I completely understand. It’s a lot to take in. I’ll make sure Sarah is aware of your preferences. Just take your time getting to the door. And if you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call. It was nice meeting you, Kile. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
