DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this…feeling full really fast. Like, I haven’t even finished a proper plate of food and I feel like I could take a nap. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not sure what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling full very quickly, even after only a small amount of food, and that’s been going on for about a month. I understand. That's definitely something we should look into. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t really matter what I eat, to be honest. Soup, fish, bannock… doesn’t seem to make a difference. And it’s not like I’m eating huge portions before it happens, either. Just a normal amount, I’d say. Maybe a bit less than I used to eat, now that I think about it, ‘cause I don’t want to feel stuffed all the time. It’s just… frustrating. Makes it hard to enjoy a good meal, you know? Especially when my wife makes something special.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Obarr. It’s certainly frustrating when something like that interferes with enjoying a good meal, especially when your wife puts in the effort. And it’s good you’re noticing the decrease in your usual portion size – that’s helpful information. So, regardless of what you eat, it happens pretty quickly, even with smaller portions. Do you experience any other symptoms along with that feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Maybe a little bit tired after eating, but I’m 88 years old, so that could just be…well, being 88. No pain, no bloating, no heartburn… nothing like that. Just…full. Quickly. It's not a bad full, just…uncomfortable and disappointing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Obarr. And you’re right, fatigue is common at any age, but we’ll keep it in mind. No pain, bloating, or heartburn is good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… maybe a little bit less? My wife keeps saying my pants are a bit loose, but I haven’t actually weighed myself in…oh, goodness, probably years. I try not to dwell on numbers, you know? But yeah, I’d guess I’ve lost a few pounds. Not a lot, just enough to notice the clothes being a bit roomier. It could just be the summer heat, though. It’s been a warm one.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s good you’re aware of the change in your clothing fit. A little bit of weight loss along with the early fullness is something we should investigate further. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I had a bit of a cough when I was younger, but that cleared up on its own. And my knees aren't what they used to be, but that's just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious ever, though. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, up until…well, this. My wife always said I was too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Obarr. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate. No major medical diagnoses is good information. And I understand about stubbornness – it can certainly contribute to good health! Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. I’ve always avoided hospitals if I could help it. Not a fan of doctors poking around, to be honest. This is the most time I’ve spent talking to a doctor in…well, a long time. Just a little nervous, I guess. But you seem alright. No surgeries, though, never needed ‘em. Thankfully.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Obarr. And I understand your hesitation – it's perfectly normal to feel that way. No surgeries is good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart when she was older. And my father, he had…well, I think it was diabetes. But he didn’t take good care of himself, always eating sweets. And there was an aunt on my wife’s side who had something with her stomach, but I don’t remember exactly what. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk much about health stuff back then. Mostly just tried to ignore it and get on with things. It's hard to say for sure, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Obarr. It’s common for family medical history to be a bit hazy. Knowing about the heart trouble, diabetes, and stomach issues is helpful, though. We'll make a note of those. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I’m retired, of course. Used to work with the radio, doing a bit of everything – announcing, fixing equipment, that sort of thing. Now I mostly just take it easy. I like to spend time with my wife, we do a bit of gardening, and I try to go for a short walk most days, weather permitting. I used to be more active, but my knees… well, you know. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. Not much for processed foods. A pretty simple life, really. But a good one.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very good life, Mr. Obarr. And it's good to hear about your active lifestyle and healthy eating habits. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken the odd painkiller for my knees over the years, but nothing serious. No food allergies, either. My wife makes all sorts of things, and I’ve never had a problem. No, no allergies. I think that’s everything, Doctor. Hopefully. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers everything for now, Mr. Obarr. Thank you for being so thorough. Based on what you’ve told me – the early fullness, slight weight loss, and family history – there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It could be something relatively minor, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Would you be comfortable if I conducted a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. Just…be gentle with the knees, alright? They creak enough as it is. What kind of exam are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Obarr. I’ll be very gentle with your knees, I promise. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll also take your blood pressure and pulse. It’s a fairly standard exam, and shouldn’t take too long. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breath, you say? There. Is that alright? Feels a bit strange, lying here listening to all that… thumping. But if it helps, I'm happy to cooperate. Just tell me what you're listening for, if you don't mind. I always like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear anything concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Starting on your right side… How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm… no pain, not really. A little bit tender right there, but that could just be from… well, being old, you know? Everything's a bit sensitive these days. Nothing sharp or sudden, just a dull ache. It's not bothering me much usually, just feels a bit…tight, maybe? Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Obarr. A little bit of tenderness in that area, described as a dull ache. It could be a number of things, and it doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 135/80, and your pulse is 72, which are both within a reasonable range. Based on the physical exam and your history, I'd like to order some blood tests to help narrow down the possibilities. These tests will check your complete blood count, liver and kidney function, and thyroid levels. I also think it would be prudent to order a stool test to rule out any hidden bleeding or infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a stool test… if it helps figure things out, I'm happy to do it. I don’t mind a bit of poking and prodding if it means knowing what's going on. Where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a doctor’s appointment scheduled with my wife next week, so I’d like to have something to discuss with him, if possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a requisition for the blood tests and the stool test. You can go to the lab at the Rural Health Center – it's just down the road. They’re open Monday to Friday, 8 AM to 4 PM. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. I'll have the results sent directly to my office, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available. That should give you plenty of time to discuss them with your wife's doctor at your appointment next week. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue eating a normal diet, and just monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact me immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Continue eating normally, monitor my symptoms, and contact you if anything changes. Three to five business days for the results… I can manage that. I’ll just try to be patient. And I will be sure to let you know if anything new pops up. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate it. Is there anything else I need to do, or anything else we need to discuss?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help. At this point, I think we've covered everything. Just remember, if anything changes or you become concerned, don't hesitate to contact me. Here's the requisition for the tests, and a summary of our discussion for your records. I'll also send a copy of this information to your wife's doctor, with your permission, of course. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Sending a copy to my wife’s doctor is a good idea. She’s always good at remembering things I forget. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. Have a good day. And thank you for being so gentle with the knees!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. And you’re right, it's always good to have someone to help remember things! Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Have a wonderful day, and please give my best to your wife.
