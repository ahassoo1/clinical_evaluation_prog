DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Altine, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Josie Altine. Look, I don't have all day, so if we could just get right to it, that’d be great. It's this heartburn, see? Just awful.
DOCTOR: Heartburn, right. And how long has this "awful" heartburn been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, a while now. Months, I suppose. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It comes and goes. It’s just… unpleasant. More frequent lately, though. Especially after I eat. And lying down. It’s just… common sense, really.
DOCTOR: Common sense… yes. Alright. And what do you eat, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Well, what don’t I eat? I enjoy a good meal. Steaks, sausages, pierogi, red sauce… you name it. I like flavor. Not this bland stuff people are eating these days. It’s all about moderation, isn't it? Though I admit, maybe I don’t always… moderate. And a little wine with dinner, of course. A man needs his comforts.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a fairly rich diet. Any other symptoms along with the heartburn?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes stuff comes up. You know… after I eat. Regurgitation, I think they call it. It's not pleasant. Tastes like… well, like dinner, usually. And I cough a bit sometimes, especially at night. It wakes my wife up. She complains. Honestly, it’s just a nuisance. It's not like it's serious.
DOCTOR: A nuisance… right. Any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Food goes down fine. It just… comes back up later. It's not like it’s stuck or anything. I’m not choking, if that's what you’re getting at. I can eat a full meal, no problem. A good full meal. Honestly, I think people worry too much about these things. It's just a bit of indigestion. It's what happens when you enjoy life, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking anything for it?
PATIENT: No. Why would I be? I figured it would just… go away. I don't go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. My father never took anything, and he lived to be 85. Tough Polish stock, you know? Besides, I don't like taking pills. They just make you feel worse. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick exam, then. Lie down on the examination table, please. I need to listen to your lungs and feel your abdomen. Don’t bother changing, just lie flat.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Honestly, this is a waste of a good afternoon. It's just a bit of heartburn. I could be home right now, enjoying a nice cup of tea. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Anything painful here?
PATIENT: No, nothing particularly. Just… uncomfortable. You're poking around. Honestly, you don't need to press so hard. It's just my stomach, you know? It’s full of a good Polish dinner. It’s supposed to be a little uncomfortable. Are you done yet?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Abdomen is…soft. No masses. Seems…unremarkable. Look, Mr. Altine, it sounds like you likely have GERD – gastroesophageal reflux disease. It's pretty common. It's caused by stomach acid coming up into your esophagus. Your diet isn’t helping.
PATIENT: GERD? Sounds fancy. So, it's just… heartburn? I already knew it was heartburn. And you're telling me my diet is the problem? Honestly, that's brilliant. I eat good food, I enjoy my life. I’m not changing my diet for a bit of indigestion. What am I supposed to eat, rabbit food? I think I'll just deal with it, thank you very much. Are we finished here? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Look, I can prescribe you something to reduce the acid, but frankly, you need to make some lifestyle changes. Here’s a prescription for Omeprazole. Take one a day before breakfast. And try to avoid spicy foods, fatty foods, and alcohol. And don't lie down immediately after eating. This is a handout with more information. I'm also scheduling a follow-up in a month, but if it gets worse, see a gastroenterologist. Next!
