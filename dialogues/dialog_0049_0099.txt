DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Or… is it pronounced differently?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Nestingen. Denis is perfectly correct, thank you for asking. It is a pleasure to meet you.
DOCTOR: Yes. Well. Let’s get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. I received the results of my GI endoscopy test, and… well, they indicated something wasn’t quite right. I must confess, I am a bit anxious about it. Could you explain what the test showed, in… layman’s terms, if you please?
DOCTOR: Right. The endoscopy. Yes. It… detected some inflammation in your esophagus, and a small area of concern in your stomach. “Concern” is a rather broad term, of course. It appears to be… a potential ulcer. Though, a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation. Do you experience any pain?
PATIENT: Pain, yes… occasionally. It’s not a constant ache, more like a burning sensation, usually after I eat. It’s… difficult to describe. It comes and goes, and isn’t always severe. I thought it was just… indigestion, perhaps. I've always had a rather sensitive stomach, if I'm honest. It hasn’t been troubling me enough to seek medical attention until now, naturally. But the test results… they do give me pause.
DOCTOR: “Sensitive stomach.” That’s… vague. Burning sensation after eating. And you haven’t experienced any… bleeding?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no bleeding. Not that I’ve noticed, at least. Sometimes, when I… well, when I use the restroom, there might be a slightly darker color than usual, but I attributed that to… certain foods. Beets, perhaps. Or dark berries. I eat a lot of fruit. I am quite careful about what I ingest, and generally maintain a healthy diet. I've always believed in preventative care, even if I haven't always sought medical intervention.
DOCTOR: Beets. Right. And your weight… the chart indicates 58 kilograms. Are you intentionally maintaining a low weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. I am rather… slender by nature. Always have been. It’s simply my build. I’ve never been one to… gain weight easily. My late husband, bless his soul, always joked that I could eat anything and remain the same size. It’s not a conscious effort, I assure you. I eat sufficiently to sustain myself and maintain my energy levels. I work with metals and plastics, you see, and that requires a certain amount of… physical exertion. It's a demanding trade.
DOCTOR: A demanding trade. And you said you work with… metals and plastics?
PATIENT: Yes. I've been a metal worker and plastic worker for… well, for nearly fifty years now. My husband and I owned a small workshop. We made everything from decorative items to… well, practical tools. After his passing, I continued it on my own, though I've scaled back considerably in recent years. It keeps my mind active, and provides a small income. I've always enjoyed working with my hands, transforming raw materials into something useful, or beautiful. But it is physically demanding, as I mentioned. Perhaps that contributes to my sensitivity? I hadn’t considered that before.
DOCTOR: Possibly. Though, I suspect it's more likely a combination of factors. We'll need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any family history of… stomach issues?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we are of Aztec descent, and records were not always meticulously kept. My parents… they passed away when I was quite young. I don’t recall them mentioning any specific ailments, though my grandmother… she suffered from a chronic stomach discomfort, if I recall correctly. But it was never properly diagnosed, or treated, as far as I know. It was simply… accepted as a part of life. It wasn’t uncommon, in those days. I am not certain if it was related to what I am experiencing now.
DOCTOR: “Accepted as a part of life.” Yes. Well. We’ll need to perform a few tests to get a clearer picture. A stool sample, to rule out any infection. And a blood test, to check for… deficiencies. I also recommend a follow-up endoscopy, perhaps with a biopsy, to determine the extent of the inflammation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A stool sample, a blood test, and another endoscopy… I am willing to undergo whatever is necessary to determine the cause of this discomfort. I appreciate your thoroughness. When would you like to schedule these tests? I am relatively flexible, though I prefer mornings, if possible. And… might I ask about the potential costs involved? I am… not insured, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Costs. Yes. That’s… always a concern. The stool sample is relatively inexpensive. The blood test… moderately priced. The endoscopy, however, is quite costly. Given your lack of insurance, you may want to… consider your options carefully. Let's schedule the stool sample and blood test for next week. Monday morning?
PATIENT: Monday morning sounds acceptable, Doctor. Very acceptable. And… regarding the endoscopy, if the cost is prohibitive, are there alternative methods of diagnosis? Perhaps imaging scans? I understand you are busy, and I don’t wish to impose, but I must be mindful of my limited resources. I’ve managed on my own for quite some time now, and… prefer to avoid incurring unnecessary debt.
DOCTOR: Imaging scans are… less reliable. They can’t provide the same level of detail as an endoscopy. But… we could consider a CT scan, as a preliminary step. Though, I must warn you, it’s not ideal. And it still involves cost. Let me make a note of that. We'll schedule the blood test and a CT scan for next week. And then… we'll reassess. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I pride myself on maintaining my health naturally. I’ve always been… hesitant to rely on pharmaceuticals, preferring to address any ailments through diet and… rest. I occasionally take herbal teas for minor discomfort, but nothing prescribed by a physician. I believe a strong constitution is the best medicine. Perhaps that’s why I’ve managed for so long without seeking medical attention, until now. It's just… this test result is quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Strong constitution.” Yes. Well. We’ll see. It’s always best to be thorough. Alright. Let’s get you scheduled. Monday morning. Be sure to fast for at least eight hours before the blood test. Do you have any allergies to… anything?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. I've eaten a rather varied diet throughout my life, and have never experienced any adverse reactions to food, or… anything else, for that matter. I’ve occasionally been stung by insects, of course, but that’s to be expected when working outdoors. No specific sensitivities, no known allergies. I suppose I am remarkably… resilient. Though, as I said before, this recent test result has shaken my confidence somewhat. It is… unusual for me to require medical intervention.
DOCTOR: Very well. Monday morning, then. The lab will contact you with specific instructions. I'll review the results and contact you with a follow-up plan. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time, and your thoroughness. I appreciate you addressing my concerns, and explaining the process so clearly. I trust your judgment implicitly, and will follow your instructions to the letter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Perhaps… a little apprehensive, but hopeful nonetheless. It is reassuring to finally have a plan of action.
DOCTOR: Good. See you Monday.
