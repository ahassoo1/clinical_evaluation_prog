DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I don’t really remember much... something about some tests? The lady on the phone said something about lab work. I just need whatever paperwork I need for that, if that’s alright. I’d like to get this over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you may have been scheduled for some routine labs. No problem at all, we can definitely get that sorted out. Just to be absolutely sure, and to help me get a complete picture of your health, would you mind if I asked a few quick questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh, goodness. I’m not so good with remembering things, as I said. Quick is good. Very quick. Is this about, you know, what’s wrong with me? Because I honestly don’t know. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We'll just cover some basics, nothing too intense. And yes, these questions are to figure out what's going on – or, to be more accurate, to see if we can figure out what might be going on. Let's start with this: have you been feeling generally okay lately?
PATIENT: Generally okay… hmm. That’s… a difficult question. I suppose I’m still standing, aren’t I? But everything feels… distant. Like watching a movie of my own life. I don’t really feel much of anything, if that makes sense. No aches, no pains… just… empty, a little. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That does answer my question, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Croonquist. "Distant" and "empty" are very helpful descriptions. And has this feeling – this distance – come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual, I think. Very, very gradual. It's hard to say. Years, maybe? I can't pinpoint a moment, if that makes sense. It’s like… waking up one day and realizing the colors aren’t as bright as they used to be. But I can't tell you when they started to fade. Does that make any sense at all? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Croonquist, don't apologize at all. You’re describing things very clearly, actually. Okay. And, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I remember to, I suppose. Usually something simple. Sleep… hmm. I sleep alright. Not much to sleep about, if you know what I mean. I wake up a lot, but… that’s been happening for years. It’s not like I’m restless or anything. Just… quiet. Does that… is that helpful? I really just need the paperwork for the lab work, if we could get to that.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. It helps me rule things out, or figure out what to look into further. Okay. Just a few more quick questions, then we can definitely get that paperwork sorted out. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. No chest pain either. And… dizziness? Not really. Though… sometimes I feel a bit… disconnected, if that makes sense. Not dizzy, exactly. Just… not here. Does that count? I really… I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: That does count, Mr. Croonquist. “Disconnected” is important information. It sounds like you're very aware of how you're feeling, even if it's hard to put into words. Alright. Last few quick things, and then we’ll get you set up with the lab order. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urinary function?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re getting into details I really don't want to talk about. Everything’s… regular, I suppose. As regular as it’s been for an old man. Nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to get this lab work done and be on my way. It's all a bit overwhelming, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. We will get you set up with the lab work, and I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. Just to clarify, you've been feeling generally “distant” and “empty” for several years, with no specific onset. No chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or changes in bowel or urinary function. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that’s pretty accurate, yes. Years, exactly. No… nothing dramatic. Just… fading. That sums it up. Can we… can we get to the paperwork now, please? I really appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. You’ve been very patient with me as well. Now, to get this lab work ordered, I just need to confirm a few things. Your name is Early Croonquist, age 73, and your insurance is Medicare, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Early Croonquist, 73, Medicare. Thank goodness. Is there anything I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand? Or… bring a sample? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. For this particular panel, we'll need a fasting blood sample. That means no food or drinks – except water – for 8-12 hours before your appointment. And please bring a list of any medications you are currently taking, if you have one. Otherwise, the lab should have everything they need. Here’s the order. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll take good care of you. Do you have any questions about the order or the fasting requirement?
PATIENT: No food… eight to twelve hours… Okay, I think I can manage that. And a list of medications… hmm. I don't really take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen now and then, for my back. But nothing consistent. Room 203, you said? Alright. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. If anything changes, or you start to feel worse, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. And don’t worry about the ibuprofen – that’s not something we need to document for this particular order. Have a good day, and I hope you get some answers.
