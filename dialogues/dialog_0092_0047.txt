DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Good to meet ya too. Uh… well, I think it’s about… the long-term care stuff? My daughter, she set this up. I don't really remember all the details, but it has something to do with… making sure I’m okay later on, I guess. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your daughter is proactive about your health, which is wonderful. “Long-term care” can cover a lot of things. To help me understand what’s concerning her – and you – could you tell me a bit more about what specifically prompted this appointment?
PATIENT: Prompted…? Hmm. Well, my wife… she passed a few years back. And I ain’t been… the sharpest since then, I suppose. Just… forgetful. Little things, mostly. But my daughter, bless her heart, she says it’s gettin’ worse. She worries I won't be able to take care of myself someday. I don't really notice it, not much. Just… days where I can’t find my keys, or remember what I had for breakfast. Stuff like that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to experience some memory changes as we age, and grief can certainly contribute to those changes. It’s good your daughter is observant and wants to ensure you’re well cared for. So, to get a clearer picture, let's talk a little more about these memory concerns. You mentioned forgetting where you put things, like your keys, and having trouble recalling recent events, such as what you ate for breakfast. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It ain’t like I woke up one day and couldn’t remember nothin’. Just… slowly gettin’ worse, I guess. It’s hard to say, really. Time kinda… blurs together sometimes. I mostly just try not to worry about it. My daughter does enough worryin’ for the both of us. But she said this insurance thing could help, so I figured I’d come in.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. It is difficult to pinpoint gradual changes. And it’s very considerate of you to try not to worry your daughter. To help me assess things further, could you tell me about any other changes you've noticed, besides the memory issues?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Well, I get… tired easier now, I reckon. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now, I gotta take a few breaks. And… sometimes I have trouble findin’ the right words, when I’m talkin’. Not all the time, but… it happens. It’s kinda frustratin’, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue and difficulty finding words can certainly be concerning, and it’s good you’re acknowledging them. These symptoms, along with the memory issues, are things we should investigate. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Medical… Uh, the doc told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on some pills for it. I take ‘em every day, I think. I usually let my daughter handle all that stuff, to be honest. I can’t really remember the name of ‘em, or much else about it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can certainly look into your medications. Do you happen to know the dosage of the blood pressure medication you’re taking?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t. I really don’t pay attention to those things. I just take what she gives me. She labels ‘em, so I know which ones to take when. I’m sorry, Doc. I wish I could be more help. It’s just… my mind ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. Don't apologize; it's completely understandable. We'll get the information we need. It’s good your daughter helps manage your medications. Let’s check your electronic health record. Okay, I see here you’re currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension, diagnosed approximately five years ago. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playin’ around. Does that count? And… oh, right. I had my appendix out, a long time ago. Musta been… forty, fifty years back. That’s all I can really remember, Doc. It was a long time ago. Everything kinda… blurs together.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood broken arm and an appendectomy many years ago. Good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mom… she got kinda forgetful when she got older. Real forgetful. She ended up in a home, I think. My dad… he was strong as an ox. Lived a long life, but I don’t remember him havin’ any… health problems, not really. Lots of us just… lived. Didn't talk about sickness much.
DOCTOR: I see. Your mother experienced memory issues later in life, and your father was generally healthy. That's helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, sir, never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, back when my wife was still around. But I haven't had a drink in… oh, goodness, must be ten years now. And drugs? Absolutely not. Never been one for that sort of thing. Just a simple man, Doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption in the past, and no recreational drug use. Good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, Doc. I eat pretty much anything. Never had any trouble with food, or pills, or… anything, really. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach. She always worried about me eatin’ somethin’ bad. But I always seemed to be alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That completes my initial questions, Mr. Rover. Thank you for your patience and honesty. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and a quick neurological assessment, including checking your reflexes, balance, and memory. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure, Doc. Whatever ya need to do. I trust ya. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? My old bones ain't what they used to be. But yes, go ahead. Do what ya gotta do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, with good air movement bilaterally. Next, I’ll test your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you please stand up and try to balance on one foot for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Oh, these knees… Alright, alright. Whoa there… Not as steady as I used to be, Doc. But I guess that comes with age.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Rover. A little wobble is common. Now, let’s do a brief cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and thinking skills. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Hmm. August… the second, right? Yes, August the second. Is that right, Doc? I get my days mixed up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. August second. Good. Now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tough one. You know… it’s right on the tip of my tongue… I just… can’t seem to pull it up right now, Doc. I used to follow the news… but my mind ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Rover. It's not a problem. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words back to me. Listen carefully: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those words for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple… table… penny. Did I get ‘em right, Doc?
DOCTOR: Yes, you repeated those words correctly. Now, I’m going to ask you to subtract 7 from 100, and then subtract 7 again from that result.
PATIENT: Subtract seven from a hundred… that’s… ninety-three. And then… seven from ninety-three… Uh… eighty-six? No… wait… Is it eighty-six, Doc? I’m not so good with numbers anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Rover. It’s a challenging calculation. 86 is a good effort. Based on the physical exam and your responses to these questions, you are experiencing some cognitive decline, particularly with recent memory and calculation. However, the findings are not severe enough to make a definitive diagnosis at this time. Given your history of forgetfulness, fatigue, and difficulty with word finding, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a more comprehensive cognitive assessment conducted by a neurologist. Would you be open to those steps?
PATIENT: Tests… a neurologist… Sounds like a lot, Doc. But… if it'll help figure out what's goin’ on… then yes. Yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to poke too much, alright? And maybe my daughter can come with me to the neurologist? I get kinda lost these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. We will keep things as comfortable as possible and I absolutely encourage your daughter to accompany you to the neurologist appointment. Okay, I will write the orders for the blood tests now. They will check for basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin B12 and vitamin D levels. The lab results usually take a few days. I will also provide you with a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Her contact information is included in this packet. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving, operating machinery, or making any important financial decisions. It’s also a good idea to stick to a familiar routine and to ensure you’re getting adequate rest and nutrition. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not right now, Doc. I think… I think my head’s a little full. Just… try not to rush me, alright? And thanks… for takin’ the time. I appreciate it. I'll let my daughter handle the scheduling and everything. She's good at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. Take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I will follow up with you in a week to discuss the lab results and ensure you've been able to schedule your appointment with Dr. Vance. Here is a copy of your discharge instructions, and the lab order. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
