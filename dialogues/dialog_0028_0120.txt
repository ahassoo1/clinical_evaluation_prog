DOCTOR: Right. Carmaleta Villarreal, 43 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I just… want to get this done with. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure everything works before I waste any time. My husband… well, he passed, and I don't want to be too old when it happens, you know? It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Practical concerns are perfectly reasonable. "Wasting time" isn't the term I'd use, but I understand the urgency. You want a fertility check, essentially?
PATIENT: Check, assessment, whatever you call it. I just… is there anything wrong with me that would stop it? I had kids with my husband, no problems then, but that was… a while ago. I don't need a whole life story, just tell me if I need to worry. And quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: "Quickly" isn't how this works, but I suppose we can focus. You've had children previously, you say. How many, and when was your last pregnancy?
PATIENT: Ugh, numbers… Look, I had two. A boy and a girl. Let me think… the last one… goodness. It must have been… fifteen years ago? Maybe a little more. It was before… everything. Honestly, dates aren’t my strong suit. It feels like a lifetime ago. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: Fifteen years. Significant time lapse. Have you experienced any changes in your menstrual cycle since then?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? They… stop sometimes. Then they start again. It’s irregular. That’s what I know. Honestly, I don’t keep a calendar or anything. It’s just… there, then it’s not. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Irregularity is… a relevant detail. And, yes, it could indicate a problem, or it could not. We’ll need to investigate. Have you noticed any pain with your periods, or between them?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Like, normal cramping, you know? Nothing I haven't dealt with before. Not excruciating, just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes, so it’s hard to say if it’s something to worry about. Honestly, I just take some pills and get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any bleeding between your periods, or after intercourse?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you trying to scare me? Look, I'm not one for getting into all the details of… things. No. No bleeding. Stop. Just... no. Is that what you wanted to hear?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: I had… high blood pressure, for a little while. But it’s under control now. Doctor put me on something. Pills, again. Besides that… no, nothing major. I’m generally healthy. I eat… okay. Look, I don't spend my life in a hospital, alright?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, currently managed. Good. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Yes! Like I said. For my blood pressure. A little white pill. I think it’s… hydro… something. Honestly, I don't remember the exact name. I just take it every morning. It's enough that I have to take something, okay?
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide, presumably. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that could be anything, really. Dust, cats, who knows. Nothing serious enough to worry a doctor about. Look, I'm not one of those people with a list of things I can't eat or touch.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination then. Please, step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Must we? I just told you I'm generally healthy. But fine. Let’s get this over with. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: 130 pounds, height is noted as 164 centimeters. Blood pressure is 128/76. Normal. Pulse is 72. Lungs clear. Heart sounds regular. I’ll need to do a pelvic exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Must you? Look, I'm not comfortable with that, honestly. Can’t you just… give me a pill or something? Can't you tell if something is wrong just by looking at my chart? I’m not getting any younger, you know. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: A proper examination is necessary to determine if there are any underlying issues preventing conception. I understand your discomfort, but I cannot offer a diagnosis, or prescribe medication, without one. It’s a standard procedure. If you refuse, I will have to refer you to another physician. It's your choice, of course, but it will significantly delay the process. We can discuss the procedure and I can ensure your comfort, but refusal means no further assessment here.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! But you better be quick about it. And gentle. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just… get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on the table and keep your knees bent. I will explain each step as I go. It will only take a few moments. Cervix appears normal, no obvious masses. Uterus feels… slightly enlarged, but that could be normal. Ovaries are… difficult to palpate, but no immediate concerns. Alright. That was… straightforward. I will need to order some blood tests to check your hormone levels, and a transvaginal ultrasound to get a better look at your uterus and ovaries. Would you like to schedule those tests now?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? More poking and prodding? Look, I’m really starting to regret this. Just… whatever tests you think are absolutely necessary. Get it done quickly and tell me what it means. No long explanations, alright? Just… the bottom line. I don't have time for a lecture.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll order a complete hormone panel and a transvaginal ultrasound. The lab results will take approximately 3-5 business days. The ultrasound can be scheduled for next week. I'll have the receptionist contact you with appointment times. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Once I have the results, we can discuss potential causes of your irregular cycles and options for fertility treatment, if necessary. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, nothing. Just get the results to me as soon as possible. Honestly, I've wasted enough time here already. .
DOCTOR: The receptionist will be in touch. Good day.
