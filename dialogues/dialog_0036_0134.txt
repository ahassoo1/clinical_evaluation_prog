DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Oh, goodness… well, I’ve just been feeling… off. Mostly, it’s my stomach. It feels sick a lot, and I get full so quickly when I eat. It’s… well, it’s been worrying me. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling “off” and having stomach issues with early fullness is certainly something we want to look into. It’s perfectly normal for things to feel fuzzy sometimes, especially as we get older. Let’s try to piece things together. When you say “sick,” can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like a bad stomach ache, exactly. More… queasy? Like I might throw up, but I usually don’t. And it doesn’t come and go like the flu. It just… sits there. A lot of the time, I just don’t feel like eating because of it. And then when I do try, a couple of bites and I’m done. It’s just… not normal, is it? I used to have a good appetite. I trained animals for years, you know, and you need your energy for that!
DOCTOR: No, it’s not normal if it’s a change from what you’re used to, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Queasiness without vomiting, and feeling full quickly… those are helpful details. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a hard question. I try to eat… well, what I used to. Toast and eggs for breakfast, usually. Sometimes just a little bit of fruit. Lunch… maybe a sandwich. Or soup, if it’s cold. And dinner… I try for something with meat and vegetables. But like I said, I haven’t been eating much lately. A few bites here and there. My daughter, bless her heart, tries to make sure I get enough. She worries about me. It’s hard to say what I eat on any given day, though. It depends on how I’m feeling, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a general idea. It sounds like you're trying to maintain a pretty standard diet. And it's good that your daughter is looking out for you. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the queasiness and early fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been… tired. More tired than usual, I mean. And sometimes I feel a little… weak. Not like I’m going to fall over, but just… lacking energy. And, oh! My stomach… it bubbles sometimes. Not painful bubbles, but… you can feel them. Is that… normal? I forget so easily these days... I hope I'm not just rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Raymonde. These details are very helpful. Tiredness, weakness, and bubbling in your stomach – those are all things we should consider. Now, I’d like to ask a bit more about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a long time ago now. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… arthritis, of course. Everyone gets arthritis when they get old, don’t they? And… well, a few years back, they found… cancer. In my… stomach, I think. It’s been a while. I’ve been getting checked regularly since then. Is that… is that what this is about? It coming back?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that information with me. It’s important to know about your past history of stomach cancer. It’s good you’ve been getting regular check-ups. Let’s clarify a few things. I’m not assuming it’s a recurrence at this point, Raymonde. We need to investigate to understand what’s going on. You said you’ve been getting checked regularly – do you recall when your last scan was, and what the results were?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a good question. I see Dr. Henderson, you know, the oncologist. He’s a good man. But I’m terrible with dates. I think… it was maybe six months ago? He said everything looked okay. But that was six months ago… and I’ve been feeling worse lately. He does a lot of poking and prodding, and looks at the pictures… I don’t understand what he says half the time, to be honest. He talks about… tumors and… things. It all just becomes a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago with no changes reported then. That’s helpful. It's completely understandable that the details become blurry. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as stomach cancer or other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. My mother… she had stomach trouble, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. She died when I was young. And my father… he was a strong man, didn’t have much trouble with his health. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. She lives out west somewhere. I don’t know anything about her health, I’m afraid. We weren't very close. I don't really have much information about my family's health history, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing what you know. It’s alright that you don’t have a lot of information; we can still proceed. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take something for my arthritis. It’s a little white pill… I think it's called… celecoxib? Yes, that’s it. And sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, but Dr. Miller said I didn't need it anymore. So I don't always remember to take it. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter says I need it for my bones. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else that I can recall. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, celecoxib for arthritis, occasional medication for blood pressure, and a vitamin D supplement. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. It just hurt a bit, that's all. Nothing serious. I don't have any known allergies, to my knowledge. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’ve always just tried to take things as they come. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. I’m hearing normal heart and lung sounds. Your abdomen is tender to the touch in the upper area, and slightly distended. No significant findings otherwise. Given your history of stomach cancer, the tenderness and distention are concerning, even though they aren’t severe. I’d like to order some blood tests and an abdominal CT scan to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then let’s do it. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? It’s unsettling to feel… off, and not know why. A CT scan… will that show me what’s going on? I hope it’s not… too serious.
DOCTOR: The CT scan will give us a detailed look at your abdominal organs, including your stomach, liver, and pancreas. It can help us identify any abnormalities, such as tumors or inflammation. I understand your concern, Raymonde, and we’ll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and treatment plan. I’ll order the blood tests and the CT scan right away. The lab should be able to draw your blood today, and we can schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat small, frequent meals, and avoiding any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever, please call my office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Small meals… I can manage that. And I will call if anything changes. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something about it. Now, about the CT scan… will I have to drink anything special beforehand? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Yes, for the CT scan, you will need to drink a contrast solution about an hour before the procedure. It helps to visualize your abdominal organs more clearly. The radiology department will give you specific instructions when they call to schedule your appointment. They will explain the preparation process in detail. They will likely ask you to fast for a few hours beforehand as well. It's best to check with them directly to confirm the exact instructions. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I'll just wait for the call from the radiology department and try to remember what you said about the contrast solution. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. I really appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. I’ll see you soon, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together.
