DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. I suppose you could say I'm… vetting a potential life partner. It's a bit ridiculous, I know, but one has to be careful these days. I'm dating someone new, and I thought it prudent to get a… thorough assessment before things progress any further.
DOCTOR: That's... certainly a proactive approach, Ms. Pandolfi. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. By "thorough assessment," are you referring to a general check-up to ensure you're both in good health, or are you looking for something more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’m quite healthy, thank you. Medicare sees to that. No, I simply want to be sure… well, that he is who he says he is. And that there aren’t any… hidden surprises. You understand, don't you? A woman must protect herself. It's not about my health, necessarily. It's about… compatibility, shall we say? And avoiding… regrettable situations.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern for safety and wanting to ensure a healthy relationship, Ms. Pandolfi. What I can offer is a comprehensive medical evaluation of your health status. We can review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and discuss any concerns you have about your own well-being. Regarding your partner, I'm unfortunately unable to provide medical information about someone who isn't a patient of mine. That would be a violation of patient privacy and ethical guidelines. However, if he is interested, he’s welcome to become a patient here and we can assess his health independently. Perhaps we can focus on ensuring your health is optimal, and discuss any potential red flags you might be experiencing in the relationship from a general wellness perspective?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I wasn’t intending to ask for his medical records directly. I simply assumed a professional such as yourself would have… resources. A way to verify credentials, perhaps? Confirm employment? Things of that nature. I’m not asking you to divulge confidential information, simply to exercise… due diligence. It's rather unsettling, frankly, that you haven’t anticipated this need. A woman in my position requires reassurance. I suppose I expected a bit more… discretion. Frankly, I’m beginning to wonder if I’ve come to the right place.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your concerns and your need for reassurance. However, my role as a physician is solely focused on providing medical care and protecting patient health information. I am ethically and legally prohibited from conducting investigations into someone's personal history, verifying employment, or confirming credentials outside of a medical context. I apologize if that was not clear initially. It sounds like you may be seeking information that falls outside the scope of medical practice. Perhaps a background check service or a private investigator would be better suited to your needs. I am happy to provide you with a list of reputable resources in the area if you would like. However, I can offer a thorough assessment of your health and discuss any health-related concerns you have about the relationship. Would you like to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. It’s rather tiresome having to spell everything out. I wasn’t expecting a full-blown investigation, simply a basic level of… verification. One wouldn’t introduce a stranger into their life without knowing they are who they claim to be, would one? I’m not asking for his medical history, just confirmation of his… existence, so to speak. It’s a simple precaution. And frankly, suggesting I hire a private investigator is… insulting. It implies I have something to hide, or that I’m prone to paranoia. I assure you, I am neither. I simply want a professional opinion on… his plausibility. Is that really too much to ask? Perhaps I should speak with someone else. Someone with a bit more… common sense.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your frustration, and I sincerely apologize if I haven't met your expectations. However, I must reiterate that providing verification of someone’s identity or background outside of a medical context is beyond my professional capabilities and ethical guidelines. It's not a matter of willingness, but a matter of legal and ethical restrictions. I appreciate you sharing your concerns, and I want to be respectful of your needs. However, I’m unable to fulfill your request. Continuing this conversation may not be productive, and I want to ensure I am providing you with appropriate and ethical medical care. If you would like to proceed with a general health assessment, I am happy to do so. If not, I understand. I can provide you with a list of resources that may be better suited to your needs, including background check services. Do you wish to continue with a medical evaluation, or would you prefer I refer you to alternative resources?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, your inability to assist me is… disappointing, to say the least. I came to a professional seeking reassurance, and I've been met with… bureaucracy and restrictions. It seems discretion and common sense are in short supply these days. No, I do not wish to continue. I suspect I would be better served elsewhere. Thank you for your time, though I confess I find it has been… unproductive.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
