DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. Travel, I think? My wife… she wanted to go somewhere. Before… before everything. I got the paper, the one they sent. Something about shots? I don’t really remember where we were even going. Somewhere warm, I think. It was her idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, travel related… and you're not entirely sure of the destination. That's alright, we can work through it. It sounds like you may have been advised about travel vaccinations. Before we get into specifics, could you tell me a little more about when you travelled?
PATIENT: Travelled? Uh… not yet. We planned to travel. A few weeks ago, maybe? Before… she got sick. I haven’t been anywhere since. Just… here. Dealing with things. I don’t even know if I am going. It feels wrong, going without her. But the paper… they want me to get things done before. That’s why I’m here. It’s confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely understandable that you're feeling confused and overwhelmed right now, especially with everything else going on. The paperwork is likely related to vaccinations needed before travel, even if the trip hasn’t happened yet. It’s good you’re getting it sorted. So, to clarify – you haven’t actually travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No. No travel. Not yet. Just… plans. Big plans. She… she liked to plan. Always looking at maps and… brochures. I just went along. I don’t really do planning. I just… fixed things. Airplanes, mostly. That’s my job. So, no. No travel. Just paperwork. And… sadness. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That is perfectly okay, Odell. It’s perfectly okay to feel sadness, and it's good you're being honest with me. We can absolutely focus on the paperwork then. Do you happen to have that paperwork with you today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hold on… here. It’s a mess, sorry. She did most of the organizing, you see. I just… carry things. It says… “Travel Clinic Consultation Form.” Lots of boxes. And… some words I don’t understand. Yellow fever? What’s that? Sounds bad.
DOCTOR: Let's take a look together. Yellow fever is something we consider for certain travel destinations, but it’s not necessarily something you need. It’s a mosquito-borne illness, more common in parts of South America and Africa. First, let's try to narrow down where you were intending to travel. Do you remember anything about the region?
PATIENT: Region… uh… She said… islands? Warm islands. Palm trees. Beaches. She liked the pictures. I think… maybe the Caribbean? Or… was it further? Something with… volcanoes? I really don’t know. She did all the research. I just… made sure the suitcases were strong enough. And the tickets were printed. This is hopeless. It was a long time ago, now. I don’t remember details.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Odell. It's completely understandable, especially with everything you've been through. Caribbean and Pacific Islands narrows it down a bit. Let’s look at your medical history then, just to be safe. Have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? Uh… tetanus, maybe? When I was a kid? I get a booster sometimes for work, I think. Something about being around… machines. And… people. But I don’t really keep track. It’s not something I worry about. I fix things. Not… bugs. Or… shots. My wife took care of all that. She was very organized. I am… not. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that's not a problem at all. We just need to get a clearer picture. Tetanus is good to know, and the booster for work is helpful. Do you know if you've ever had vaccinations for things like measles, mumps, rubella, or hepatitis A and B?
PATIENT: No. No idea. Those sound… complicated. She had a chart, I think. A big one. With stickers. I never looked at it. I just… drove her to the appointments. And carried the bags. I’m really bad with names and… medical things. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. It’s reminding me too much of… everything. This is hard.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Odell. It’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed, and it’s completely understandable that this is bringing up difficult emotions. We can take things slowly. Since we don't have a clear vaccination history, and you're unsure of the destination, the safest course of action would be to get a few basic vaccinations, just to be prepared. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Prepared… yeah. I guess. If it makes it easier. Safer. She always said to be prepared. I just… wish she was here to tell me what to do. Fine. Do what you think is best. I trust you. Just… please, make it quick. And don’t use too many big words. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything clearly. We’ll start with a few routine vaccinations – Tetanus booster, Hepatitis A, and Typhoid. These are generally recommended for travel to many regions, and they offer good protection against common illnesses. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… no. Not that I know of. She always asked me, but I never had anything. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes? But that was probably the dust. Or the machines. No, no allergies. Definitely not. She would have remembered. She remembered everything. But… wait. There was something. A rash, once? Years ago? When I got a cut on my hand. I don’t know what it was. It went away on its own. Is that important? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible rash with a previous injury. It's good you mentioned that. Just to be safe, we'll ask a few questions about it before we proceed with the vaccinations. Can you describe the rash?
PATIENT: Rash… it was… red. I think. And itchy. Around the cut. It wasn’t big. Just a little patch. It didn’t… bubble or anything. Just red and itchy. It happened after I fixed a plane. A small one. Something about a… fuel leak. I cleaned it up, but… then the rash showed up. My wife put some cream on it. It went away pretty quickly. I don’t remember what kind of cream. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. It wasn’t a big deal. I just… fixed things. And the rash went away. She said it was probably just the soap.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like it might have been a simple contact dermatitis – a reaction to something that irritated your skin, possibly the soap or something related to the fuel leak. Since it resolved on its own and doesn’t sound like a serious allergy, we can proceed with the vaccinations. However, I'll be extra cautious and ask you about any reactions you experience afterward. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I need to… get back to things. This is hard. It’s reminding me of too much. But if you think it’s safe, then… do it. Just… be quick, okay? And don’t use big needles. I hate needles. She always held my hand. She made it easier. But… she’s not here now. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. I understand. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll use the smallest needle available, and I’ll be right here with you the whole time. I'll explain each step as I go. Now, let's roll up your sleeve…
