DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Neppl. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, recently, things have not been… staying with me. My memory, it is… troublesome. It is new, this problem. And my blood pressure, it is… high, the doctors say. I hope we can find out what is happening.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Alvara. It sounds concerning, and we will certainly do our best to understand what’s happening. Let’s start with the memory issues. You said this is a new problem?
PATIENT: Yes, new. Perhaps… six months, maybe? It is not that I forget everything, you understand. I remember dates… numbers… very clearly. It is… the little things. What I had for breakfast. Where I put my keys. Names of… acquaintances. It is frustrating, and it worries me. It was never like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand. Distinguishing between remembering some things and struggling with others is helpful. And six months is a definite timeframe. Could you describe a typical instance where you notice this memory difficulty?
PATIENT: Just yesterday, Doctor. Mrs. Petrova, she came to discuss the garden… the flowers are lovely, you see. We talked for… fifteen minutes, perhaps? About the roses, the hydrangeas… And then, five minutes later, I could not recall what she wanted. She had to repeat herself. And she was… annoyed. It is embarrassing. I apologized, of course, but… it happens often now. Small things, but many of them.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite frustrating, Ms. Alvara, and I can understand why you're concerned. It’s good that you’re noticing these patterns. To get a more complete picture, let’s move on to your blood pressure. You mentioned other doctors have noted it is high. Do you know what your most recent reading was, or approximately what range it has been in?
PATIENT: I… believe it was 160 over 90, last time I checked. At the pharmacy, you know? They have those machines. It fluctuates, of course. Sometimes it is lower, but… it is often high. The other doctor, he said I should take… pills, but I did not want to. I prefer to… manage it myself, with diet and… rest. Is that… foolish?
DOCTOR: It's not foolish to want to explore lifestyle modifications first, Ms. Alvara. Many people prefer that approach. However, consistently high readings like 160/90 are a cause for concern and can increase your risk of serious health problems. Before we discuss potential treatment options, I’d like to gather some more information. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had a… a difficult birth, many years ago. But that was… resolved. My weight, I suppose, is a little high. 136 kilograms, I believe. I am quite tall, though – 195 centimeters. Otherwise… no. I do not take any medications regularly. And I have… no insurance. It is… difficult, you understand? To afford much care.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Alvara. It's helpful to know about the difficult birth and your weight, and I understand the challenges of affording healthcare. We’ll certainly keep that in mind as we discuss your options. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she lived to be 85, I think. She had… some problems with her heart, towards the end. Not strong, you see. My father… he died younger, from a… a stroke, I believe. And my brother… he had… diabetes, yes. And he also had problems remembering things, later in life. It was… concerning. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very important, Ms. Alvara. A family history of heart problems, stroke, and diabetes, as well as your brother’s memory issues, provides valuable context. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. I do not smoke. I… rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine on special occasions. And I certainly do not use… recreational drugs. I am a very… respectable woman. I have always been. I eat… mostly healthy foods. Fish, vegetables, some fruit. I try to avoid… processed things. And I walk… when the weather permits. It is not much, perhaps, but…
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like you lead a generally healthy lifestyle. I appreciate your honesty. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have, to medications, foods, or anything else.
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not think I have any serious allergies, Doctor. I sometimes get a… a slight rash if I touch certain flowers, but nothing severe. And… I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but that was many years ago. I avoid it now, of course. Otherwise… no. I do not have any known allergies that I am aware of. I can eat shellfish, nuts, all the common things people are allergic to. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Alvara. Knowing about the penicillin allergy is important. And good to know about no reactions to common allergens. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. Though, I confess, I do not… enjoy doctors examining me. It reminds me of… unpleasant experiences in the past. But… if it is necessary, then I will cooperate. Please… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I understand your apprehension, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. Your blood pressure is elevated, as expected. Pulse and temperature are within normal limits. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular with a slight murmur, which we’ll need to investigate further. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are a bit diminished. Now, I'd like to do a brief neurological assessment - just checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A murmur… that does not sound good, does it? And diminished breath sounds… Yes, Doctor. Please… proceed with the neurological assessment. If it is necessary. Though, I confess, I am not very good at… balance. I have always been a little clumsy. But I will try my best. Please… tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Alvara, but let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Murmurs and diminished breath sounds can have many causes, some of which are benign. We’ll investigate further to determine the cause. Your eye movements are good, and your reflexes are symmetrical, although a bit diminished. Your walk is a little unsteady, and you do have some difficulty with balance, as you mentioned. Your coordination is slightly off. Based on this brief examination, Ms. Alvara, I’m concerned about several things - your elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, diminished breath sounds, and the neurological findings. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Several things… That is… alarming. A heart murmur… neurological findings… What does that mean? Is it… serious? Is it… the memory problems? Is that what is causing them? And what about the blood pressure? Is it all connected? I… I am frightened, Doctor. What do we do now? I have no family here… no one to… help me understand. What tests do you recommend? And… how much will they cost? I… I do not know if I can afford much.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be frightened, Ms. Alvara. I’m here to help you understand and guide you through this process. It’s good that you're asking questions, and I’ll do my best to answer them honestly. It's possible that all of these findings are connected, but we need more information to determine that. The memory problems could be related to the neurological findings, but they could also be caused by other factors, such as high blood pressure, or even something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I recommend the following tests: Electrocardiogram : This test measures the electrical activity of your heart and can help identify the cause of the murmur. Blood tests: These tests will check your overall health, including your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. Complete Blood Count : This will check for anemia or other underlying conditions. Brain MRI: This imaging test will provide a detailed picture of your brain and can help identify any structural abnormalities that could be causing the memory problems. Cognitive Assessment: This test will help us understand the nature and extent of your memory problems. I understand your concern about the cost. The prices can vary, but roughly: ECG: \$100 - \$200 Blood tests: \$200 - \$500 Brain MRI: \$800 - \$2000 Cognitive Assessment: \$200 - \$400 I know this is a lot, and I want to assure you that we’ll explore all possible options to make these tests affordable. We can discuss payment plans, and I can also connect you with local resources that may be able to provide financial assistance. Given your neurological symptoms and memory issues, I also think it would be wise to consult with a neurologist. I can make a referral for you. Would you like me to proceed with ordering these tests and scheduling a neurology consult?
PATIENT: Neurologist… MRI… It is… overwhelming. And the cost… \$2000? I… I do not have that kind of money. I live on a small pension. Payment plans… financial assistance… I will try, I suppose. But… I do not want to be a burden. I do not want to run up bills I cannot pay. Yes, Doctor. Please… proceed with the tests. And the neurology consult. I… I want to know what is happening. Even if the news is bad. I need to understand. But… perhaps we could start with the least expensive tests first? The ECG and the blood tests? Just to see… what we find? And… could you tell me about this neurologist? Is he… kind? I need someone who will explain things carefully. I am… easily frightened.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable approach, Ms. Alvara. We can definitely start with the least expensive tests - the ECG and blood tests – and see what they reveal. That will give us a better idea of what further investigations are needed. I completely understand your concerns about the cost and your preference for a kind and understanding neurologist. I recommend Dr. Anya Volkov. She is a highly respected neurologist in the area and is known for her compassionate bedside manner. She takes the time to explain things carefully to her patients and is very patient with their concerns. Her office is located about 30 minutes from here, and she accepts new patients. I will provide you with her contact information and a referral note. I’ll order the ECG and blood tests for you now. The lab is located just across the street, and you can go there at your convenience. They will send the results to my office, and I will review them as soon as they are available. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce stress as much as possible and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Do you have any questions about the lab tests or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: Dr. Volkov… That sounds… good. Compassionate bedside manner… That is very important. I need someone who will… explain things carefully. The lab tests… No, I do not think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to fast beforehand? I eat breakfast quite early. And… should I avoid any strenuous activity before the tests? I walk a little each day… Is that okay? I just want to… cooperate. I want to find out what is happening.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Alvara. I understand your desire to cooperate and do everything correctly. The results for the blood tests and ECG typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I will call you as soon as they are available. Regarding preparation for the tests: Blood Tests: Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. You can have breakfast after the blood draw. ECG: No special preparation is needed for the ECG. You can eat and drink normally before the test. Walking: Continuing your normal walking routine is perfectly fine. It won’t affect the test results. I will provide you with written instructions detailing these preparations when I give you the lab order. Here is the lab order. Please take this to the lab across the street, and they will schedule your appointment. Remember, you'll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: 8-12 hours… that will be difficult. I am an early riser. But… I will manage. I always do. No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you. Thank you for… listening. And for being so patient. I… I appreciate it very much. I will go to the lab… and schedule my appointment. And I will… fast. I will do everything you have asked. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help you through this. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
