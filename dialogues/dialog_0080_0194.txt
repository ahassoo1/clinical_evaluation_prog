DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… hard to explain, really. My hearing, it goes funny sometimes. And I get really dizzy. It’s… happened a few times now. My husband, bless him, he used to get it too, so I think maybe it runs in the family. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. It's just... been happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds a bit concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. You said your hearing goes "funny" – can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not always the same. Sometimes it just feels muffled, like someone turned down the volume. Other times… it’s like everything is swirling, and I can’t make out any sounds. And it’s usually just in one ear, I think. The left one, maybe? Or was it the right? Honestly, it’s all a bit hazy. It doesn’t last long, thankfully, usually just a few hours, but it’s scary when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating hearing, sometimes muffled, sometimes complete loss, usually in one ear… and it lasts a few hours. That’s helpful. And you mentioned dizziness – is that always with the hearing loss, or does it happen separately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good question. It's usually with the hearing loss. When my hearing starts to go, that’s when the room starts spinning. Not always right away, but pretty soon after. It's a bad spin, you know? Makes me feel really sick. I have to lie down. It hasn’t happened separately… not that I remember, anyway. It's been a while since the last time, so things get a bit mixed up in my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the dizziness is associated with the hearing loss, a spinning sensation that makes you nauseous, and requires you to lie down. Do you ever experience any ringing in your ears, or a feeling of fullness in your ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe. It’s not constant, not like a loud buzzing. More like… a faint hum, sometimes. I usually just put it down to the quiet, you know? I live out a bit, away from everything. Fullness… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. It's just the spinning and the quiet. Or the muffled sounds. It all feels mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional faint humming, associated with the quiet of your environment. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking things I’m less sure about. My husband did most of the remembering when it came to doctor's things. I think I had my blood pressure checked once, and the doctor said it was a little high, but I don’t think he gave me anything for it. And no, no diabetes. I ate too many mangoes for that! I went to the doctor regularly when my husband was still around, but I haven’t been much since… it's hard going on your own, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult. Okay, so potentially elevated blood pressure in the past, but not currently managed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I broke my wrist once when I was a little girl, climbing a mango tree, but that was a long, long time ago. And I had my tonsils out when I was young, but that was just a quick thing. Nothing in recent years, definitely. My husband… he had a knee replacement a few years back, but that was him.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a broken wrist long ago, and your husband had a knee replacement. Let's talk about your family history. Did anyone in your family – parents, siblings, or children – have problems with hearing loss, dizziness, or balance issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, like I said, my husband had it! He used to get those dizzy spells constantly. The doctor said it was something to do with the little stones in his ear, or something like that. And my mother, she was always a bit unsteady on her feet when she got older. Not exactly dizziness, but she used to stumble a lot. My father… I don’t really remember him having any problems. He died when I was young.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your husband had a history of dizziness related to inner ear stones, and your mother experienced unsteadiness with age. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a little bit of paracetamol sometimes, for aches and pains. Nothing regularly. And I take a multivitamin, just to keep me going. Nothing fancy. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I try not to take too much. It’s easy to get confused.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional paracetamol and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had any bad reactions to anything. I used to eat all sorts of things when I was a little girl, mangoes, breadfruit, everything! Nothing ever bothered me. I'm a pretty simple person, you know? Don't eat much processed food, mostly just what I grow in the garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Terasa, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your ears, your balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm happy to help if I can. Just be gentle, my ears are a bit sensitive sometimes. And… don’t mind if I close my eyes, it makes me feel a bit better when someone’s close to my face.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa, everything sounds normal so far, but your hearing is a little reduced, especially on the left, and you show some mild unsteadiness. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing a condition called vestibular neuritis, which is an inflammation of the inner ear that can cause dizziness and hearing loss. However, it could also be something else, so I’d like to order some tests to be sure.
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a mouthful! Vestibular… neuritis? Is that serious, Doctor? It just feels like a nuisance, really, but I don’t want it to get worse. What sort of tests are you thinking of? I don’t want anything too complicated, if possible. My head gets a bit muddled easily.
DOCTOR: It’s not usually serious, Terasa, but it can be quite disruptive. We need to figure out the cause of your symptoms to determine the best course of action. I'm thinking of two main tests. First, an audiology test – a more detailed hearing test to assess the extent of your hearing loss. It’s painless and just involves wearing headphones and responding to sounds. The second is a VNG test, which measures eye movements to assess your inner ear function. It involves wearing goggles and following a moving target. It can sometimes cause mild dizziness, but it's usually short-lived. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goggles and moving targets… sounds a bit much, if I’m honest. The headphones I can manage, I think. But I get travel sickness easily, you know? Even looking at the waves makes me feel a bit queasy. Will the goggles make me dizzy? And how long will it take? I have a bit of a garden to look after, and I don’t want to be out of commission for too long. It’s just… all these tests sound a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Terasa. We can absolutely start with just the audiology test and see how you feel. We don’t have to do the VNG right away. The audiology test should give us a good starting point. It will take about 30-45 minutes. If the results indicate a problem with your inner ear, then we can discuss the possibility of the VNG. It’s better to take things slowly, and we’ll only do what’s necessary. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds much better, Doctor. Just the headphones to start with. That I can definitely manage. Thirty to forty-five minutes, you say? Alright, that’s fine. As long as I don’t have to lie down or anything. Thank you for understanding. It just… all this is a bit overwhelming, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. I understand it can be overwhelming. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll have the audiology technician come in and get you set up. They'll explain everything clearly, and you can ask them any questions you have. While we're waiting, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Just the hearing test, please. Thank you for being so patient with me. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I worry about forgetting things. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It's my job. And don’t worry about your memory – I’ll make sure to document everything thoroughly. I’ll just step out and get the technician, and they'll be in shortly. Let me know if you need anything at all while you wait. .
