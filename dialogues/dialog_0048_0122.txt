DOCTOR: Right. Venus Alvara, 53 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Sink. Thank you for seeing me. It is… difficult to explain, precisely. I have been… misplacing things. And forgetting… small details. It is most concerning, as I manage many properties, and such lapses are… unacceptable. It has only been recently, perhaps a month. And my blood pressure… it is not always good.
DOCTOR: Misplacing things… and forgetting details. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. Not longer than six weeks, I assure you. It is not… a gradual decline. More… sudden instances. I recall everything perfectly one moment, and the next… where did I put my keys? What was the name of the new tenant? These things. It is… unsettling. I do not wish to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Right. And you mentioned blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. My… physician, Doctor Petrov, he monitors it. It is often… elevated. He prescribes medication, of course. I take it as directed, but… it fluctuates. Sometimes I feel quite well, other times… not so much. I believe this… forgetfulness may be connected. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It could be connected. Blood pressure issues can certainly affect cognitive function. Though, frankly, at your age, these sorts of complaints are… common. Do you have a list of your current medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here. Doctor Petrov’s list. Lisinopril, ten milligrams, once daily. And… sometimes, Ibuprofen, if my joints ache. Though I try to avoid it. It does not agree with me. And a multivitamin, just a standard one. Is that sufficient information? I apologize if it is not… comprehensive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril… standard dose. Ibuprofen as needed. Noted. Any allergies, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Sink. I have no known allergies. Never have. I eat… most things. I am quite… robust, generally. Except for this… recent issue, of course. I have always prided myself on my health. It is… frustrating to feel this… cloudiness. I do not wish to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: My… husband, God rest his soul, he had… heart problems. Quite severe. He passed away five years ago. His mother, she suffered from… what the doctors called “dementia,” I believe. But it was a long time ago. I was quite young then. I do not recall many details. It was… unpleasant. My father was very healthy, though. Lived to be eighty-seven. I hope this is… helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, heart problems in the family, some potential cognitive decline… and you're experiencing recent memory lapses and fluctuating blood pressure. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor Sink. Whatever you deem necessary. I am quite compliant. Please, do not hesitate to… interrupt if I am not performing adequately. I wish to be of assistance. It is… important to me to resolve this issue.
DOCTOR: Good. Follow it with your eyes only. Now, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… It is… August. Yes, August. And… the second. August the second, 2025. Is that correct? I apologize for the hesitation. It is… unusually difficult to recall simple things at this moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, tell me the words. I will repeat them to the best of my ability. I am… quite capable, generally. Though, as you can see, not at this precise moment. Please proceed when you are ready. I am listening attentively.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Repeat those for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Is that… correct? I believe I have said them accurately. Please, inform me if I have made an error. I am anxious to… understand the results of this examination.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: The year… It is 2025. Yes, 2025. I am certain of that. Although… it feels… distant, somehow. I apologize for my… lack of composure. This is quite unsettling. Are these questions… standard procedure?
DOCTOR: Standard. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor Sink. In the clinic. An urban clinic, as I recall. I believe it is… on Elm Street. Though I am not entirely certain. It is… difficult to focus. My thoughts are… scattered. I apologize for being… imprecise. This is most concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Based on this brief assessment, and your history, it's… difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause. Your symptoms could be related to a number of factors – medication side effects, fluctuating blood pressure, or early cognitive changes. It's… too early to say definitively. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. And an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural issues. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They’ll be able to perform more in-depth cognitive testing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds entirely reasonable, Doctor Sink. Whatever you deem necessary to… ascertain the cause of this problem. Blood work, an MRI, a neurologist… I will comply with whatever recommendations you have. I simply wish to… understand what is happening. And to… resolve it, if possible. Is there… paperwork involved? And will my insurance… cover these procedures? Although, I confess… I do not currently have insurance. It is… a complicated matter.
DOCTOR: Yes, there’s paperwork. And as for insurance… well, that complicates things. Without insurance, these tests will be… quite expensive. I can provide you with a cost estimate. And we can discuss potential financial assistance programs, though I can’t guarantee anything. The neurologist may require a separate referral, and they will have their own billing procedures. I’ll have my assistant print out the necessary forms and information for you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… is quite concerning. I… did not anticipate such… significant expenses. I am a widow, Doctor Sink, and my resources are… limited. Financial assistance… I appreciate you mentioning that. I will… review the cost estimate carefully. And I will inquire about the neurology referral. Perhaps… we should focus on the blood work first? To… have a clearer understanding of the situation before… incurring further expenses? I simply wish to… proceed cautiously. This is… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with the blood work. My assistant will draw it now. And I'll get the referral to the neurologist started. Honestly, the MRI is the most important thing to rule out anything serious, but we can hold off on that for now. I'm running behind schedule, Ms. Alvara. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds satisfactory, Doctor Sink. Blood work first, then the neurology referral. I understand you are… busy. I will not… detain you any further. My assistant will… guide me to the blood draw location? I appreciate your… time and attention. And I sincerely hope we can… ascertain the cause of this problem. This… uncertainty is most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, my assistant will take care of that. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Next! .
PATIENT: .
