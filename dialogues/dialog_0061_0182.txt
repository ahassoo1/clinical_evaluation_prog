DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Mr. Orwin! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, don't bother with the "lovely to meet you" part. I haven't got all day. It's about this… procedure. The one my daughter insisted I get cleared for. Something about smoothing out some wrinkles. Frankly, I think she's making a fuss about nothing, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re here for a consultation regarding a cosmetic procedure your daughter has suggested?
PATIENT: Suggested? She practically dragged me here. Says I look “tired.” I’ve been working with terrazzo for sixty years, young lady. Of course I look tired! It’s honest work, not… whatever it is people do these days. Look, just tell me what you need to know so I can get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, I hear you, Mr. Orwin. We can definitely get through this efficiently. Just to be clear, this procedure would involve some sort of wrinkle smoothing—do you know what type of procedure your daughter had in mind?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. She used a lot of fancy words I didn’t bother to remember. Something about… injections? And a machine? Look, I just know it involves poking and prodding. And likely a hefty bill. I’m not one for these… vanities.
DOCTOR: Okay, injections and a machine… that sounds like it could be Botox or dermal fillers, possibly with a laser or micro-needling device. Do you recall if your daughter mentioned where she had the procedure done, or the name of the doctor who performed it?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. She just kept going on about how good she looked. Always about her, that one. Some fancy place downtown, I suppose. Everything she does is "fancy." Look, I don't remember details. I build floors, I don't gossip about beauty treatments. Can we just get this clearance done or not? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. Since you're unsure of the specifics, it's important for me to assess your overall health to ensure you're a suitable candidate for any procedure, and to minimize any potential risks. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. I’m eighty-one years old. What do you expect? A little arthritis, a bit of this and that. Nothing a good day’s work doesn’t fix. High blood pressure? Maybe. The doctor mentioned it once, years ago. Said to watch the salt. I mostly ignore him. No diabetes, though. I like my herring too much for that. Look, I'm a strong Norwegian man. I don't have conditions.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Orwin. It's good to know you're generally healthy and active. And it’s helpful to know about the mention of high blood pressure, even if you don’t actively manage it. Just to clarify, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like aspirin or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My daughter gives me those fish oil pills sometimes. Says it's good for my brain. And I take a little ibuprofen now and then for my back. It gets stiff after a long day on the job. Other than that, no. Just good, strong coffee. And herring. Lots of herring. Will that do?
DOCTOR: Okay, fish oil and ibuprofen occasionally. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. When I was a young man, I had my appendix out. That was… a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a roof while building a floor. Fixed it right up, though. Strong bones, you see. Other than that… no. Nothing major. I've been remarkably lucky, considering my profession. Now, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to talk about my life story all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken arm in the past. That’s helpful. Now, just a quick question about allergies – are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Herring, lefse, lutefisk… you name it. A good Norwegian man doesn’t have allergies. It’s a sign of weakness, you know. Look, I'm as tough as they come. What else do you need to know? I’m starting to feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, one last question before we move on to a quick physical exam. Do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history? My father lived to be ninety, building floors. My mother… she lived a good life. Lots of knitting, lots of herring. As far as I know, nobody keeled over from heart disease or anything fancy like that. We were a hardy bunch, you see. Strong Norwegian stock. Now, can we please get on with this? I’ve got work to do. And herring to eat.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you have a very active lifestyle and a strong family history of good health. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I haven't got all day, you know. And don't poke too hard. My skin is tough, like the terrazzo I work with. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, good. Heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148/85. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your age and activity level. Lastly, I’m going to take a quick look at your skin. Skin is firm, with some age-related changes as expected. I notice some mild sun damage, but no unusual moles or lesions. Everything seems generally good, Mr. Orwin. But your blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. Do you have a regular doctor who monitors your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? I told you, I ignore that doctor. He always wants me to change something. And sun damage? I work outdoors! Of course I have some sun damage. It's a sign of a hard day's work. Look, I'm fine. Always have been, always will be. So, can I get this clearance or not? I've got floors to build and herring to eat. And I'm starting to feel very impatient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. I understand your reluctance, but given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I'm not comfortable providing full clearance for an elective cosmetic procedure at this time. It’s not that I think you can't have it, but undergoing a procedure could potentially raise your blood pressure further, which isn't ideal. I recommend you see your primary care physician for a blood pressure check and a general health assessment. Once your blood pressure is well-controlled, we can revisit this discussion. I can document my findings and recommendations for your daughter's doctor, if you'd like. This will explain why I'm recommending a medical check-up before proceeding. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: So you're saying I can't get it done? After all this fuss? Honestly! My daughter is going to be furious. Fine. Document whatever you need to. But don't expect me to be back. I’ll just ignore her. I always do. And I'll continue building floors and eating my herring. It's a perfectly good life without fancy procedures. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’ll document my findings and recommendations for your daughter. I understand your frustration. I will also provide you with a printed summary of our conversation, including the recommendation to follow up with your primary care physician. I wish you all the best with your floor building and herring eating! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you change your mind or have any questions in the future. .
