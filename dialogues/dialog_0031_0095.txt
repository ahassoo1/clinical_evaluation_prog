DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s…my hearing. Went suddenly on one side. And my face feels…droopy, I suppose. It happened yesterday morning. It’s very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are certainly concerning. “Inconvenient” isn't quite the word I'd use, but I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. Let's gather some more information. First, regarding the hearing loss – was it a complete loss all at once, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, does it matter? It just was. One minute I could hear perfectly fine, the next…nothing. Like someone flipped a switch. It wasn’t a slow fade, if that's what you’re getting at. It was…immediate. Really, I don’t have time for a detailed timeline of my ear. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize if my questions seem detailed. It’s simply important to rule out different possibilities. Immediate onset is, indeed, significant. Okay. And you mentioned facial drooping. On which side of your face is that occurring?
PATIENT: Over there. On this side. It’s…difficult to describe. Everything just feels…weak. Like it’s going to slide off. It's rather embarrassing, actually. I had to re-do my makeup twice this morning.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this weakness affected your ability to speak or swallow?
PATIENT: Well, I'm talking to you, aren’t I? I can speak perfectly well, thank you. And I had lunch earlier, didn’t have any trouble with that either. Though the salad wasn't very good. Really, are you asking me about my lunch now? This is ridiculous. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Nissenbaum. You are right to question me. I am just trying to ascertain the extent of the issue. It's good to hear you haven't experienced difficulty speaking or swallowing. To get a better understanding, I would like to perform a brief neurological exam. It will involve checking your facial movements, strength, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Must you? Really, I haven't got all day. What exactly does poking and prodding accomplish? I assure you, I'm perfectly healthy aside from this…affliction. But, fine. Get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your impatience, and I will be as quick as possible. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes – just look at it as I move it. Then, I will ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. Finally, I'll check your strength. First, follow my finger... good. Now, smile for me. Okay. And now, raise your eyebrows as high as you can. Close your eyes tightly. Now, stick out your tongue. Okay. Thank you. Now, I'd like to listen to your ears and check your balance.
PATIENT: Honestly, it feels like I'm in some sort of…play. Very demeaning. But, go ahead. Get it over with. Just…be gentle, alright? I have important events this week. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Everything looks clear in your ears, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now, I'm going to briefly check your balance. I'm going to ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Okay. Please open your eyes. Based on what you've told me, and the findings from this brief exam, I am concerned about the possibility of Bell's palsy. It is a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, and it can cause sudden weakness on one side of the face and hearing loss. However, we need to rule out other causes. I would like to order an MRI to confirm the diagnosis and ensure there isn't anything else going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? More poking and prodding? And waiting? Really. You mean more of this? Is this going to require a referral? Because frankly, I don’t have time for endless specialists. And what exactly does this “Bell’s palsy” entail? Is it…serious? I need a straight answer, Doctor. None of this…vague medical jargon. And will it affect my appearance? That's my primary concern, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Yes, an MRI will require a referral. I will recommend a colleague, Dr. Anya Sharma, who has excellent availability and a very efficient imaging center. Bell's palsy isn’t typically serious, but it can be quite debilitating. It's caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which controls movement of the face, taste, and tear production. Most people recover fully within a few weeks to months with treatment, which typically involves corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Regarding your appearance, it can cause facial weakness, making it difficult to smile, close your eye, or even eat and drink. This can be temporary, but it's understandable that you're concerned. The severity varies greatly from person to person. It’s important to start treatment as soon as possible to maximize your chances of a full recovery. The MRI will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, like a stroke or a tumor, which are less common but need to be excluded. Would you like me to arrange the referral for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Arrange the referral. But I expect a quick appointment. And Dr. Sharma had better be efficient. Honestly, the thought of my face being…weak…it’s simply dreadful. Can’t I just get some medication now? Something to…calm the nerve? Before it gets any worse? I have a charity gala next week, Doctor. Next week. This is a disaster. Just…get it done. Quickly. And send me the results as soon as they’re available. Don’t make me chase you. I have important things to do. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’ve just submitted the referral to Dr. Sharma’s office. They will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I’ve also made a note on the referral request that it is urgent, given your charity gala next week. I can prescribe a short course of corticosteroids – prednisone – to help reduce inflammation while we await the MRI results. It’s a standard treatment for Bell's palsy. However, it’s important to understand that it doesn’t guarantee a full recovery, and it does have potential side effects. I will provide you with detailed instructions on how to take it, as well as a list of potential side effects to watch out for. Here is the prescription. Please fill it as soon as possible. I will personally follow up with Dr. Sharma's office to ensure they receive the request promptly, and I will contact you as soon as the MRI results are available. In the meantime, please protect your eye on the affected side – use artificial tears to keep it moist, and consider wearing an eye patch at night to prevent injury. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
