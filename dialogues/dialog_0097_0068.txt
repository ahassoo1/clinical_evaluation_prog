DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. It started after… after the cancer treatment. I had it a while ago now, but the swelling just won’t go down. It’s a bit bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha, that’s good information to start with. Swelling after cancer treatment can be a bit complex, so it’s good you’re getting it checked out. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was… a long time ago. Let me think. It was… radiation, I think? And some… pills. Lots of pills. They made me very sick, to be honest. It was at the hospital, of course. The big hospital downtown. I don’t remember the name of the pills, I’m sorry. So many things happening…
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Sasha, it was a long time ago and treatment can be quite overwhelming. Just knowing it was radiation and pills is helpful. And it's perfectly alright if you don’t remember specifics. Now, about the swelling… When did you first notice it after your treatment ended?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It wasn’t right away. Maybe… a few months after? No, longer. Six months, maybe even a year. It started slowly, just a little puffiness, and I didn’t think much of it at first. Thought it was just from sitting too long. But it’s gotten bigger since then. It’s mostly in my left leg, the one I… well, the one they treated.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling developed gradually, starting about six months to a year after treatment, and it’s primarily in your left leg, the leg that received the radiation. Is it constant swelling, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, yes. Some days it’s worse than others, of course. If I sit for too long, it gets really bad. And if it’s hot, it swells up even more! It's not painful, really, just… uncomfortable. Heavy, you know? Like a big weight.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, “heavy” is a good way to describe it. And it's good to know it’s not particularly painful, but more of a discomfort. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your left leg?
PATIENT: Changes? Um… let me see. It’s a little… darker, maybe? And a bit thicker than my other leg. I hadn’t really thought about it until you asked. It doesn't itch or anything, just… different. A little rough feeling, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slightly darker and thicker skin texture, feeling a bit rough to the touch. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you had any problems with blood clots in the past?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh, goodness, no. Not that I know of. I’ve never had any surgery, except for… well, a tonsillectomy when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago! No, I don’t think so. I'd remember something like that, wouldn't I? It sounds awful.
DOCTOR: You absolutely would remember, Sasha, and a tonsillectomy wouldn't typically cause that. Good to know there’s no history of clots. And just to be thorough, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Um, my blood pressure is a little high, the doctor told me. I take a pill for that, every morning. And… well, my arthritis is acting up, but that’s just old age, I think! Other than that… no, not really. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis. That's good information. And it's great that you're staying active despite the arthritis. What about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. The blood pressure pill… I think it’s called… Amlodipine? Yes, that’s it! And sometimes I take something for the arthritis, when it gets really bad, but just over-the-counter stuff, like ibuprofen. And… that's it, I think. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. That’s good to know. Now, Sasha, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your leg. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want this swelling to go away, it’s getting a bit tiresome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Sasha. I’m noting some swelling in your lower left leg, primarily around the calf and ankle. The skin is slightly darker and feels a bit thicker compared to your right leg, as you mentioned. The pulses in your foot are present and feel normal. I don’t feel any significant warmth or tenderness. I’m also noting some mild discoloration of the skin. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have lymphedema, which is swelling caused by a build-up of fluid due to damage to the lymphatic system. Radiation therapy can sometimes cause this as a long-term side effect. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities like a blood clot, I’d like to order a couple of tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lymp-what? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Radiation… yes, that makes sense, I suppose. I just want it fixed. Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Just tell me what I need to do. It doesn't sound very pleasant, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound pleasant, but they're relatively straightforward. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your leg to check for blood clots and assess the blood flow. I’ll also order a lymphoscintigraphy, which is a scan to look at the lymphatic system and see how well it’s working. The nurse will schedule those for you before you leave. They will give you instructions on how to prepare for each one. The ultrasound doesn’t require any special preparation, but the lymphoscintigraphy will require an injection. In the meantime, I’d recommend elevating your leg as much as possible, especially when you’re sitting or lying down. Light exercise, like walking, can also help. Do you have any compression socks?
PATIENT: Compression… socks? Oh, goodness, no. I don’t think so. I have lots of regular socks, of course, but… special ones? No. My daughter, she wears those things, for her travel, I think. But I’ve never had any myself. Elevating it… yes, I can do that. It's just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. Compression socks can be very helpful for lymphedema. They help to push fluid out of your leg and reduce swelling. I’m going to write you a prescription for a pair, and the nurse can direct you to a store where you can get them fitted properly. It's important to get the right size for them to work effectively. And we'll go over the results of the tests as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. A prescription… alright. Yes, that would be helpful. It all sounds… a bit much, to be honest. But I trust you. Hmm… questions… Well, will this… will this go away, eventually? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Sasha. It's understandable to be concerned. Lymphedema is a chronic condition, meaning it often doesn't go away completely. However, it can be managed very effectively with treatment. The goal is to control the swelling and prevent it from getting worse. It's not typically "serious" in the sense of being life-threatening, but if left untreated, it can lead to complications like skin infections or decreased mobility. That's why it’s good we're addressing it now. With compression socks, elevation, and regular exercise, many people are able to live full and active lives with lymphedema. We may also consider referral to a lymphedema therapist who can teach you specific exercises and techniques to help manage the swelling. We’ll discuss all of that as we get the test results and see how you respond to initial treatment. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: A therapist… alright. That sounds… helpful. I suppose. It's just… a lot to take in. No, I think that's all for now, Doctor. I just want to go home and put my leg up. Thank you for explaining everything, you’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. It is a lot to take in, and you're right to want to rest and elevate your leg. The nurse will come in shortly to give you the prescriptions and schedule the tests. She can also answer any further questions you may have. Here's a written summary of everything we discussed today, including the instructions for elevating your leg and the information about lymphedema. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions before your next appointment. Get some rest, Sasha, and we’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. Take care. .
