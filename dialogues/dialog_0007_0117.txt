DOCTOR: Hi Devin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Doc. It's... a cough. Been coughin' up stuff. Not just regular stuff, you know? There's... red in it. Blood. I smoke, see. Been smokin' a long time. That got somethin' to do with it, I guess. I just want to get it checked. Don't really... don't really remember much else about it right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. A cough with some blood in it – that definitely warrants checking out, especially with your smoking history. Don't worry, we'll figure out what's going on. Let me just pull up your records here... Okay, Devin Reyno, 54 years old. Good. And you said this has been happening... when did you first notice the blood in your cough?
PATIENT: Uh... when? Gosh. Not long ago, I don't think. Maybe... a week? Two weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Some days it's just a little bit, other days... more. I don't really keep track of things like that. Sorry. It's hard to remember. Medicare covers this, right? I got that card with me somewhere...
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Devin. Don't worry about remembering exact dates, we'll get there. And yes, Medicare should cover this. We'll verify everything with the billing department, you don’t need to worry about that right now. Okay, so a week or two of coughing up blood... and is it just when you cough, or do you notice any blood when you, say, brush your teeth, or have a nosebleed?
PATIENT: Just when I cough. Definitely just when I cough. I haven't... no nosebleeds or anything. And my teeth are fine, I think. I go to the dentist… sometimes. Not much else happens. I get tired easy, but I always have. Old age, I guess. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do later.
DOCTOR: Okay, just with the cough. And you've noticed fatigue for a while now. Alright. We'll try to be as quick as possible, Devin. But it's important to get a good understanding of what's going on, so I'm going to ask a few more questions, then I’ll want to listen to your lungs and do a quick physical exam. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever... not that I know of. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I don't bother with thermometers. Chills… not really. Night sweats… I always sleep kinda warm, so… hard to tell. I don't really pay attention to stuff like that. Look, is this serious? Is it somethin' bad? I just want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Devin. It's good you're getting this checked out. Coughing up blood always needs to be investigated. It could be something serious, but it could also be something less concerning. That’s why we need to do some tests. I don't want to jump to any conclusions before we have more information. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything else – like pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, or COPD?
PATIENT: COPD… I think the doc said somethin’ about that once. Years ago. When I was coughin’ real bad. But I don’t really remember all the details. I just know I got pills. Took ‘em for a while, then stopped. Didn't seem to do much good. Asthma, no. Pneumonia… maybe once, a long time ago. They gave me shots. Honestly, I get all these doctors mixed up. They all say the same things. Is this gonna involve a lot of tests? I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible COPD diagnosis in the past. That's helpful to know. And it's understandable that you don't like hospitals or a lot of tests. We'll try to keep things as minimal as possible, but we do need to get some information to figure out what’s going on. Let's move on to your smoking history. How much do you smoke, and for how long have you been smoking?
PATIENT: Ugh. How long… a long time. Since I was… eighteen, maybe? Longer. A pack a day, usually. Sometimes more when I'm stressed. I try to cut back sometimes, but... it's hard. Been smokin’ a long time, Doc. A long time. And I worked around a lot of dust, too. Construction work. Is that bad? This is makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pack a day for many years, and a history of dust exposure from construction work. That’s definitely relevant, Devin. Both smoking and dust exposure can contribute to lung problems. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any recent weight loss, loss of appetite, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Weight loss… maybe a little. But I ain't been eatin’ much lately. Not feelin’ hungry. Chest pain… sometimes. A little ache. Not sharp or nothin’. Just… uncomfortable. Happens when I cough real hard, I think. Everything hurts when I cough hard. Can we just… get this over with? I got a bingo game tonight. Important one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. A little weight loss, loss of appetite, and some chest discomfort with coughing. We are getting there. Alright, I’m going to listen to your lungs and do a quick exam. It shouldn’t take long. Then, depending on what I hear, we may need to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray… ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can go to bingo. I hate hospitals. And doctors. No offense, Doc. But just… hurry, okay? This is makin' my head hurt.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Devin. I completely understand your anxiety. We'll be as quick as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your lungs now. I do hear some wheezing, especially on the lower right side. There’s also some diminished breath sounds in that area. And I can feel a slight vibration when you cough. Pulse is a little elevated, but blood pressure is stable. I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Okay, oxygen is a little low at 92%. Given what I'm hearing and your symptoms, I think a chest X-ray is definitely the next step. It will help us see what's going on in your lungs and rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. X-ray. Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just… tell me if it's somethin' bad. I don't want to be surprised. Is it cancer? I always worry about cancer. My uncle… he had cancer. Just tell me straight, Doc. No beatin' around the bush. I can handle it. I think. Just… hurry up with the X-ray. Bingo starts soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. I understand your concern, and I appreciate you being so direct. I promise I’ll be straight with you. It’s too early to say whether it’s cancer or not. An X-ray will give us a much clearer picture, and we’ll discuss the results thoroughly. We can't jump to any conclusions before we have the images. I’m going to have the nurse set up an X-ray for you right away. It will only take a few minutes. After the X-ray, we’ll wait for the radiologist to read the images, and then we’ll discuss the results together. In the meantime, I'm going to order a sputum sample to be sent to the lab to check for any infection. It's a simple test – you just cough up some saliva into a cup. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Saliva… yeah, okay. I can cough up some saliva. Easy enough. Just… get it over with. I really gotta go. Bingo… it's important. This is makin' me nervous. Cancer… ugh. Just… hurry. Please. I don’t like bein’ here. And tell me straight, Doc. No sugarcoatin' nothin'. Just tell me what's wrong. Or what you think is wrong. That's all I ask. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. I understand. We’ll get everything done as quickly as possible. I'll personally review the results with you as soon as they're available, and I promise to be straight with you, no sugarcoating. Nurse, could you please prepare Devin Reyno for a chest X-ray and collect a sputum sample?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Devin. The nurse will be with you shortly. Just try to relax, and we’ll get through this together. .
