DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this… discoloration, really. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, it’s not something I’ve ever dealt with before. I keep very good care of my skin, you understand, and I’m quite particular. It just… appeared.
DOCTOR: “Quite particular,” you say. Yes, I understand. And where exactly is this discoloration, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Well, it’s on my hands, mostly. And a bit on my forearms. It’s not… a rash, exactly. More like… patches. Uneven coloring. You wouldn’t notice it immediately, probably. But I do. And it’s spreading, I think. It’s… distressing.
DOCTOR: Spreading, you say. And how long have you noticed these patches, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I believe, around the end of June. So, about five or six weeks now. At first, I thought it was just… the sun. But I always wear sunscreen, Doctor. A very high factor, naturally. It just doesn’t make sense. And it’s getting… darker, I suppose. A sort of brownish tinge. It’s not pleasant.
DOCTOR: A brownish tinge, despite diligent sunscreen use. Interesting. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Not really. My husband and I haven’t travelled anywhere. My diet is the same, I suppose. Though, Mrs. Kowalski did give us some plums from her garden. Quite lovely plums, actually. But I don’t see how plums could cause… this. I haven’t started any new soaps or lotions, either. I’ve been using the same things for years. Everything is very… routine.
DOCTOR: Plums… unlikely, Ms. Bartock. Routine is good, of course, but sometimes the smallest changes can be… impactful. Now, let’s move on to a more thorough examination. Would you mind if I take a look at your hands and forearms?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though, I doubt you’ll see anything significant. It’s really quite subtle, you know. But please, do go ahead. I do hope it's nothing… serious. I have a very busy schedule, you understand, and I simply haven’t the time for… complications.
DOCTOR: Please, extend your hands, palms up. And then we'll take a look at the forearms. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. Uneven pigmentation, particularly on the dorsal surfaces. And some slight mottling on the forearms. No scaling, no blistering, no obvious inflammation. Is it itchy, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That’s what’s so perplexing! It doesn’t feel like anything. No irritation, no burning, no… anything. It’s simply… there. It’s quite annoying, frankly. It feels perfectly normal, but looks… decidedly not normal. I’ve tried a few creams, you know, just simple moisturizers, but they haven’t done a thing. Honestly, Doctor, I thought you’d see something… obvious.
DOCTOR: The lack of pruritus is… notable. And the failure of simple emollients is not surprising, given its presentation. Now, Ms. Bartock, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions. Have you noticed any fatigue, weight loss, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that. Perfectly normal energy levels, I assure you. I do Pilates three times a week, you see. And my appetite is… robust. I enjoy my food. And no weight loss whatsoever. I maintain a very consistent weight. It’s… perplexing, isn’t it? I really don’t understand what could be causing this. It’s simply… a cosmetic issue, I presume? Perhaps a new type of pigmentation? Though I’ve never heard of anything like it.
DOCTOR: “Simply a cosmetic issue?
PATIENT: Well, isn’t it? I mean, it’s not painful. It’s not… debilitating. It’s just… unsightly. I don’t want to cause a fuss, Doctor. I just want it gone. I suppose I was hoping for a simple cream or lotion. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I've wasted perfectly good time coming here. It's not like I'm ill, you know. It's just a bit of discoloration.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, with all due respect, dismissing a new symptom as "just discoloration" is not advisable. While it may be benign, we must rule out other possibilities. Now, have you noticed any unusual moles or skin lesions anywhere on your body recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Now you're frightening me. Moles? No! I have a few, naturally, but they haven't changed. I get them checked regularly, you know. My dermatologist is very thorough. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I simply have a bit of uneven coloring on my hands. I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. This is… very unsettling. Perhaps I should have just stayed home and applied some self-tanner? It would have been far less stressful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I understand your frustration, but your dismissive attitude is hindering a proper assessment. We need to consider all possibilities. Now, to be thorough, and for documentation purposes, have you had any recent exposure to unusual chemicals, plants, or irritants?
PATIENT: Oh, really. Unusual chemicals? Good heavens, no! I wouldn’t touch unusual chemicals. I’m a librarian, Doctor, not a chemist! I handle books, that’s all. And plants? I have a few orchids, perfectly normal orchids. I assure you, I haven’t been wrestling with poison ivy. This is… frankly, a bit insulting. I came here because I thought you might have a simple solution, not to be interrogated about hypothetical encounters with… vegetation. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to regret coming at all. It's wasting both our time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I am attempting to gather a comprehensive history. Your insistence that this is simply a cosmetic issue is… concerning. Given your… lack of cooperation and your dismissal of potential causes, I recommend a referral to a dermatologist for a biopsy. This is the most responsible course of action to rule out any underlying pathology. I will provide you with a referral note immediately. Do you have any allergies I should note for the dermatologist?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens. Just… dust, I suppose. A mild sensitivity. But nothing serious. Honestly, a biopsy? Really? This is… excessive. I still maintain it's just discoloration. But… very well. If you insist. Just… please don’t make it too complicated. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. And I truly hope it’s nothing… serious. This is… quite disruptive. Is there anything else you need to know? Just get it over with, please. I'm wasting valuable time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the referral note for Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly respected dermatologist. She's located downtown. I've noted your concern about a busy schedule, and she will hopefully accommodate that. I'm also going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just as a baseline. Please schedule the appointment and the lab work as soon as possible. If you experience any changes in your condition - any itching, blistering, or changes in the size or color of the discoloration - please contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. A dermatologist and… blood work. Honestly. It seems… rather extreme for a bit of uneven coloring. But… very well. I’ll schedule the appointment. Although I still think it's a waste of time. And frankly, I find your attitude rather… condescending. But thank you… I suppose. I’ll be going now. I have a library board meeting this afternoon. And I trust this won’t take too long? Really, a biopsy… for discoloration. Ridiculous.
