DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin' me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. Comes and goes, but it's been pretty consistent the last week or so. Feels like pressure, almost. And it doesn't seem to be worse with light or noise, which is good, I suppose. I've tried taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don't seem to do much good, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull, consistent ache at the back of your head for about a week now, not worsened by light or noise, and the over-the-counter medications aren't helping much. I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Now, when you say it "comes and goes", about how often would you say it's happening throughout the day?
PATIENT: Let me see… it's not constant constant, you understand? Like, it's not there every single minute. But I'd say… maybe three or four times a day it flares up. Lasts for… oh, maybe half an hour each time, sometimes a bit longer. Then it eases off again for a while. It's hard to say exactly, really. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so three or four times a day, lasting around half an hour each time. That gives me a better picture. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these headaches, or do they just come on randomly?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… I haven’t noticed anything specific. I’ve been doing my usual things, you know? Gardening, a bit of walking, spending time with my wife. No big changes in my routine. I did help my grandson move some boxes last weekend, but that wasn't anything too strenuous. It didn't start during the move, though. Just started a few days after.
DOCTOR: Alright, no clear triggers, and it started a few days after helping your grandson move. That's helpful to know. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, no. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no fever or anything like that. No stiffness in my neck. I haven't been feeling sick to my stomach. Just the headache, really. And maybe a little tired, but I'm 87, Doctor! A little tiredness comes with the territory, you know?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right about that! A little tiredness is perfectly normal. Okay, no other symptoms besides the headache and a bit of fatigue. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with some medication. I stopped taking the pills a while ago, though, because he said it was fine. Apart from that… not much, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No major illnesses or surgeries.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, controlled blood pressure in the past, now off medication. Do you remember the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… now, my wife is better with names than I am. It was a little white pill… I think it started with an 'A'? Am… amlodipine? Is that right? Or something close to that. I’m really not sure, to be honest. It was a long time ago. I just remember taking it every day.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is a good possibility. No worries at all about not remembering exactly; it was a while ago. Okay, so potentially amlodipine in the past. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife sometimes makes me try new foods, and I eat just about anything she puts in front of me! No allergies at all. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just my usual cup of tea in the morning! <stage>I smile.</stage I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it, you know? I try to eat a healthy diet and get a bit of exercise, and that’s usually enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. That's very good. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, a very strong woman. My father died when he was in his 70s, heart trouble, I think. And my sister, she’s still alive, but she’s had a bit of trouble with arthritis. No history of headaches or anything like that, really. Just the usual things, you know? Heart trouble and arthritis. Nothing too serious, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother lived to 92, father died in his 70s of heart trouble, sister has arthritis. No family history of headaches. Now, before we proceed, just one more question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of that for me! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink of alcohol in… well, decades! My wife and I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but we stopped years ago. And recreational drugs? Oh, goodness no! <stage>I chuckle softly.</stage I'm a simple man, Doctor. Just tea and gardening!
DOCTOR: Excellent. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. That’s very good. Alright, Mr. Popova, thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement completely. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 148/82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Strength is good in all extremities, reflexes are normal, and coordination appears intact. I'm also going to palpate your neck muscles to assess for tenderness. There's some mild tenderness on palpation here, but no significant muscle spasms. Okay, Mr. Popova, everything seems relatively normal, but the mild tenderness in your neck muscles and the slightly elevated blood pressure are worth noting.
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s interesting. I do sometimes feel a bit stiff in my neck, especially after gardening. I thought it was just my age, you know? And my wife does nag me about getting my blood pressure checked more often. <stage>I chuckle softly.</stage What do you think it could be, Doctor? Do you think it's something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it's unlikely to be anything serious, Mr. Popova. The most likely explanation is tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck, exacerbated by activities like gardening. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing to it, or it could be a separate issue that we should monitor. Given your age and history, I wouldn't immediately jump to more concerning causes. However, to be on the safe side, I'd like to order a few simple tests. Would you be alright with a blood test to check your complete blood count, kidney function, and thyroid levels?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to have the blood tests if you think it's best. I trust your judgement. I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know? What exactly will the tests show? And will it be a lot of needles? I don't mind a little poke, but I'm not overly fond of needles.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to want to be cautious, Mr. Popova. And you're not alone in disliking needles! The blood tests will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health. The complete blood count will check for any signs of infection or anemia. Kidney function tests will help us assess how well your kidneys are working. And thyroid levels will rule out any thyroid problems that could be contributing to your symptoms. It's just a standard blood draw, so it won’t be a lot of needles – just one or two vials. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it should be relatively quick and painless. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend trying some simple measures at home. Would you be willing to try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and apply a warm compress to your neck muscles?
PATIENT: Yes, I can certainly try those things, Doctor. Warm compress sounds good. My wife always says a warm bath helps with everything! And I'll give the ibuprofen a go, though they don’t always seem to do much good, to be honest. <stage>I shrug slightly.</stage But I'm happy to try anything. And I'll try to take it easy in the garden for a bit. <stage>I pause, considering.</stage When do you think I'll get the results of the blood tests? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Warm baths are a great idea too! And yes, please let me know if the ibuprofen doesn’t provide much relief. The blood tests usually take a couple of days to come back, so I anticipate having the results by Thursday. I'll give the clinic a call as soon as they're available. And yes, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and decide on a plan. How does next Tuesday afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Next Tuesday afternoon sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. That gives me plenty of time to rest up and hopefully feel a bit better. <stage>I smile warmly.</stage Thank you for taking such good care of me. I feel much better just knowing what might be causing it. <stage>I shift slightly in the chair.</stage Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should be watching out for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. In the meantime, please continue with the warm compresses and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. And just keep an eye out for any worsening symptoms, such as a severe headache, fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or numbness. If you experience any of those, please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, just try to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activities. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I'll see you next Tuesday afternoon. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient with all my questions. <stage>I stand up slowly, leaning on my cane for support.</stage Thank you again for your time and kindness. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was my pleasure. Please take care, and I'll see you next Tuesday. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Have a good day!
