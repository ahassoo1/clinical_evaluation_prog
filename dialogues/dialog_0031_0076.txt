DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. They're on my shins, both of ‘em. And they hurt, kinda like a really bad bruise, you know? They’re red, and… well, they’re not going away.
DOCTOR: I see. Bumps on both shins that are painful and red, and haven't resolved. That’s helpful. When did you first notice these bumps, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been a few weeks now, maybe a month? It started with just one, I think. I didn't think much of it at first, figured I bumped into something. But then more showed up, and they just… stayed. It’s been hot lately too, maybe that has something to do with it? I work outside sometimes, you know. Lifting and moving things.
DOCTOR: A month or so, starting with one bump and gradually more appearing. And you do some work outdoors, involving lifting and moving. Okay. Are the bumps appearing after specific activities, or do they seem to come and go regardless?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don’t think so, not really. They don't seem to come right after I work, but… I do a lot of walking too, back and forth, back and forth. Maybe after a long day, they feel a little worse? But I can’t say for sure if it's the walking or just… time. It's hard to tell, you know? Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly not old age, Mr. Aluia. We'll figure this out. It’s good you’re paying attention to whether they correlate with activity. So, they seem to be consistently present, and perhaps a little worse after longer days on your feet. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think again. No, not really. No fever, no… swelling anywhere else. Just the bumps. They itch a little sometimes, but not bad. Not enough to keep me up at night or anything. I put some lotion on them, but that doesn’t seem to help much. Is that important, Doctor? The itching?
DOCTOR: Itching is good to know. Even mild itching can be a clue. No fever or swelling, and the lotion isn't providing relief. Alright. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it, every day. And… arthritis, in my knees mostly. That's why I walk a lot, gotta keep ‘em moving. Other than that… nothing much. I think. My wife usually keeps track of all that stuff. She's better at remembering things than I am. Is the arthritis important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re keeping active with your knees. And yes, both the high blood pressure and arthritis are important to know. What is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don't remember the name exactly. It’s a little white pill, I think. I've been taking it for… oh, a long time now. Maybe ten years? My wife gets it filled for me, she knows the name. It's at home, in the kitchen, in a little pill organizer. I'm sorry I don't know, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Aluia. We can often find that information in your medical records. Do you recall if you’ve ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine matters?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix taken out when I was young. A long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm, falling off a ladder. I was fixing the roof. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing serious. Mostly just bumps and bruises, you know?
DOCTOR: Appendix removed and a broken arm in the past. Okay. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one… My mother had… diabetes, I think. And my father had… heart trouble, maybe? They both lived a long life, though. They weren't really ones for going to the doctor much. It was different back then, you know? They just… toughed things out. My wife's family… they're pretty healthy, I think. No real big problems that I know of.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Diabetes and heart trouble in your family, and generally good health on your wife’s side. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. Never. My wife always asks when they give me something new, but I always tell her, no allergies. I think I would know if I was allergic to something, right?
DOCTOR: You certainly would. Okay, Mr. Aluia, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to take a look at the bumps on your shins. Would you mind if I examined your legs?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead, Doctor. They're right here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. I see the bumps you're referring to. They appear to be approximately one to two centimeters in diameter, raised, and somewhat firm. There is some surrounding redness, but no significant warmth or drainage at this time. I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your legs. Do they feel painful when I touch them?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not too bad, but I can feel it. It’s kinda like a… ache. And when I bend my foot, it pulls a little on ‘em. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, I appreciate you letting me know. Based on what you’ve told me and what I've observed, these bumps could be a number of things. One possibility is shin splints, especially given your activity level and the discomfort when bending your foot. Another possibility, though less likely without other symptoms, is a form of dermatitis or a localized reaction. To rule out other causes and get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your inflammatory markers and a complete blood count. I’d also like to get a D-dimer test to rule out any blood clot issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Hmm… okay, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. I don't really like needles, but… if it will help find out what's wrong, then go ahead. My wife will be glad too, she’s always telling me to get checkups. What does the D-dimer test do, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Aluia. The D-dimer test is a simple blood test that helps us rule out blood clots in your legs. It's a precaution, given the location of the bumps and the discomfort you've described, but it’s unlikely to be a clot. The other tests will help us look for signs of inflammation or other underlying conditions. I'll write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to draw the blood quickly. After the results come back – usually within a day or two – we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible and avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Rest and no strenuous activity… I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear me say that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could help. Here’s the lab order. If you have any trouble finding the lab or if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased pain, swelling, redness, or fever – please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. We'll follow up with you as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and try to take it easy.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too. .
