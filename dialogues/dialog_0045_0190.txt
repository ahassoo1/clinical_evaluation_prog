DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor Billman. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, you see. Like I might fall over. It’s been happening for… well, I don’t quite recall how long, precisely. A while, I think.
DOCTOR: “A while” isn’t terribly helpful, unfortunately. Can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You are right, of course. I apologize. Let me think… It started, I believe, shortly after… after my husband passed. August of last year, perhaps? Or was it… the spring? It’s all rather muddled, I’m afraid. I do try to keep track, but things… slip my mind. It hasn't been constant since then, but it’s been more frequent lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a year, give or take. And it’s been getting worse recently. Can you describe what this unsteadiness feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to describe. Not dizziness, exactly. It's more like my feet aren't quite there. Like they aren't properly connected to the floor, if that makes any sense? And sometimes, things seem to… sway, even when they shouldn’t. It’s unsettling, to say the least. It doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does, I have to hold onto something, or I’m quite certain I would fall.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, not spinning, but a feeling of instability, like your feet aren’t firmly planted. And visual swaying. Do you notice anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me see… I believe it’s worse when I’m tired. Working long shifts… it certainly doesn’t help. And… crowded places. Lots of movement around me makes it significantly worse. It’s quite overwhelming, and I feel even more off-balance. I work on the rigs, so there is a fair bit of noise and activity, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: So fatigue and crowded, stimulating environments exacerbate the issue. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think… Sometimes, I feel a little… foggy. Not a headache, exactly, but a sort of… mental slowness. And… occasionally, I have trouble remembering things. Though, as you know, that's not entirely new. But it seems a bit worse when I'm feeling unsteady. Oh, and my vision feels a bit blurry at times, but I thought that was just from staring at things for so long at work.
DOCTOR: Right. Foggy thinking, some memory issues, and blurry vision. Are you experiencing any ringing in your ears, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no ringing in my ears. And thankfully, no nausea or vomiting. Just… the unsteadiness and the other things I mentioned. It’s more… disconcerting than anything. It’s frightening to feel so… disconnected, you understand? It makes it difficult to concentrate, even when I’m not working.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's... a difficult question. I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time, truthfully. My husband, he always handled those things. I... I don't recall any significant medical problems. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. I do take a multivitamin, if that counts. And I had a surgery when I was quite young, on my… appendix, I believe it was. But that was many years ago. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no significant past medical history that you’re aware of, childhood illnesses, a multivitamin, and an appendectomy years ago. Any family history of neurological problems – things like stroke, Parkinson's, dementia, multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history... That's a difficult one. My mother… she had some memory issues towards the end of her life, but we never knew exactly what it was. She just… faded away, slowly. And my father… he was very healthy, as far as I know. No stroke or Parkinson’s. I don’t believe anyone in my family had… multiple sclerosis, no. It’s a rather… somber topic, isn't it? My family… we didn’t discuss those things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, mother with some memory issues, father healthy. Now, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Social history. Well... as you know, I'm widowed. My husband passed last year. I live alone. I work, as I mentioned, on the oil rigs. Long hours, as you can imagine. I don't really have many hobbies, to be honest. It's mostly work and… trying to keep things tidy. I don’t drink alcohol and I’ve never smoked. Is that what you’re looking for? It's a rather lonely existence, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. No alcohol or tobacco use. Long hours at work, widowed. And finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. And no food allergies or anything like that. I used to have a bit of hay fever as a child, but that cleared up years ago. I'm quite… unremarkable, really. A bit unsteady, perhaps, but otherwise… quite ordinary. I apologize for being so vague. It's just… difficult to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. We'll start with your vital signs, and then I'll check your neurological function – balance, reflexes, coordination – and do a basic eye exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor Billman. I trust your judgment completely. I’m ready whenever you are. I do hope it won't take too long; I have a shift starting rather early tomorrow. But please, take your time. I want to get to the bottom of this, if at all possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat here on the table. First, let's take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’m going to check your eyes. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can follow your finger, Doctor. Is everything alright? My vision feels a little… blurry at times, as I mentioned. But I can see you clearly enough, I believe. I do hope it’s nothing serious. It’s just… difficult to concentrate when I’m feeling unsteady, you know? It makes everything seem… a bit more chaotic.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Some mild blurring of the optic disc, which could be related to the reported visual changes. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Please stand up slowly. Okay, can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Oh dear… I… I don’t feel very steady. It’s… worse with my eyes closed. Please, be careful. I don’t want to fall. It's… rather alarming, really. I feel like I might topple over any moment.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. That’s okay. Don’t worry. Significant instability with eyes closed. Romberg sign is positive. Now, can you walk a straight line for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Oh dear… it’s… difficult. I have to focus very hard. I’m not usually this clumsy. It’s quite concerning, you know? I work on the rigs, and I need to be steady on my feet. This isn't very good, is it? I feel like I'm going to fall over any moment now.
DOCTOR: No, it's not ideal. Your gait is wide-based and unsteady. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric, which is normal. Now, can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I… I missed. It’s quite difficult to coordinate. My hand just… doesn’t seem to go where it’s supposed to. I haven't been very good at any of this, have I? I hope you’re not too worried, Doctor. This is quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright, Lilyanna. We're gathering information. Your finger-to-nose test is impaired. Okay, based on what I’ve seen, and considering your history, I suspect a possible vestibular issue – something affecting your inner ear balance system. However, it's too early to say definitively. We need to rule out other causes and get some further testing done. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. We should also consider an MRI of the brain to rule out any central nervous system problems. Do you have any concerns about an MRI?
PATIENT: An MRI… Oh dear. I’ve never had one before. Is it… painful? And what does it mean, exactly? I mean, you said "rule out"… does that mean you think something serious is wrong? I… I just want to know what’s happening. This is quite frightening, you know? I’m not used to being unwell, and I don't understand all of these terms. Vestibular… what was that? I apologize for being so… difficult. I just… I'm feeling rather overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Let's take this one step at a time. An MRI is a painless imaging test that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It's completely non-invasive. It's better to be cautious and rule out anything serious. "Vestibular" simply means the system in your inner ear that controls your balance. It's a common cause of unsteadiness, and it's often treatable. I'm not saying anything is seriously wrong, but as a doctor, it’s my job to investigate all possibilities. We’ll get these tests done, and then we’ll discuss the results and come up with a plan. I'm going to refer you to an ENT specialist—an ear, nose, and throat doctor—for further evaluation. They can perform more specialized balance tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An ENT specialist… Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as we're doing something. I just want to feel steady again. It's… unsettling to feel so disconnected. And the thought of falling… it's frightening. You think it could be something treatable, though? That’s… that’s very reassuring. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, just… keep me informed. And explain everything clearly. I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… a lot to take in. I haven’t felt this vulnerable in a long time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilyanna. We’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Many vestibular issues are treatable, with physical therapy or medication. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a very good ENT specialist in town. I'll also have the nurse print out some information about vestibular disorders for you to read. In the meantime, please be careful and avoid situations where you might fall. Use a cane or ask someone to walk with you if you need to. I'm also going to order a blood pressure check in the office in a week. We can re-evaluate and see if it has stabilized. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor Billman. The blood pressure check sounds sensible. And thank you for the referral to Dr. Ramirez. I appreciate your patience and your kindness. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. I suppose… I should go home and try to rest. And be careful. Yes. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. You're very welcome. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Ramirez. The nurse will give you the referral information and the information about vestibular disorders on your way out. Take care, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
