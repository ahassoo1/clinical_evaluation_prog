DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… a certification, I believe. Something about needing to be… current. Honestly, the paperwork these days is just dreadful. I was told I needed an eye exam, and a hearing check, I suppose. It's all rather… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right, a certification physical. I see. And are you experiencing any specific issues with your vision or hearing that prompted this, or is this purely for the certification requirements?
PATIENT: Issues? No, not precisely issues. One doesn’t generally have ‘issues’ with perfectly functional senses. It’s just… a formality. Though, I must admit, things haven’t been quite as sharp as they used to be. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? At my age. I certainly wouldn’t call it a problem. Just… a natural decline.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're proactive about getting it checked though, even if it's just a routine part of the certification. We'll do a quick eye exam and hearing test to get a baseline. Then we can discuss if any further investigation is needed. Let's start with your eyes. Have you worn glasses or contacts at any point in your life?
PATIENT: Glasses? Good heavens, no. Not I. I’ve always had perfectly adequate vision. My father had excellent eyesight, as did his father before him. Though… now that you mention it, reading small print has become a little… taxing. But that's the print’s fault, not mine, I assure you. They don’t make things like they used to. Much too small, everything is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's just do a quick visual acuity test to get a measurement. It'll just involve reading some letters on a chart. It's standard procedure. If you could please sit facing that chart over there, we'll get started. Do you have any trouble with your depth perception, or seeing colors normally?
PATIENT: Colors? Depth perception? Really, Doctor. I can see. I’ve spent my life… well, never mind. It’s rather insulting to be asked such questions. But very well, if you must know. I suppose everything looks… the way it should. Though I wouldn’t claim to be an expert in identifying subtle shades of… whatever it is you’re getting at. Lead on, then. But do try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Oriley. Just cover your left eye with your hand, and read the smallest line you can clearly see. Don't strain, just tell me what you see. We'll start with this top row... and then we’ll do the same with your right eye.
PATIENT: Honestly, these letters are terribly small. And the lighting is rather poor, don’t you think? Very well… let’s see. E… F… P… T… Oh, bother. Is that a V or a W? It’s… indistinct. This is quite ridiculous, really. V… maybe? Or is it a W? I can't be certain. This is utterly pointless.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It does seem like there's some difficulty with the smaller letters. We’ll repeat that with your right eye. It’s good we’re checking. Now, cover your right eye, and read the letters on this chart. Again, just tell me what you see, and don't strain.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I'm back in school. And not a particularly well-equipped school, at that. Very well… Let’s see… E… F… P… Oh, for goodness sake. It’s all a blur. Is that a… Q? Or perhaps a… O? I simply can't tell. It’s all rather upsetting, really. I’ve never had trouble seeing before. This must be the lighting. Absolutely dreadful lighting. Are we finished with this nonsense yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Oriley. Thank you for your patience. Based on this quick assessment, it seems you are experiencing some degree of visual impairment. It’s not uncommon at your age, but it’s important to investigate further. I’d like to perform a more comprehensive eye exam to determine the exact cause and best course of action. I’m going to schedule you with Dr. Anya Sharma, our ophthalmologist, for a full exam. She’s excellent. Would you be available sometime next week?
PATIENT: Visual impairment? Nonsense. I simply need a better light source, that’s all. And perhaps a larger font. Sending me to another doctor? Really, Doctor, is that absolutely necessary? I came here for a certification, not a… a specialist evaluation. Is this going to delay things? I have commitments, you know. Next week? Well… I suppose I could arrange something. But I expect it to be brief. And efficient. I have no desire to spend an entire afternoon being poked and prodded. Tell me exactly what this “ophthalmologist” intends to do. And how long it will take.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Oriley. It's not about suggesting a serious problem, but about being thorough. Dr. Sharma will perform a comprehensive exam, checking your vision, eye pressure, and the health of your eyes. It’s standard procedure when there’s a change in vision. It typically takes about 45 minutes to an hour. She can also advise on whether you might benefit from glasses, if necessary, and address any concerns you have about your vision. This will help ensure you meet the certification requirements and have the best possible vision. I’m scheduling you for Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Does that work?
PATIENT: An hour? Good heavens. Well, I suppose I have little choice. Tuesday… yes, that will have to do. But I expect prompt service. And I trust Dr. Sharma is… competent? I haven’t time for amateurs. And please ensure she understands I’m here solely for the certification. I have no interest in any unnecessary treatments or… suggestions. Just a quick assessment, and confirmation that I meet the requirements. Is that understood? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe we are finished with the eyes. Let’s proceed to this “hearing test” and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Oriley, I’ve made a detailed note of your preferences and concerns for Dr. Sharma. She is highly regarded and very efficient. Alright, let's move on to the hearing test. It’s a simple procedure; you’ll wear headphones and indicate when you hear tones at different frequencies. It will take about 15-20 minutes. If you’ll just step into that booth, and I’ll explain the process once you’re seated.
PATIENT: A booth? Really, Doctor. It looks rather… isolating. And what if I can’t hear the tones? Will I be trapped in there indefinitely? Very well. But I trust this won’t take long. And please, speak clearly. I find it increasingly difficult to decipher mumbling. Lead on, then. But do try to be swift about it. I haven’t all day, you know.
DOCTOR: It's a soundproof booth, Mr. Oriley, to eliminate background noise. You won't be trapped, I assure you. It's a quick test, and I'll be right here monitoring the results. You'll wear headphones, and I'll play tones at different frequencies. Simply press the button each time you hear a tone. I’ll explain it in more detail once you're inside. Let’s get started. I’ll be just outside if you need anything.
PATIENT: Very well. But if I experience any… discomfort, I expect immediate assistance. And please, ensure these headphones are clean. A button, you say? Alright. But do hurry. I find enclosed spaces… unsettling. Begin when you’re ready. But I warn you, my hearing isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I’m starting the test now. Just relax and press the button whenever you hear a tone. Don’t worry if you don’t hear some of them. It’s perfectly normal. I'll be monitoring the results and will let you know when we’re finished. Here we go…
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all… Is this thing even working? I haven’t heard a single sound. There. Just to be sure. This is a complete waste of time. Utterly pointless. Are you quite finished yet? I have matters to attend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, are you having any difficulty with the headphones?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Yes, I'm having difficulty! I haven't heard a single sound, as I've already informed you! It's a complete waste of time sitting here in this… this box, listening to nothing! Either the machine is broken, or my hearing is perfectly fine, and this entire exercise is a charade! Honestly, the incompetence is astounding. Get me out of here. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. It appears there may be an issue with the equipment. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let’s stop here. It seems we won't be able to complete the hearing test today. Given the difficulty with the hearing test, and your concerns about your vision, I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment with an audiologist to properly assess your hearing. That way, we can ensure you meet all the certification requirements. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Another appointment? Good heavens. This is becoming quite the ordeal. An audiologist now? Honestly, the bureaucracy is astounding. Very well. But I expect this to be the last appointment. I haven't time for endless tests and evaluations. Just get me a date, and let’s be done with it. And please, ensure this “audiologist” understands I’m here solely for the certification. No unnecessary treatments or suggestions. Just a quick assessment, and confirmation that I meet the requirements. Is that understood? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Oriley, I've made detailed notes of your preferences and concerns for the audiologist. They are highly regarded and very efficient. Alright. I’ve scheduled you for a hearing assessment with Dr. Lee next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. That should allow plenty of time for a thorough evaluation. So, to recap, you have an appointment with Dr. Sharma for a full eye exam next Tuesday at 2:00 PM, and with Dr. Lee for a hearing assessment next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Is that acceptable?
