DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Renzi, you say? Hmm. Well, it's this tiredness, you see. Just… utterly drained. It comes and goes, but when it comes, I can barely lift a teacup. And the young man at the lab said something about… my numbers being off? Creatinine, I think he called it. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to these things. My husband usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, and some concerns about lab results… alright. It is helpful when someone else handles those things, isn't it?
PATIENT: Helpful? It's essential. He's a very organized man, my Thomas. Always fussing over appointments and medications. I just… feel things, you know? I feel this weakness. It’s not like a normal tired, it’s… deeper. And it worries me, because I used to be strong. Back when I was diving, I could work all day without a peep.
DOCTOR: Diving, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, commercial diving! A proper job, it was. Not like these… desk jobs everyone has now. We built things, fixed things… underwater. It was hard work, of course, but a good hard work. Before my knees went, that is. And before… well, before things started to feel like this. It’s been a good many years now.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving… that is impressive work, Ardelle. It sounds like you've had a very active life. And when did you start noticing this tiredness creeping in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's hard to say exactly. Things just… faded. A little at a time. It’s been… a few years, I suppose. Maybe five? Ten? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I mostly notice it now when I try to do something around the house. Even just gardening is a struggle. I used to have the most beautiful roses… but now, I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s been a gradual onset, over perhaps five to ten years. And it’s impacting your daily activities now, like gardening. Do you notice anything else along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well… my muscles ache, sometimes. A sort of dull ache, all over. Not a sharp pain, just… heavy. And I've been falling a bit more. Just little stumbles, nothing serious, but enough to make Thomas worry. He keeps saying I need to be careful. He fusses so. Honestly, I think half of it is just old age.
DOCTOR: It's good that Thomas is looking out for you. And it is possible some of this is just part of getting older, but we should still look into these muscle aches and falls. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… now that you mention it, my feet do feel a bit puffy sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. I just thought it was the heat. It’s been awfully warm lately. I put my feet up, and it usually goes down. Not much swelling, really, just… a little thicker than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, some swelling in the feet, especially at the end of the day. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… Thomas keeps track of all that. I think I had my blood pressure checked a while back, and the doctor said it was a little high, but he gave me some pills. I take those, I think. And I had a bad knee for years, before I had it replaced. But other than that… I can’t really recall. Honestly, I don't like doctors much. They always poke and prod.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. We’ll take things slowly. You’re not expected to remember everything. You said you take pills for your blood pressure – do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Thomas handles the medications. Little white pills, I think. Or maybe they’re yellow? It's all a blur. He puts them in a little container, and I take them with my breakfast. I really don't pay attention to the details. I just swallow them and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll try to get a list of your medications from Thomas. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything Thomas puts in front of me, and he's a good cook. I might sneeze a bit in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I suppose. Nothing serious. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m a pretty sturdy woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your knees. Just a standard check-up. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly. Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. My knees are a bit sensitive, you know. And I don't like being cold.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll be quick and gentle. And I'll make sure you're covered up so you don't get cold. Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. And finally, let’s take a look at your knees… Some crepitus noted with range of motion, consistent with previous replacement. Mild tenderness to palpation medially.
PATIENT: Ouch! Careful there, Doctor. Yes, they do ache a bit, especially when it’s damp. The replacement did help, of course, but they’re never quite the same, are they? They click and pop all the time. Thomas says I sound like a bowl of Rice Krispies when I walk.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the discomfort, Ardelle. And yes, you're right, joint replacements are rarely quite the same as the original. “Rice Krispies” is a very apt description! Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few things further. The tiredness, muscle aches, swelling, and the creatinine level from the lab… it could be a few different things, but one possibility is kidney issues. Even mild kidney problems can cause these symptoms.
PATIENT: Kidney issues? Oh dear. That sounds serious. Thomas’ mother had kidney problems, I remember that. Is that what you think it is? Will I need… one of those machines? I don’t like machines.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Ardelle. It could be kidney issues, but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities. And no, you won’t necessarily need a machine. We'll start with some blood tests to get a clearer picture of your kidney function and other important levels. We'll also repeat that creatinine test. This will help us understand what's going on. We'll also check your vitamin D levels as low vitamin D can also cause fatigue and muscle aches. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more poking and prodding, I suppose. Well, if it will help figure things out… alright. But no machines, Doctor. Promise me, no machines. Thomas will be furious if I end up hooked up to a machine. He worries so much.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ardelle. No machines at this stage. Just some routine blood work. I'll also write you a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – just to have them review the results with us, if needed. It's best to have all the information, and they’re the experts in this area. I'll also write a work note, excusing you from strenuous activity until we have the results back. And, I’ll have the nurse get you a list of pharmacies in the area. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: A specialist… oh dear. More doctors. But… alright. If you think it’s best. And a work note… that’s good. Thomas will be pleased. I mostly just potter around the garden these days anyway. And a list of pharmacies… yes, that would be helpful. Honestly, I don’t know where anything is in this town anymore. Everything changes so quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. I'll get the nurse to come in and draw your blood, and we’ll get those tests ordered. The results usually take a few days. I'll have the nurse give you a copy of the lab requisition form and contact information for the nephrologist. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – like increased swelling, shortness of breath, or significant fatigue – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For not making me feel like a silly old woman. Thomas will be relieved to hear we have a plan. He always says I worry too much, but it’s hard not to when you feel like this. Tell your nurse to be gentle with the needle, though, will you? My veins aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. I’ll let the nurse know to be extra gentle. And you're not silly at all, and your concerns are perfectly valid. We’ll take good care of you. Now, let me call the nurse in to get started. Please relax, and we'll get everything taken care of.
