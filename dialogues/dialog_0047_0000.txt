DOCTOR: Right. Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's this… weakness in my legs. It just came on suddenly, after I had a bad cold. It's quite inconvenient, really. I’m a tour guide, you see, and you can’t very well guide a tour when you can barely stand.
DOCTOR: A sudden onset of weakness… after a cold. Right. And how long ago did this cold resolve, and when did you first notice the weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. The cold… it was probably a week ago it really cleared up. Maybe a little sniffle for a couple of days after, but nothing major. And the legs… hmm. I’d say about three days ago, maybe? It started subtly, like I was a little more tired than usual after a long walk. Now… well, now it’s just there. It’s hard to explain. It's not pain, it's just… heavy. And unreliable. I don't trust them, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Unreliable… heavy. I understand. And is this weakness in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, both. Definitely both. It’s not like one is perfectly fine and the other isn’t. It's… symmetrical, I suppose. Though, if I had to pick, the left one feels a little worse. Not dramatically, but… noticeable. It’s rather unsettling, honestly. I’ve never experienced anything like it.
DOCTOR: Symmetrical weakness, slightly worse on the left… Alright. And are you experiencing any numbness, tingling, or changes in sensation in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No tingling, no numbness. It doesn’t feel different, exactly. Just… weaker. Like I’m wading through something. It's hard to describe. I can feel everything, just… less able to do anything with them. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, wading through something… I understand. Now, aside from the legs, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No fever, no chills. No headaches or dizziness. My appetite’s been normal, thankfully. I've been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't these days? And… no, that’s about it. Nothing else jumps out. I do get a little winded easily, but I’m not a young woman anymore, am I?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago – that was in… 2008, I think? And high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. Nothing else serious. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk a lot for work, and I eat reasonably well. I don't smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. It’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, probably five years now. It seems to do the trick, the doctor always says my numbers are good.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams… good. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’m pretty lucky that way. No known allergies to anything, really. Food, medications, anything. Though I prefer to avoid anything with artificial sweeteners, if I can help it. They give me a headache. But that's a preference, not an allergy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No known allergies… Alright. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... well, my mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father… he had heart trouble. High cholesterol, I think. That's about it, really. Nobody else in my immediate family had any serious health issues, to my knowledge. Everyone was pretty sturdy, Honduran people are generally quite resilient, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Could you please stand up for me and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. Here we go. Don't mind if I'm a bit slow, Doctor. It's a little… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Alright. And if you don’t mind, could you try to walk on your heels for a few steps, and then on your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is… awkward. This is not easy, Doctor. It feels very precarious. And… Oh dear. I might need to sit down, I'm afraid. This is… alarming.
DOCTOR: Easy now. Yes, please sit down. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I'm going to tap your knees with this little hammer, it won't hurt.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Reflexes, yes. Do tell me if it's unpleasant. I don’t like surprises, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. There you go. Is that alright? Do you need me to squeeze harder? I can try.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… a little weak, but not dramatically so. Given your symptoms, the exam findings, and your recent cold, it is difficult to say with certainty what is going on. It could be a post-viral weakness, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and vitamin B12 level. And I'm going to order an MRI of your spine to rule out any nerve compression. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI… and blood work. That sounds… serious, doesn't it? I was hoping it was just a lingering effect of the cold. Nerve compression… that sounds frightening. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Let’s do whatever we need to do to figure out what's going on. I just… I don’t want to be unable to work. That’s my livelihood, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is better to be thorough. The blood work and MRI will help us determine the cause of your weakness and the best course of treatment. I'm going to give you a referral to a neurologist. They are the specialists in these kinds of problems. I will also give you a prescription for a walking aid – a cane – to help you stay safe and prevent falls while you're waiting for your results. I'd like to see you back here in one week to discuss the results of the tests. In the meantime, if your weakness worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or bowel or bladder problems, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A neurologist… and a cane. This is all rather… overwhelming. Bowel or bladder problems? That sounds… alarming. I haven't experienced anything like that. Yes, I do have a question. What if it is something serious? What are we talking about, realistically? I don't like to be left in the dark, Doctor. I prefer to know what I'm facing, even if it's not good news.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Firestone, it’s too early to say definitively what's going on. The possibilities range from a relatively benign post-viral weakness, which often resolves on its own with time, to something more serious, such as a nerve compression in your spine, or, rarely, a neurological condition affecting the nerves or muscles. The MRI will help us to rule out the more serious possibilities. The bowel and bladder symptoms I mentioned are important because they can indicate a problem with the spinal cord, which would require immediate attention. I don’t want to frighten you, but I want you to be aware of all the possibilities. I assure you, we will work together to get to the bottom of this and develop a treatment plan that's right for you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. It’s… not what I wanted to hear, but I appreciate your honesty. A nerve compression… would that require surgery? And what if it is a neurological condition? What kind of treatment is available for those? I suppose I should prepare myself for the worst, shouldn’t I? It's just… I’ve always been so independent. The thought of needing help with everything… it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking these questions, Ms. Firestone. Regarding nerve compression, sometimes physical therapy and medication can be enough to manage the symptoms. However, in some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure on the nerve. As for neurological conditions, the treatment options vary widely depending on the specific condition. Some conditions can be managed with medication, while others may require physical therapy, occupational therapy, or other interventions. There are also many support groups and resources available to help people cope with neurological conditions. I will provide you with information on these resources when we discuss your test results. It's important to remember that we don't know what's going on yet, and it's possible that you won't need any of these treatments. But it's good to be prepared, and I want you to know that you're not alone in this. I will write you a referral to Dr. Alvarez, a highly respected neurologist in the area, and also a prescription for a cane to help with your stability. Do you have any other questions before we finish for today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I suppose… I suppose I should just focus on getting through the week, and try not to worry too much. It’s easier said than done, but… thank you, Doctor. For being honest with me, and for… explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I’ll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Firestone. And you're right to focus on getting through the week. Try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
