DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it's about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up before I let anyone near my face with a scalpel. She worries too much, honestly. I just want to get this over with so I can get back to things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your daughter is looking out for you, even if it feels a bit much at times. And it’s always wise to be thorough before any procedure. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit more about this procedure you’re referring to?
PATIENT: It’s a… face lift. That’s what the young man at the clinic called it. Said my skin was “lax.” Lax! I’ve lived a good life, spent plenty of time outdoors. A little weathering is to be expected. It’s not like I’m asking for a full reconstruction, just a tightening here and there. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. They should just get on with it.
DOCTOR: I see. A face lift, or rhytidectomy. Right. Well, even a seemingly minor procedure benefits from a check-up to ensure you’re in the best possible health for recovery. It's good you're having it done at a proper clinic. Now, let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. The doctor put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn't feel right. Felt sluggish. Besides, it was just a little high. My wife used to measure it, but… well, she’s gone now. Never had anything else, not really. I eat reasonably, sleep alright, and I’ve never been one for smoking or drinking much. Strong constitution, you see. Norwegian blood.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for people to discontinue medications due to side effects. And it's good to hear you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's helpful to know you've had high blood pressure in the past, even if it wasn't consistently treated. Do you happen to recall the name of that medication, or approximately when you were taking it?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was ages ago. Some little white pill. They all look the same, don’t they? Probably back in the… nineties, maybe? I wasn't keeping track of things then like I do now. My wife handled all the pills and appointments. I just took what she gave me. It’s not as if it mattered much. I felt fine, and that's all that concerned me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can work with that. Sometimes memory of specific medications fades over time. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago, of course. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while I was fixing the roof. Nothing serious. Just a cast for a few weeks. Other than that… no. Nothing that required a hospital stay. I’m a practical man, I avoid trouble when I can.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: My mother lived to be ninety-two, so good genes on her side, I suppose. She died of… old age, mostly. My father had something with his heart, I think. A weak heart, they said. He wasn’t a strong man, always indoors, unlike me. And my sister… she had cancer, lung cancer. Smoked like a chimney, she did. Terrible habit. But other than that, no. Not really. A lot of just… normal ailments.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to have a picture of your family history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little fish oil. For my joints. Getting old, you know. A little creaky. And sometimes I take an aspirin if I have a bad headache. But that's it. Nothing regular. I prefer to let my body handle things on its own. All these pills… they just mask the real problem, don't they?
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never had allergies. Not to penicillin, not to bee stings, nothing. I’ve always been quite robust, you see. My wife was the one with the sensitivities. Pollen, dust, certain foods… always something. But me? Never.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to quickly review your current symptoms. Aside from the desire for a face lift, are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other changes in your health?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… sagging skin. That’s all. A little disappointed with how things are looking, that’s all. My daughter says I look tired. Honestly, I feel fine. Strong as an ox, I tell you. But if this procedure can give me a little… boost, a little more confidence, then fine. But I don't need it, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like this is more about a cosmetic desire than a medical necessity. That’s perfectly valid. Now, to ensure you’re a suitable candidate for the procedure and to establish a baseline for your health record, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, rate is around 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Blood pressure is 138/82. Skin is appropriate for age, some expected sun damage noted. No acute rashes or lesions. Pulses are strong and regular. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Overall, your general physical exam is within normal limits for your age. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. It might be beneficial to monitor it more closely.
PATIENT: Elevated? Hmph. Probably just from the stress of all this fuss. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. What does that even mean, "monitor it more closely?" Do I need to come back here every week?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean weekly visits, Mr. Orwin. “Monitoring more closely” could involve checking your blood pressure at home with a simple device a few times a week, and keeping a log to share with me at your next appointment. Or, if you prefer, we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to re-check it. It's just a precaution, given your past history of high blood pressure. Now, regarding the face lift itself, do you have any questions about the procedure or the recovery process?
PATIENT: Recovery process… will it be painful? And how long will I have to stay cooped up inside? I have things to do, you know. I’m not one for sitting around. And will it… look natural? I don’t want to end up looking like one of those… overly-done actresses.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Orwin. Pain levels typically range from mild to moderate and can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers or, if needed, a short course of prescription medication. We'll discuss pain management strategies in detail before the procedure. As for downtime, most patients need about two weeks for significant swelling and bruising to subside. You'll likely have some limitations on activity during that period, but light activities are usually permissible after the first week. And regarding the aesthetic result, achieving a natural look is our priority. The surgeon will tailor the procedure to your individual anatomy and discuss your desired outcome thoroughly. It's important to have realistic expectations, and we can certainly show you before-and-after photos of previous patients to give you a better idea of what to expect. Do you have a specific surgeon in mind for the procedure, or would you like me to provide a referral to a qualified plastic surgeon in the area?
PATIENT: No, no specific surgeon. I just went to that clinic because they were advertising. As long as they can get it done quickly and make me look… decent again, I suppose. Decent. That’s all I ask for. Not a miracle, just decent.
DOCTOR: Alright. In that case, I can provide you with a list of board-certified plastic surgeons in the area with good reputations. I recommend scheduling consultations with a few different surgeons to discuss your goals and get their professional opinions. Before I finalize the referral, do you have any other medical concerns that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Honestly, you’ve kept me here long enough. Just send me the list, and let me get on with it. I've got a garden to tend, you know. Can’t let the weeds take over.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. Here’s a list of three plastic surgeons, along with their contact information and websites. I’ll also include a handout with post-operative instructions and warning signs to look out for. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before or after your consultation. And remember to follow the surgeon’s instructions carefully. I wish you all the best with the procedure. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Thank you. Or… well, I suppose we'll see if it's worth thanking you later.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Orwin. Have a pleasant day, and I hope to hear good things. .
