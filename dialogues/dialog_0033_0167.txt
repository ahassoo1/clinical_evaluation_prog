DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Stoegbauer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Emiliano Stoegbauer. Good day to you, Doctor… Dechêne, yes? I am glad to finally be here.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. Please, just Dechêne is fine. And you’re glad to be here?
PATIENT: Well, yes. My foot… it has been causing me much trouble. I don't like being in pain, and my grandson, he told me I should come see someone. He worries about me, you see. He is a good boy.
DOCTOR: Right. The foot. And how long has this "trouble" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That is a good question. A little while now, I think. Maybe… two, three months? It started small, just a little sore spot. I didn’t think much of it at first. Old age, you know? But it has gotten bigger… and now it hurts to walk. I try to wear slippers all the time.
DOCTOR: "A little sore spot" that’s now causing pain with walking. Okay. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it is not a sharp pain, Doctor. It is more of a… a dull ache. And sometimes, especially when I try to stand after sitting for a while, it feels… hot. And a little bit tender to the touch. I try not to bother it too much, but it is hard when everything hurts when I walk. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s have a look. Could you please point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Certainly. Right here, Doctor. It’s mostly on this foot, and right around here feels the worst. It’s hard to say exactly, but it is mostly in this area. And sometimes, up here a little bit.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness along the plantar fascia… and some mild swelling, I suppose. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Oh… that is a little uncomfortable. It feels… stretched, maybe? I don't know if that makes sense. It is not a bad pain, but I can feel it. I am a little unsteady, please excuse me.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. A little unsteady… and discomfort with weight-bearing. Do you have any tingling or numbness in your foot?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. And no numbness either. It just… hurts. Like a constant ache, you know? It’s worse in the morning, I think. When I first get out of bed, it feels very stiff. Then it loosens up a little bit as I get moving, but it never really goes away completely. Does that make sense, Doctor? I'm trying to be as helpful as I can.
DOCTOR: Right. Morning stiffness… typical. Any history of diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My doctor told me a long time ago, maybe… twenty years ago? Something like that. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I sneak a little bit of my grandson's cookies. He brings me nice cookies. I take some pills for it, every morning. I don’t always remember exactly what they are for, but I know they are important.
DOCTOR: Okay. Diabetes… and medication. We'll need to get a better handle on that medication list. Have you had any recent blood sugar checks?
PATIENT: No, not recently. Not since my last checkup with Dr. Akana. That was… last year, I believe. He checks everything then. I haven't been back since. To be honest, it is sometimes hard to get around, and the waiting room is always so busy. And I don't like bothering people.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s review your allergies, if you don’t mind. Any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with anything. I eat everything, pretty much. I like poke, and kalua pig, and all sorts of good Hawaiian food. No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you likely have plantar fasciitis, complicated by your history of diabetes. We need to control your blood sugar, first and foremost. And we'll need to get you started on some treatment for the foot itself. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Plant… plantar… fasciitis? I'm not sure I understand, Doctor. Is that… bad? And what does controlling my blood sugar have to do with my foot? I’m sorry, I’m just an old man. It is hard to keep up with all these things.
DOCTOR: It means inflammation of the tissue on the bottom of your foot. And diabetes can damage your nerves and blood vessels, making it harder to heal and increasing your risk of complications. It's very important to manage it. We’ll start with some stretching exercises, and I’ll prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication. But you must get your blood sugar under control. I'm referring you to Dr. Akana for a follow-up appointment within two weeks to discuss that further. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Oh… so it is my sugar that is making my foot hurt? That makes a little bit of sense, I suppose. Stretching exercises… I can try that. And pills… I am already taking pills. So, I see Dr. Akana… and I stretch… and take pills… Is that right? And how will I get the… stretching exercises? Will you show me? I don't want to do it wrong. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining. It is a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. This pamphlet has instructions for the stretching exercises. And you need to schedule an appointment with Dr. Akana immediately. I’ll have my nurse give you a referral slip. We’ll review your medication list at your next appointment here, once you've seen Dr. Akana. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Yes, one question. Will this… this plantar… whatever it is, will it stop me from walking? I like to walk down to the beach sometimes, and I don't want to lose that. It is my favorite thing to do. And I want to be able to play with my grandson when he comes to visit. He likes to build sandcastles. I just want to be able to enjoy things.
DOCTOR: If you follow the treatment plan and manage your blood sugar, it shouldn’t. But you need to be diligent. Now, my nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks to assess your progress. And she will give you the referral slip for Dr. Akana. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you very much, Doctor Dechêne. You have been very helpful, even if it is a little bit confusing. I will try my best to remember everything. And I will see Dr. Akana as soon as I can. I appreciate your time. Aloha.
