DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Yes, well, “pleasure” might be a strong word. Look, I don’t have all day, Doctor. I’m Angelle Shteynberg. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure it happens. I’m… not getting any younger, you see. I want to avoid any… difficulties. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Ms. Shteynberg. You're interested in preconception counseling and evaluation to optimize your chances of a successful pregnancy. I understand your concern about timing, and we will certainly do our best to be efficient. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: My… menstrual cycle? Really? You need to know that? Look, I'm 51. It’s… irregular. What does that even matter? I’m healthy, I exercise, I eat reasonably well. I don't need a lecture on… womanly things. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I apologize if my question seemed intrusive. It’s not a lecture, simply a crucial piece of information. At your age, the predictability of ovulation – and therefore the timing of conception – can be less reliable. Understanding your cycle helps us determine the best course of action. To clarify, when was the last time you had a menstrual period?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. Let me think… It was… July 12th, I believe. Yes, July 12th. But honestly, Doctor, I barely keep track. It comes and goes. It’s not like it’s a perfectly timed event. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just going to ask me about… monthly things all day?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. July 12th is helpful. And I assure you, we are getting somewhere. Irregular cycles at your age require a slightly more comprehensive approach. To get a clearer picture, could you describe any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Hot flashes? Mood swings? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a woman of a certain age. I experience… life. I'm not sure what you're expecting me to say. Do you want a full medical history? Because frankly, I'm not particularly thrilled with this line of questioning. I came here to make a baby, not to rehash every ache and pain of the last five decades.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, you are absolutely right to express your concerns. I apologize if my questions feel invasive or unproductive. My intention is not to rehash your entire medical history, but to identify anything that might impact your ability to conceive or carry a pregnancy. Let’s focus specifically on the last six months. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, sleep patterns, or appetite?
PATIENT: Six months? Honestly, Doctor, my life hasn’t drastically changed in the last six months. I work, I exercise, I try to eat healthily. My energy levels are… normal for a woman my age. I sleep when I can, and I eat when I’m hungry. Is this really necessary? I’m starting to suspect I’ve made a terrible mistake coming here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration. I assure you, this line of questioning is important. Even seemingly minor changes can provide valuable information. To rule out any underlying factors, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss or gain? Look, I may have put on a pound or two over the holidays, but nothing significant! I’m not obese, if that’s what you’re hinting at. I maintain a reasonable weight for my height, which, by the way, is 186 centimeters, and I weigh 86 kilograms. Are we cataloging my entire physique now? This is ridiculous. I need answers, not a body scan.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That information is helpful. I apologize if it feels like I'm focusing on details that seem unimportant. It’s my practice to be thorough, especially given your age and desire to conceive. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, now we get to the important stuff. Look, I have… had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure in the past, but it’s managed with medication. Nothing serious. And no, I don’t have diabetes. And my thyroid is perfectly fine, thank you very much. I had it checked last year. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a generally healthy woman. I’m not some frail invalid. This is getting… tiresome. Can we just move on to what can be done, instead of dissecting every aspect of my being?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That's good to know. And I apologize again for the seemingly exhaustive questioning. It’s important to understand the full picture. To clarify, what medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, do you always need to know everything? It’s… Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, daily. Happy now? I swear, you’re like a detective interrogating a suspect. I came here hoping for some help, not a third degree.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. Lisinopril is helpful information. And I assure you, my intention is not to interrogate you. It’s vital to understand all medications you’re taking, as some can impact fertility or pregnancy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed, oh, about fifteen years ago. And I broke my arm once when I was a child, but that’s hardly relevant. And… no, nothing else significant. I'm not a frequent visitor to hospitals, thank you very much. Honestly, Doctor, are you writing a novel?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. The gallbladder removal is helpful information. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, for… Look, my mother had high blood pressure, and my grandmother… well, she lived to be 95, so I suppose that’s good. No history of… genetic diseases or anything dramatic. Honestly, we’re not a particularly sickly family. I’m starting to regret this whole appointment.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That's good to know. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, now you ask the interesting questions. Look, I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. A glass, Doctor, not a bottle. I do not smoke, and I certainly do not use recreational drugs. I am a civilized woman. Honestly, this line of questioning is insulting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. I appreciate your honesty. Now, with that information gathered, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Now? After all this… interrogation? Look, I suppose. But please, be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. And I’d prefer not to be… prodded and poked unnecessarily. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I will listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t detect any tenderness. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your age and desire to conceive, I recommend a few blood tests to assess your hormone levels and ovarian reserve. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. But… fine. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please, tell me what these tests involve. And how long they’ll take. I don’t want to spend my entire life in this clinic. And I expect results quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. The blood tests will involve a standard blood draw from your arm. We'll be checking your Follicle-Stimulating Hormone , Luteinizing Hormone , Estradiol, Anti-Mullerian Hormone , and a complete blood count. These tests will give us a better understanding of your ovarian function and overall health. The tests typically take 10-15 minutes to draw, and the results usually come back within 5-7 business days. While we’re waiting for the results, we can discuss potential options and address any concerns you may have. Would you like me to order those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Fine. Order the tests. Anything to get this over with. And please, make sure they get done quickly. I don't have all day, you know. And… is there anything else you need to ask me? Because frankly, I’m about ready to leave.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have ordered the blood tests for you. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw the samples. At this point, while we await the results, there are no further questions I have for you. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately one week from today to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: One week. Fine. As long as it’s not a full day commitment. Honestly, I’m starting to feel… drained. Alright, one week. Get me out of here now. And please, don’t expect me to be overjoyed with small talk. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand. I will have my receptionist schedule that for you now. Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day. .
