DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, to be honest, I'm here about... PrEP. I heard about it and wanted to ask some questions, see if it might be right for me. I’m not getting any younger, and better safe than sorry, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very smart thing to be thinking about, Helaina. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a great option for HIV prevention. Absolutely, better safe than sorry. Before we get into the specifics, can you tell me a little bit about your health history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm 55, as you can see on the chart. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing major. No big surgeries, no chronic illnesses. Just… getting older. I have Medicare, that’s about it. Oh, and I work as a parking attendant downtown, so I’m on my feet a lot. Single, never been married. Does that help? I can go into more detail if you need me to. I remember dates really well, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Knowing you've been generally healthy is a good starting point. And being a parking attendant, being on your feet all day, that's useful information too. You mentioned never being married…just to clarify, have you ever had any sexual partners?
PATIENT: Um… yes. A few, over the years. Nothing serious, really. Mostly…dates. A couple of longer things, but nothing that lasted. It's been…a while since I've been with anyone regularly, though. Why do you ask? Is that…is it important for PrEP? I don’t mind answering, it's just…a little personal, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand it's personal, and thank you for being open with me. It is important for PrEP. PrEP is most effective for people at risk of HIV exposure through sexual contact. It helps to understand your recent sexual history and practices to determine if PrEP is right for you and to discuss the best way to take it, if it is. Specifically, have you had any sexual contact in the past six months?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I met someone…about four months ago. It's been…casual. Not a lot, but a few times. It’s… complicated. I didn’t really think about…protection, honestly. I just…met him. He seemed nice. That’s why I’m here, I guess. To be safe. I should have thought of this sooner. Is he going to find out I'm asking about this? I don't want him to be upset.
DOCTOR: It's very responsible of you to think about this now, Helaina. It's never too late to prioritize your health. And no, he absolutely won't find out. This is all confidential medical information. Your privacy is very important. To help me assess your risk and determine if PrEP is appropriate, can you tell me anything about this partner?
PATIENT: Um… well, I don't know him that well. We met online. He’s…older, maybe a little younger than me, I think. He said he was…separated. He seemed healthy enough. We haven’t…talked about his past. Or anything really personal. Just…casual dates. I don't know if he's been tested for anything. That's probably a stupid thing to admit, isn't it? I just…I didn't think to ask. I feel really foolish now. Is this going to make a difference? Should I call him and ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish at all, Helaina. It's common not to have those conversations early on, and it's understandable. It's good you're thinking about it now. Knowing as much as possible is always best, but we can proceed even without that information. We can discuss getting you tested, which is a good first step regardless. Before we talk about testing, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had to take much. A little penicillin when I was a kid, but nothing serious. No reactions, as far as I remember. I can’t recall ever having an allergic reaction to anything, honestly. Does that include over-the-counter stuff? I take ibuprofen sometimes for aches, from being on my feet all day. But nothing else regularly. I'm pretty careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. And ibuprofen is fine. One last question before we move on to physical exam and testing: are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think that’s everything. Oh! Wait. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. Just when I remember. And……this. It’s St. John’s Wort. My neighbor said it helps with my mood. I’ve been taking it on and off for a few months. Is that…bad? I didn't even think about mentioning it. It's not a real medication, is it?
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Helaina. That is important. St. John's Wort can interact with many medications, including those used for HIV treatment and PrEP. It can make those medications less effective. It's good you mentioned it, and we'll need to discuss stopping it if we decide PrEP is right for you. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That’s…fine. I guess I should have asked more questions before coming in. Everything just happened so fast. I just…wanted to be safe. But yes, go ahead. Do whatever you need to do. I just hope this isn’t too complicated. .
