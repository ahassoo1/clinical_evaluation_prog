DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. So, to start us off, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer’s the name, Betty Schneer. Well now… it’s somethin’ with me ears, I reckon. They just ain't what they used to be. People mumble, ya know? Or maybe I mumble. It’s hard to say these days. I just know I don’t catch everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common for hearing to change as we get older, Mr. Schneer. And it can be hard to tell if it’s you or them sometimes! Could you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start… that’s a tricky one. Seems like a while now. Maybe… a year or so ago? It kinda crept up on me, nothin’ sudden. I used to be able to hear the birds clear as a bell, even with the windows closed. Now… not so much. Used to be able to hear the television just fine, too. Now I gotta turn it up a bit. My neighbors probably hate me.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Schneer. So, it’s been gradually worsening over about a year. And you've noticed it affecting your ability to hear both birdsong and the television. Is it worse in certain situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… certain situations… let me think. Yes, I believe it is. When there's a lot of noise, it’s awful. Like when I go to the diner for lunch. All the clatter and chatter… it just blends together. I can hear people talkin’, but I can’t make out what they’re sayin’. And… churches are bad too. Too much echo. Quiet places are better, of course. But even then, it's not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s definitely worse in noisy environments, and echoes don't help. That gives us a good clue. And when you are in a quiet place, would you say sounds just seem quieter overall, or is it more that you struggle to understand the words?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question… Let me see… I think it’s more the understandin’ part. Sounds ain’t necessarily quiet, just… muffled, maybe? Like someone’s talkin’ with a mouthful of cotton. I can hear something, but the words… they just get lost. It's especially bad with women's voices. They seem higher pitched and harder to make out. Men are a bit easier, for some reason. Don’t ask me why!
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Schneer. The difference with men’s and women’s voices is interesting – that can sometimes point to specific types of hearing loss. Now, have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you mention it, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It comes and goes. Sorta high-pitched, like… like a tea kettle whistlin’ softly. Mostly when it's very quiet. Like when I’m tryin’ to fall asleep. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it’s there. I just try to ignore it. Never really thought much of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent ringing in your ears, more noticeable when it’s quiet. That's important information. Now, thinking about your past, have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises, either at work or during hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, now that I think about it, yes. Back when I was younger, I worked in a shoe factory. Lots of machines bangin’ and whirrin’ all day long. It was noisy, alright. Didn’t think much of it at the time. Everyone wore earplugs sometimes, but… I wasn’t always good about wearin’ ‘em. Especially when it was hot, they just felt so uncomfortable. And I used to go to dances a lot, too. The music was pretty loud at those.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exposure to loud noises at the shoe factory and at dances. That’s a potential factor. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever had any ear infections or ear surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, alright. Ear infections… let me see. I think I had one or two as a little girl, but nothin’ serious. A doctor gave me some drops, and they cleared up quick enough. As for surgeries… no, I don’t think I’ve ever had any surgery on my ears. I’ve had my tonsils out when I was young, but that was it. Everything else, I reckon, has been above the neck.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you ever had any head injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Head injuries… hmm. Now that you mention it, I bumped my head once, years ago. Tripped over a rug at my neighbor’s house. Didn’t knock me out or anything, just a bit of a bruise. And… oh! I hit my head on a low-hangin’ branch while pickin’ apples. Again, nothin’ serious. Mostly just a bump and a bit of a headache. I’ve always been a bit clumsy, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, just to finish up with your history, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so I’m takin’ pills for that. And… I think I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad. Mostly just stiff in the mornin'. Other than that… no, I reckon I’m pretty healthy for an old bird.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. That gives me a good picture of your history. Now, I'm going to do a quick examination of your ears to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, alright. Go right ahead, Doctor. I don’t mind a bit. I’m used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’. Just be gentle, alright? These old ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. I’m just going to take a look inside your ears with this instrument. It doesn't hurt. First, I’ll check the outer ear, then I’ll gently insert the instrument into your ear canal. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright, looking at your left ear now… I see some wax buildup, but nothing major. The ear canal itself looks normal. And now your right ear… similar findings – some wax buildup, but nothing too significant. The eardrum looks a little dull, but I can't get a very clear view with the wax present. Both of your eardrums appear intact, which is good. However, the wax is obstructing my view. I’d like to gently remove the wax to get a better look and perform a hearing test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible to me. If you can’t see properly, how can you know what’s goin’ on? Go ahead and get rid of the wax, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, like you said. Don’t want to poke a hole in anything!
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very careful. I’ll use a small instrument and gentle irrigation with warm water. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, now I’m gently loosening the wax… and irrigating with warm water… Alright, that’s the wax from your left ear now. And now, removing the wax from your right ear… There we go. Okay, much better view now. Your eardrums are a little bit retracted, meaning they’re pulled in slightly, but there’s no sign of inflammation or fluid. However, they do appear a little bit… thickened. This, combined with your history of gradual hearing loss, noise exposure, and intermittent ringing, points towards a likely diagnosis of… age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis. It's very common, especially with your history. We can confirm this with a formal hearing test. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: Presby… what-now-sis? Oh dear. Sounds complicated. Age-related, you say? Well, I am gettin’ on a bit. That figures, I suppose. I’ve always been told I was a bit slow in pickin’ things up. A hearin’ test, you say? Well, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then let’s do it. I just want to know what’s goin’ on and if there’s somethin’ I can do about it. I don’t want to be shoutin’ at folks all the time!
DOCTOR: It’s not complicated, Mr. Schneer. It just means your hearing has naturally declined with age. It’s very common, and there are things we can do about it. The hearing test will help us determine the extent of the hearing loss and what type of hearing aids, if any, would be beneficial. We can also discuss strategies to help you manage your hearing loss in the meantime. I'll have my assistant schedule you for a hearing test with our audiologist, Sarah Miller. She's excellent. It usually takes about an hour. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible and using closed captioning when watching television. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Closed captionin’, that’s a good idea. My grandson showed me how to do that on the television a while back, but I forgot all about it. Um… let me see. If I need hearin’ aids… are they those big things folks used to wear? And… are they expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Schneer. The hearing aids of today are very different than the ones of the past. They’re much smaller, more discreet, and more technologically advanced. Many of them fit completely inside the ear canal. And yes, they can be expensive. However, most insurance plans, including Medicare, will cover a portion of the cost. We have a financial counselor who can help you explore your options and determine what your out-of-pocket expenses would be. We work with several different manufacturers and have models to fit a variety of budgets. We’ll discuss all of this in more detail if the hearing test confirms a significant hearing loss. For now, let’s just focus on getting the test scheduled. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds sensible. I don't want to worry about prices and fancy gadgets just yet. Let’s see what the test says first. If I need ‘em, I need ‘em, I suppose. Yes, go ahead and schedule the test. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with this old bird.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. My assistant, Lisa, will come in shortly to schedule the hearing test for you. She’ll also provide you with some written information about hearing loss and our clinic’s services. Before Lisa gets here, do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s all for now, Doctor. Just gettin’ a bit worried about not hearin’ properly. But you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. Remember, hearing loss is very common, and there are many things we can do to help. Lisa will be in shortly. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns.
