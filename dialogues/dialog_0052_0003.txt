DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. It’s this…hand. Shakes. Been shaking for a while now. It’s just…annoying, mostly. Don’t remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Old age, probably. What do you want to know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. “Annoying” is a perfectly valid way to describe it. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say “for a while now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Honestly, lady, I’m eighty years old. Things blur together. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s hard to say. It started slowly, you know? Just a little quiver. Now it's… more noticeable. Look, I used to have steady hands. Directed a lot of films, needed 'em to be steady. Not like this.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Baide. It’s perfectly normal for recall to be less precise over time, and it’s very helpful to know it developed gradually over the past six to twelve months, and that you previously had steady hands due to your film work. That’s good information. Could you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It shakes! What do you want me to do, act it out? It's mostly in my right hand, though sometimes the left one feels a bit wobbly too. It's worse when I try to do something precise, like…holding a fork, or signing my name. It’s not constant, mind you. It comes and goes. And it’s… irritating, that’s what it is. Really irritating.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Baide. I didn’t mean to ask you to “act it out.” I simply want to understand the nature of the shaking as precisely as possible. It’s helpful to know it’s primarily in your right hand, sometimes affects the left, and is exacerbated by tasks requiring fine motor skills. You mentioned it’s not constant. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, or make it worse, besides precise movements?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Look, I don't go around looking for triggers. It just happens. Though… now that you mention it, it seems worse when I'm stressed. Thinking about money, mostly. Always a worry. And sometimes… when I haven’t had enough coffee. Don't tell anyone, but I like a strong cup, or two, in the morning. It helps me focus. But maybe it makes the shaking worse, I don't know. Honestly, I just wish it would stop.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. That's very helpful information. Stress related to financial concerns and possible correlation with caffeine intake are important details. We'll explore those further. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I'm eighty years old! What doesn't ache? I get tired easily, that’s for sure. And my memory… well, you've already established that's not the best. But anything besides that? Hmm… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet, but I figured that was just old age too. And I’ve been a bit constipated lately, if you really want to know. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. It’s important to have a complete picture, and I appreciate your honesty. Fatigue, memory issues, occasional unsteadiness, and constipation are all relevant details. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Medical history… Let me see. I had my prostate acting up years ago, had that taken care of. High blood pressure, doctor always nagged me about that, been on pills for ages. And… oh, yeah. Had a bad heart scare about ten years ago, they put in a stent. Other than that… nothing major, as far as I recall. Widowed, you know. My wife took care of all the paperwork. I just go to the appointments.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. That's very helpful. History of prostate issues, hypertension managed with medication, and a stent placement ten years ago are all important. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. The blood pressure pills, definitely. And… the doctor gave me something for my cholesterol, a little orange one. I think it’s called… Atorvastatin? Something like that. Oh, and I take a baby aspirin every day, he said it's good for the heart. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. That’s it, I think. Don't ask me the dosages, I haven't the foggiest. My daughter handles all that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. That’s very helpful. So that’s Atorvastatin for cholesterol, daily aspirin for heart health, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. We can verify the dosages with your pharmacy records. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little indigestion sometimes, but that's just from eating too much garlic. My wife used to say I was part Italian, part garlic. Seriously, though, no allergies. Never had a problem. Don't waste my time with that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. No known allergies. Now, finally, let’s briefly touch on your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tough one. My parents are both gone, years ago. My father had… something with his heart, I think. Died young, actually. My mother lived to be old, but she just… faded away. Can't remember any specifics. Lots of Italians on both sides, though. And they all liked to eat. That's about all I know. Look, I'm not a medical historian, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. That's perfectly alright. History of heart issues in your father is useful to note. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will help me assess your overall condition and try to determine the cause of the shaking. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, an exam. Fine, get it over with. But don’t poke around too much, I bruise easily. And hurry up, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your pulse and temperature are within normal limits. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a mild murmur, which we’ve likely known about for some time. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to check your neurological function. I’m going to assess your reflexes, coordination, and muscle strength. Could you please extend your arms in front of you with your palms up?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. See? Shaking! What did I tell you? It's right here. Don't need an exam to see it, lady. But go ahead, poke around if you must. Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: I see the tremor is present, Mr. Baide, and I’ve noted the mild unsteadiness in your gait. Your strength and reflexes are normal. I’m also noting some slight rigidity in your arms. Based on the information you’ve provided and the findings of this brief examination, several possibilities come to mind. The tremor, rigidity, and slightly unsteady gait, combined with your age, could be indicative of essential tremor. However, given your history of heart issues and the presence of a murmur, we need to rule out other potential causes. To help us determine the best course of action, I would like to order a few blood tests and an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to assess your heart function. I'd also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests, more doctors. Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. But don't expect miracles. I’m eighty years old. Probably just old age. Whatever it is, just make it stop shaking, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to find a solution. I will order the blood tests and ECG today. The results should be available within a few days. I will also prepare a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if the shaking becomes significantly worse or you experience any other new symptoms, such as difficulty walking, slurred speech, or changes in your vision, please contact my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get me out of here. I’m tired. And I need a coffee. A strong one. Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but honestly, I’m not expecting much good news. Just… call my daughter, she handles all this paperwork. Her number is… uh… Here, it’s on this receipt somewhere. Don't bother calling me with the results. Just talk to her.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I will contact your daughter, Sarah, with the results and any further recommendations. And I understand your preference not to be contacted directly. Here is a summary of our discussion and the planned next steps for your records. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you a good afternoon, and I hope you are able to enjoy your coffee. If anything changes, please don't hesitate to contact the office.
