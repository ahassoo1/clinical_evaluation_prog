DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor... Finco, yes? Just moved here, you see. Needed to… find a doctor. Medicare, they told me to come here. Not much wrong, really. Old age, I think. Everything hurts a little, but who doesn’t have that?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Welcome to the area, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very common for things to ache a bit as we get older. But let’s talk about where it hurts, and what that pain is like, just to get a better picture. Could you tell me more about the areas that are bothering you the most?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where… It’s… everywhere, a little bit. Back, mostly. And my knees. They make noise. Like… old wood. Not bad noise, just… present. I used to be very active, you know? Did a lot of… stage work. Makeup, mostly. But that was a long time ago. Don’t remember exactly when anymore. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Mr. Szmyd. Stage work… that sounds interesting! And yes, knowing about your past activity level is important, it gives me a good starting point. So, the back and knees are the main areas of discomfort. And you said the knee pain is accompanied by noise… Is that noise constant, or only when you move?
PATIENT: Only when I move. When I sit still… it’s okay. Sometimes, though, even when I'm still, I feel a little… twinge. Like someone is poking me. Not hard, you understand? Just… there. And the back, that’s more of a… dull ache. Always there, background noise, you could say. Like a radio left on low. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make perfect sense, Mr. Szmyd. A dull ache, like a radio on low… that’s a very good description. And a twinge in the knees even when you're still. Okay. To help me understand a little better, can you tell me how long you’ve been experiencing this pain – both the ache and the twinge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Long time. Very long time. Years, I think. Maybe… five years? Ten? Everything is blurring these days. I stopped doing the stage work around then, I think. It was… tiring. The travel. And the… people. Not very nice sometimes, you know? Did I tell you I was divorced? Twice! Both times… a lot of drama. But that’s not important, is it? The pain, yes. It just… grew, slowly, over time.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, Mr. Szmyd. It's perfectly fine to share whatever feels relevant. And it is helpful to understand the bigger picture, if you're comfortable. So, about five to ten years with this pain, gradually increasing. And it started around the time you stopped the stage work. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam – just to check your range of motion, feel your joints, and get a better sense of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Exam? You want to… touch me? Is this necessary? I mean, I told you it’s just old age. Everything hurts. What good will poking and prodding do? I don’t like being touched, you know. Especially not by… strangers. I’m a sensitive person. Very sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Szmyd. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. And you're right, it may be just “old age,” as you say. However, a quick exam simply helps me rule out anything more serious, or identify the source of the pain more precisely. It helps me make sure we're not missing something. It’s not about thinking there is something terrible, it’s just a standard part of understanding what’s going on. I will be very gentle, and explain everything I’m doing as I go. And you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. We can absolutely skip any part of the exam you don’t want to do. How about we start with just looking at your knees – no touching yet – and seeing how they look while you're sitting?
PATIENT: Looking… that’s okay. I don't like the idea of touching. My knees are… knees. They bend. Sometimes they crack. They are not very pretty, you know. Worked hard, those knees. A lot of kneeling. For the costumes. It was very demanding work. Are you judging my knees? People are always judging.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Szmyd. I'm not judging your knees in the slightest. In fact, they look… well, they look like knees that have lived a full life! Knees that have done a lot of work. And cracking knees are very common, as we get older. I notice a little bit of swelling around both knees, and some redness. It’s not significant, but I'm noting it. Now, could I gently feel your knees, just to assess the range of motion and tenderness?
PATIENT: Tender? Oh, everything is tender. Fine. But gentle, you promised. And don’t poke! Just… brush. Like a feather. A very light feather. I don’t want any surprises. And tell me what you're doing, before you do it. Don’t just… touch.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Very gentle, just like a feather. I promise no poking. I'll tell you exactly what I’m doing before I do it. Okay, I'm just going to gently place my hands on your knees to feel the temperature. Just to get a baseline. Alright, both knees feel warm. Now, I'm going to gently bend and straighten each knee a little bit, just to check your range of motion. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort during this. I’ll start with the right knee. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Right knee… fine. But slowly, please. Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable. It creaks. Like an old door. And it feels… tight. Like a rusty hinge. Be careful, you might break it. I need these knees, you know? For… walking. And for… remembering things. It’s all connected, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does creak. And I hear you about the tightness. I’ll be very careful. It sounds like there is some stiffness. I am stopping now. And yes, I completely understand that everything is connected. The pain can definitely affect your ability to walk and even your memory. Now, let’s try the left knee, just the same as before, very gently. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Another knee? Do you have to? It’s all the same, you know. Creaky and tight. What good will poking them both do? I’m starting to feel… anxious. This is too much. I think I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: You’re right to tell me, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like this is making you uncomfortable, and I absolutely respect that. We can stop the exam right here. Your comfort is the most important thing. I apologize for causing you anxiety. It seems like you are experiencing a good deal of stiffness and creaking in both knees. Based on what you’ve told me – the long-term ache, the occasional twinge, the stiffness, and the noise – it sounds like you may have some osteoarthritis, which is very common as we age. It’s a gradual wearing down of the cartilage in your joints. Would you like to discuss some potential options for managing the pain – things like gentle exercise, over-the-counter pain relievers, or perhaps a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Managing? Oh, good. That’s good. I don't want any… drastic things. Just… less pain. I used to take little pills, for the pain. But I don’t remember what they were called. And they made me… sleepy. No sleepy pills, please. Exercise… I don't know. I’m not very… active anymore. Walking is hard enough. Maybe something… gentle? Like… waving my hands? Is there a pill for waving my hands?
DOCTOR: No pill for waving your hands, I’m afraid, though it's a very good start! Gentle exercise is a great idea, and we can certainly start small. Things like walking for a few minutes each day, or doing some simple stretches, can really help to improve your flexibility and reduce pain. As for the pills you were taking, don't worry about remembering the name right now. We can look up your medication history if you like. If you're concerned about side effects, there are many different options for pain relief, including over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. We can discuss the risks and benefits of each one, and find something that’s right for you. Would you like me to check your medication history now, or would you prefer to think about it and we can discuss it next time?
PATIENT: Medication history… I think I have a list somewhere. In a box. In the attic. It’s a very messy attic. Full of costumes. And old photographs. I haven't been up there in years. It’s too much trouble. Maybe… no. Let's not bother with the pills. Just… gentle exercise. What kind of gentle exercise? Is there a special chair for gentle exercise? I'm not very good at… balancing. And I don’t want to fall. That would be… dramatic.
DOCTOR: No, let’s not bother with the list for now. An attic full of costumes does sound like a lot of work! And we can absolutely focus on gentle exercise that doesn't require balancing. Falling would be dramatic. There are many exercises you can do sitting in a chair, which is a very safe option. Simple things like marching in place, gentle leg extensions, or arm raises can all be helpful. I have some handouts with pictures and instructions that I can give you. I also think it would be a good idea to consider a referral to a physical therapist. They can create a customized exercise plan for you, based on your individual needs and abilities, and teach you how to do the exercises safely and effectively. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Physical… what did you say? It sounds… complicated. And expensive. I’m on Medicare, you know. They don’t cover everything. I don't want any surprises on the bill. And I don't want to go to… more doctors. This is enough doctor for one day. Maybe… just the handout. With the pictures. If it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A handout is a perfect place to start. It's not too much trouble at all. And you're right to ask about Medicare coverage – that’s very important. I’ll make a note to have the receptionist check with your insurance about physical therapy coverage, just in case you decide to pursue it later. Here you go. These are some simple exercises you can start with, just a few repetitions each. Remember to listen to your body, and stop if you feel any pain. So, to recap: We’ve discussed osteoarthritis as a possible cause of your pain, and decided to start with gentle chair exercises. I’ve given you a handout with instructions, and the receptionist will check on Medicare coverage for physical therapy. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Not too drastic. Sensible is good. Chair exercises… I suppose I can manage that. As long as they don't involve too much… waving. My hands get tired easily. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… patient. And you haven’t poked me too much. That’s a plus. I think I’m ready to go home now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I'm glad I could help. And you’re right to point out no unnecessary poking! It sounds like you’ve had a long day. Here’s my card with the clinic’s number. Feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns, or if your pain worsens. And remember to start slowly with the exercises, and listen to your body. Take care, Mr. Szmyd. Have a good day, and a safe trip home.
