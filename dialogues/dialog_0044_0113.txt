DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Asami, you say? Hmm. Well, it's this… this going to the bathroom business. Seems I’m going a lot. More than I used to, that’s for sure. It’s… bothersome, to put it mildly. Not a big deal, I suppose, just… frequent. My wife keeps nagging me about it, that’s why I’m here, really. She says I’m going too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be bothersome, and it’s good you’re addressing it. It's always a good idea to get these things checked out, and it’s smart of your wife to encourage you to come in. Now, when you say “a lot,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… it's not like I'm constantly running to the toilet, Doctor. But… throughout the day, several times. More than… well, when I was younger, certainly. Before my wife started counting, I suppose. It’s hard to say exactly how much more. I don't keep track of these things. And at night… I wake up a couple of times. Just a couple. Enough to be annoying. Does that help? I’m not good with numbers, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does help, thank you. Waking up a couple of times at night is certainly something we need to consider. And the increase throughout the day… okay. To get a clearer picture, could you estimate how many times you’d say you’re going to the bathroom during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re asking for the impossible! Estimating… hmm. Let me see… I have my morning coffee, then… after breakfast. Then… well, when I’m working in the garden, I usually have to go. And… before lunch. After lunch, maybe. And… before dinner. And, well, a couple of times after dinner. Is that… is that helpful? I don’t know. It feels like a lot but I haven’t actually counted. You’re asking an old man to remember things he doesn’t pay attention to.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Segretto. It sounds like it could be anywhere between six to eight times a day, give or take. We'll work with that. And you mentioned gardening – do you notice any connection between activity and needing to go?
PATIENT: Activity, you say? Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, I suppose so. When I’m bending and stooping, digging in the dirt… yes. Definitely feels like it makes me need to go sooner. And if I drink a lot when I’m out there, forget about it. That’s a mistake. Should probably drink less when I’m gardening, I suppose. My wife tells me that all the time. “Stay hydrated,” she says. But then I have to go every five minutes! It's a catch-22, really.
DOCTOR: It sounds like there's a definite connection with activity and fluid intake, and your wife is right to encourage hydration, but we need to find a balance. Okay, let’s talk about what you drink throughout the day. What do you typically drink?
PATIENT: Well, coffee in the morning, of course. Can’t start the day without that. Then… water, mostly. Sometimes juice with lunch. And… sometimes a beer with dinner. Nothing fancy. I used to drink more, but my wife… well, she keeps an eye on things. She’s a good woman, but she likes to control everything. Not that I mind too much. Mostly water, though. And coffee. A good, strong Ukrainian coffee. None of that weak stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee, water, some juice, and a beer with dinner. The coffee is something we should definitely consider, as it can be a diuretic, meaning it makes you produce more urine. Now, besides the frequent urination, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Diuretic, you say? Makes you… pee more? Well, that explains a lot. Maybe I should cut back on the coffee. Though I don’t know how much to cut back. It's… a habit, you see. As for other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes, when I’m trying to go, it takes a little while to get started. A little hesitation. Not painful, just… slow. And sometimes, it doesn't feel like I empty everything completely. Does that make sense? My wife says I take too long in the bathroom. She doesn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Segretto. Hesitation starting the stream, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… those are important details. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not at all. Burning… no, not that either. It’s just… inconvenient, you see? And a little embarrassing. Having to get up in the middle of the night, having to go so often… it's not what it used to be, that’s for sure. My wife always makes a fuss, asking if I’m alright, if I’m getting enough sleep. It’s all very… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning. Good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me think. I had my prostate checked a few years back, but the doctor said it was fine. Just… old man stuff, he said. I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, that’s why I walk with a cane sometimes. And my blood pressure… it gets a little high sometimes. My wife keeps an eye on that too. She’s always taking my blood pressure. I think that’s all. I haven't been seriously ill, knock on wood. Nothing major, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a normal prostate check, some arthritis, and occasionally high blood pressure. Do you take any medications for your blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Medications… yes, let me see. For the blood pressure… I take a little pill, a white one. Every morning. My wife makes sure I don't forget. I think it’s called… Lisinopril? Something like that. And for the arthritis… sometimes, when it’s really bad, I take a little ibuprofen. But not very often. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They make me feel sluggish, you see? And my wife worries about side effects. She reads everything on the internet.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to any pills, that’s for sure. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a boy, but I haven’t been stung in years. And… no food allergies that I’m aware of. My wife makes sure I don’t eat anything that might be bad for me. She’s very careful, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had a weak heart. He died when he was fairly young, I think. My mother… she lived to be a very old woman. She had arthritis, like me. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he didn't take care of himself. He smoked too much and drank too much. That’s about all I can remember. My family wasn’t very good about talking about these things, you see? It was considered… private.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your father, arthritis in your mother, and diabetes in your brother. Thank you. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask one more question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would have my hide if I even thought about it. She’s very… particular about health. Always telling me to eat my vegetables and get enough sleep. She's a good woman, but sometimes she's a bit much, you see? No, no smoking. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned earlier, I have a beer with dinner most nights. Just one. Sometimes two if it's a special occasion. Nothing fancy, you see. A nice Ukrainian beer. My wife doesn’t mind, as long as I don’t overdo it. She knows I enjoy it. It helps me relax, you see. But I don’t drink to excess. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Okay, one or two beers with dinner. Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to conduct a quick physical exam. We'll start with checking your blood pressure and pulse, then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also want to do a quick abdominal exam, and then a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… well, I suppose so. Blood pressure and pulse, that’s fine. Listening to my heart and lungs, alright. But… a digital rectal exam? Now hold on a minute. Is that really necessary? I’ve never had one of those before. It sounds… unpleasant. My wife always tells me to ask questions if I don't understand something. Is there another way to check my prostate? It sounds… invasive, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's a perfectly reasonable question. A digital rectal exam is the most accurate way to assess the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It allows me to feel for any abnormalities that might not be visible on other tests. We can consider other tests like a PSA blood test, which measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, but it’s not as accurate and can sometimes give false positives, leading to unnecessary worry and further testing. The exam itself is quick, and while it may be uncomfortable, it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll explain everything as I go and we can stop at any time if you’re feeling too uncomfortable. However, given your age and symptoms, it’s an important part of the evaluation process. It will help me determine if further investigation is needed. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… that doesn’t sound very pleasant at all. False positives, you say? Unnecessary worry… My wife always says I should listen to the doctor, but this… this sounds dreadful. Explain it, you say? I suppose I should know what you’re going to do. But I’m not promising anything. And if it gets too uncomfortable, I’m stopping it. Right then and there. My wife will be very understanding, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I completely understand your concerns, and I respect your right to stop at any time. Essentially, you’ll lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricated, gloved finger to gently insert into your rectum. This allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. I'll be checking for any tenderness, lumps, or irregularities. The entire procedure will only take a minute or two. I’ll explain each step as I go and will be as gentle as possible. We can also pause and take a break if needed. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A minute or two, you say? Well, I suppose that’s not too long. And you’ll explain everything as you go? And I can stop it if it’s too uncomfortable? Very uncomfortable? Promise me you won't push if I ask you to stop. My wife… well, she’s going to want to know how it went. And she'll want to know if I listened to the doctor. So… alright. Let's get it over with. But be gentle, you hear? Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I promise to be as gentle as possible and will stop immediately if you ask me to. Your comfort is my priority. Okay, I’m going to apply a little lubricant now. It will make things more comfortable. Just relax your muscles and take deep breaths. This might feel a little strange, but shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. Just taking a look now… everything feels normal so far… I'm checking the size and shape of your prostate… just a little further… Okay… The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious lumps or tenderness. It feels symmetrical… everything appears to be within normal limits, but given the enlargement, we’ll want to run some additional tests to get a clearer picture. Okay, that’s all for now. You can sit up slowly. How are you feeling, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Well… that wasn't as bad as I expected, I suppose. A little uncomfortable, yes. A bit strange. But not… dreadful. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is that bad? And additional tests, you say? What kind of tests? I don't like tests. My wife is going to want to know all about this. She'll want to read everything on the internet, you see. Is it serious, Doctor? You're not trying to scare me, are you?
DOCTOR: I'm glad it wasn't as bad as you anticipated, Mr. Segretto. It's very common for the prostate to enlarge with age – it's a natural part of the aging process. We call it Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH for short. It means the prostate is simply getting bigger, which can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting the stream, or incomplete emptying. It’s not cancer, and it’s not necessarily serious. However, we need to rule out other possibilities and assess the severity of the enlargement. I’d like to order a few tests: a PSA blood test, which measures your prostate-specific antigen level; a urinalysis to check for infection; and a post-void residual test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. We may also consider an ultrasound of your bladder and prostate, if needed. These tests will help us determine the best course of action. It could range from simply monitoring your symptoms to medication or, in some cases, a minor procedure. I am not trying to scare you, Mr. Segretto. We’re just being thorough. We caught this early, and there are many effective treatments available. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Not cancer, you say? That’s good. Very good. Enlarged, not cancer… My wife will be happy to hear that. Blood tests, urine tests… I suppose I can handle that. And an ultrasound, you say? Does that involve… lying down? I don’t like lying down for too long. My knees… they ache. And medication? What kind of medication? Any side effects? My wife reads all about side effects on the internet. She’s very… cautious. So, no immediate danger, you’re saying? We’re just… checking things out? And the tests will tell you more? That sounds… reasonable. Reasonable, yes. I just hope it doesn’t involve too much lying down. My knees, you see…
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, you're right. We're just checking things out. No immediate danger at all. And the tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. The ultrasound is non-invasive and involves lying on your back for a short period. We can position you comfortably and make sure you’re supported. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. If your knees bother you, we can use pillows for support. The medication options typically involve alpha-blockers or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Alpha-blockers relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors shrink the prostate gland over time. Both medications can have side effects, which is understandable your wife is cautious about. Common side effects of alpha-blockers can include dizziness or lightheadedness, while 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can sometimes cause sexual dysfunction. However, not everyone experiences these side effects, and we can discuss the risks and benefits of each medication before making any decisions. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for the blood tests, urinalysis, and ultrasound. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Blood tests, urine tests, ultrasound… and then another appointment. It’s a lot, you see? A lot of appointments. My wife is going to be very busy scheduling things. Pillows for my knees, you say? That’s good. I appreciate that. And you’ll discuss the side effects of the pills before I take them? She’ll be very pleased to hear that. She always wants to know everything beforehand. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Less coffee, you said? Drink less when I’m gardening? Anything else? I just want to… be prepared. And make my wife happy. That’s important. Very important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, that’s perfectly understandable. It is a lot, but we’ll take it one step at a time. In the meantime, yes, reducing your coffee intake and drinking less when you're gardening would be helpful. And try to avoid drinking fluids close to bedtime to reduce nighttime urination. You can also try practicing pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These exercises help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and prostate, which can improve urinary control. Most importantly, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, chills, pain, or difficulty urinating. We’ll review all the test results at your follow-up appointment and create a personalized treatment plan that’s right for you. We’ll discuss all your options and address any concerns you or your wife may have. Here’s a handout with information on BPH and Kegel exercises. And the nurse will schedule your appointments before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Kegel exercises… hmm. I suppose I can try those. My wife always says I need more exercise. She’s probably right. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly, Doctor. And you've been very patient with my… questions. My wife will be very pleased. She likes doctors who explain things clearly. Thank you, Doctor Asami. I appreciate your help. And I’ll try to remember everything you’ve told me. Although… my memory isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I'm glad I could help. And don’t worry about remembering everything – that’s what the handouts are for, and your wife can certainly help too! And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. We’re here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your appointments and provide any additional information you may need. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Segretto. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. And… goodbye.
