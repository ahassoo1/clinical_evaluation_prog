DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… cough. I got cough. Long time already. And… tired also. Very tired. Feels like… sick always, in the head. Sinus, I think they call it? I keep getting it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. A long-standing cough and fatigue, and you suspect sinus issues. Could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: Um… it’s… wet cough. Lots of… stuff coming out. Sometimes yellow, sometimes clear. Mostly in the morning, very bad. Then… little better, but never really gone. I try drink water, but… doesn’t really help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a productive cough with varying sputum color – yellow and clear – worse in the mornings. And it doesn’t fully resolve with increased fluids. Has this cough been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… I think. Hard to remember. Maybe worse in the rainy season? We got lots of rain lately. But… it’s always there, a little bit. Never really stop. My wife says I cough in my sleep also.
DOCTOR: So it fluctuates in severity, potentially correlating with the rainy season, but is always present to some degree, even disturbing your sleep. That’s helpful information. And you mentioned feeling tired – can you describe that fatigue?
PATIENT: Uh… just… no energy. Like… heavy. Even after sleep, still feel tired. Hard to do things. Hard to work. I fix tire, you know? Need strong. Now… not so strong. Sometimes I just… sit. And rest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent lack of energy, even after rest, affecting your ability to work. It sounds very debilitating, Mr. Tati. Now, besides the cough and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other things… let me think. Sometimes… my nose blocked. Very blocked. Then… runny. A lot of running. And… ache, in my face? Around my eyes, I think. And… maybe little fever sometimes? Not big fever. Just… warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea – a runny nose – facial pain around the eyes, and occasional subjective fevers. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… no. Not really. Chest pain… no. Night sweats… uh… maybe? My wife say I sweat a lot. But… I live in hot place, you know? Always hot. Hard to tell.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, living in a hot climate makes differentiating that symptom difficult. Now, Mr. Tati, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… uh… not much. I don’t go to doctor often. I try to fix myself. When I young, I got… chickenpox. And maybe… flu, sometimes? Nothing big. No serious… sickness. I work hard, eat rice, sleep. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a relatively unremarkable medical history. No chronic conditions, just childhood chickenpox and occasional flu-like illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never been in hospital. I… strong man. I fix tire. No need hospital.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my wife, two children. They healthy. My mother… she got cough sometimes, when old. And my father… he got… heart problem, long time ago. He passed away, many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your wife and children are healthy, your mother experiences occasional coughs, and your father had a history of heart problems. Do you know if anyone in your family has asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Asthma… uh… no. Not that I know. Allergies… maybe my wife. She sneeze sometimes with flowers. But… not big allergies. Just sneeze. I don’t think I got allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Tati, do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. My wife no like. And… not good for tire man. Need strong lungs.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… drink water. And… sometimes tea. My wife make good tea.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that information, Mr. Tati. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. You check. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.4°F . Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth… and exhale slowly. I hear some scattered wheezes in both lung fields, particularly in the lower lobes. Now, I’m going to palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. There is some tenderness upon palpation of your maxillary sinuses. And finally, I’ll take a look at your throat. Based on my examination, your lungs exhibit wheezing, which suggests some airway inflammation. The sinus tenderness indicates some degree of sinus involvement, and your throat is mildly inflamed. It appears you have symptoms consistent with bronchitis with possible sinus involvement. I would like to order a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia and a complete blood count to assess for infection. Are you able to go to a facility for imaging?
PATIENT: X-ray… uh… I can try. Is expensive? I don’t have much money. And blood count… that okay? I don't like needle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the blood draw. The X-ray will help us determine if there is any evidence of pneumonia. I will see if we can utilize a facility that offers a reduced rate or payment plan, given your financial situation. The blood count will provide us with more information about any potential infection. It is a small needle, and usually quick. If we can get the X-ray and blood work done today, we can discuss treatment options. However, given your symptoms, I recommend starting you on an albuterol inhaler to help open your airways and a course of antibiotics to address any potential bacterial infection. Would you be agreeable to starting those medications while we await the results of the tests?
PATIENT: Albuterol… inhaler? Like… spray in mouth? And antibiotics… pills? Okay. If help, I try. But… I scared of side effect.
DOCTOR: Yes, albuterol is a spray you inhale to open your airways. It can sometimes cause slight shakiness or a racing heart, but those side effects are usually mild and temporary. The antibiotics, in pill form, can sometimes cause stomach upset, so it's best to take them with food. We will start with a low dose, and I will discuss possible side effects in detail. I will write you prescriptions for both medications. If the symptoms worsen or you develop a fever above 101°F , please seek immediate medical attention. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the test results and assess your progress. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. My wife say I can eat anything. I think. I never got sick from medicine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Tati, here are your prescriptions for the albuterol inhaler and the antibiotics. Please be sure to follow the instructions carefully. I'm also providing you with a written summary of our discussion, including potential side effects and a list of warning signs to watch out for. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. I hope the medicine help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tati. I hope so too. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any concerns or your symptoms worsen, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and please take care.
