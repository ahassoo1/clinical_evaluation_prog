DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t even feel different. It’s probably nothing. Just paperwork, right? Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is not a diagnosis we aim for, Ms. Dudeney. While you may not feel different, elevated blood pressure is something we need to investigate. The nurse is simply alerting me to the initial reading. It could be a temporary elevation due to stress, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, let's start with some details. How long has the nurse been telling you your blood pressure is high?
PATIENT: Well, she checked it twice. Yesterday, and then again when I got here. So… a day? Look, I work a lot. Civil engineering isn’t exactly a relaxing job, you know? Lots of deadlines, lots of… people. It’s probably just that. Is there a form I need to sign saying it’s stress?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, a stressful job can contribute to high blood pressure, certainly. But we can't simply assume that's the cause without proper evaluation. We need to get a complete picture. Before we discuss forms, let's go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or any other medical conditions, for that matter?
PATIENT: No. Never. And my husband makes sure I go to the dentist, if that matters. He's very… organized. Look, I eat okay, I guess. Not a lot of junk food. I don’t sit around all day, I’m always doing something. This seems like a waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No previous diagnoses. That’s helpful. And your husband ensures regular dental checkups – good. Those are indicators of general health awareness, I suppose. Let’s move on to your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has a history of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: My mom… she always complained about being tired, but she worked a lot too. Just a waitress her whole life. Dad was fine, I think. He was a carpenter. Didn’t really talk about health stuff. Grandparents… they’re gone now. A long time ago. Mostly just… old age. Does that answer your question? Can we speed this up? I have a site visit this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history, then. It's not ideal, but we'll proceed. Now, medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just… allergy pills, sometimes. Seasonal stuff. And a multivitamin, but that's it. My husband gets it for both of us. It's got, like, all the letters. You know, A, C, E… all of them. Honestly, I don’t pay that much attention. It’s a little orange pill. Is that all? Can we talk about fixing this, instead of just listing everything?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand your frustration, but these details are essential for determining the best course of action. We need to rule out any potential interactions or contributing factors. Let's proceed with a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again to confirm the initial readings. Then, depending on those results, we may need to order some blood work. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I really don’t have time for this. Is there a waiting room with better chairs? These are… uncomfortable. And can you hurry?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat here. I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. And I apologize for the chairs; we are aware they are not ideal. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally… again, deep breath… and exhale. Blood pressure is 152/94. Confirmed elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. As I suspected, your blood pressure remains elevated. This requires further investigation. We'll need to draw some blood to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other underlying causes.
PATIENT: Blood work? Seriously? Look, I told you it was stress. Can't you just… give me something for stress? A pill, a shot, something? I don't have time for a whole lab visit. This is ridiculous. My husband is going to be furious if I miss the site meeting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I appreciate your desire for a quick solution, but prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible – and potentially harmful. “Stress” is a symptom, not a diagnosis. We need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before considering any treatment. We're not simply looking for a pill to mask a problem; we’re attempting to identify the root cause. The blood work is a standard procedure, and it will provide vital information. It will take approximately 30 minutes. Unless you have a medical reason preventing it, I strongly advise we proceed with the blood work today. It’s the most responsible course of action. Do you consent to the procedure?
PATIENT: Fine! Yes, fine. Whatever. Just... get it over with. Thirty minutes. Don't make it longer. And I expect a very detailed explanation after. I don't want a bunch of medical jargon, either. Explain it like I’m five. And hurry, please. I have things to do. This is wasting my entire afternoon. Can I at least get a glass of water?
DOCTOR: Very well. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly to draw the blood. A glass of water is on its way. Please, sit and relax while you wait. I will review the results as soon as they are available and explain them to you in a clear and understandable manner. And I assure you, I will avoid the "medical jargon" as you requested. I will be back shortly.
