DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning. Chest… feels funny. Like a bird flapping, you know? And my head… pounding. Blood pressure always high, wife says so. Always checking. Waste of time, if you ask me. Just old age.
DOCTOR: A “bird flapping,” alright. And you said your head is pounding… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I get… upset. Wife, you know? Always nagging. It’s not… serious. Just… annoying. I don't need a long talk about stress, Doctor. I just want to know if my heart is going to… stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No lectures, I promise. But ignoring something because it's “annoying” isn’t usually the best approach. We need to figure out why your chest feels that way and why your head is pounding. Has this been happening long?
PATIENT: Long? A while. Years. Maybe five, six years? It comes and goes, like I said. I take my pills… the little white ones… wife makes sure of it. Doesn't always help, though. What do you need to know exactly? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Those “little white ones” – do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. She gets them. From the… pharmacy. Little blue building down the street. I just… take them. Don't ask me to spell it. I’m old, not stupid. Just… the white pills. Enough with the questions.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's try a different approach then. Aside from the chest and the headaches, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I get tired easily. Everything makes me tired. Walking… even watching TV. And sometimes… my hands get shaky. Especially when I try to eat. Makes a mess, you know? Wife gets upset then too.
DOCTOR: Shaky hands… and fatigue. Do you notice the shakiness and fatigue at any particular time of day, or is it constant?
PATIENT: Mostly… in the afternoon. After lunch. I eat a big lunch. Wife makes good food. But then… I just feel weak. Like I could fall over. It's not good. Makes me nervous, and then everything gets worse. The chest… the head… the shaking.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned your wife checks your blood pressure frequently. Do you know what those readings typically are?
PATIENT: She says… high. Always says high! Over… one-forty, she says. Sometimes… even higher. I don’t pay attention to the numbers. Numbers are for… young people. She worries too much. Just tell me if I’m going to drop dead, Doctor. That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration. But simply telling you whether or not you're "going to drop dead" isn't good medical care. I need to examine you, listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe do a few tests to figure out what's going on. It's a quick process. Can we start with that?
PATIENT: Tests? Hmph. More waiting. I don't like tests. But… fine. Get it over with. Just don’t keep me long. And no needles. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the exam table. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. In… and out… good. A little raspy on both sides, but nothing alarming at first listen. Blood pressure is… 158 over 92. Your wife is correct, it's elevated. Do you experience any shortness of breath when you lie down?
PATIENT: Shortness of… what? Like I can't get enough air? Sometimes. When I watch TV. I like action movies… lots of yelling. Then I get… winded. Especially if the wife is talking at the same time. She doesn't understand… too much excitement is bad for an old man.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you feel any swelling in your ankles or feet at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmph. Sometimes. My shoes feel… tighter. Wife says it's the water. She makes me drink… a lot of water. Says it’s good for everything. Doesn't seem to help, though. Just have to loosen my shoes. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: I’d like to check your reflexes and strength, just quickly. And then I think we should order some blood work. A basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. It will give us a better understanding of what's going on with your kidneys, electrolytes, and overall health. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Reflexes? What for? I told you, I'm just old. Everything is… slowing down. Blood work… more waiting. And poking. I don’t like being poked. Can’t I just take an extra pill or something? Wife always says pills fix everything.
DOCTOR: The reflexes help me assess your nervous system. It’s not about fixing things with just another pill, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's about understanding why you're feeling this way. The blood work will take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription to continue your current medication, and I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. No. Never had allergies. I eat everything. Wife makes sure I get a balanced diet. Although… sometimes my stomach gets upset after I eat spicy food. But that's just… spicy food. Can I have a glass of water now? My throat is dry. All this talking.
DOCTOR: <stage>scribbles a note on the chart: "Assess tolerance to spicy foods. Possible GERD?
PATIENT: Here's a glass of water. Now, about your diet… I understand your wife is very diligent about ensuring you have a balanced meal. That's excellent. Just try to avoid anything too spicy, for now. And I'll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. One week from today. Do you have any questions for me before I finish up?
