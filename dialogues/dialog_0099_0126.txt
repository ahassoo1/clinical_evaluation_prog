DOCTOR: Right, Christen Erxleben, 32 years old. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, constantly. It’s quite disruptive, really. I seem to be drinking and eating all the time, and it doesn’t even feel like it’s helping.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry, constantly… and it’s not satisfying you. Okay. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… at least a month, I’d say. Maybe six weeks? It started gradually, just feeling a bit peckish more often, needing a sip of water here and there. But it's definitely gotten worse in the last two or three weeks. I’m not sure if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful to know. Gradual onset, worsening over the past few weeks. And besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes? Let me see. I suppose I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more often, if I'm honest. Both… number one and number two, actually. Not a huge amount more, but noticeable. And… I've been a little tired, now that you mention it. Just generally feeling a bit run down, I suppose. Nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: Increased urination and fatigue… Alright. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss, blurry vision, or any skin changes – perhaps increased itching or slow wound healing?
PATIENT: Weight loss… no, I don’t think so. If anything, I’ve probably gained a bit, with all the eating. Blurry vision… no, my eyesight’s been the same as always, I believe. And skin… no, nothing unusual there either. It’s been quite hot lately, so I’ve had a bit of a heat rash on my back, but that's just the weather, I'd imagine. Honestly, Doctor, I'm hoping it's nothing too serious. I've got a lot on my plate at work.
DOCTOR: Right. And what sort of work do you do?
PATIENT: I work in shipping and receiving. And inventory, mostly. It's a fairly physical job, always on my feet, moving boxes and checking deliveries. It can be quite stressful at times, keeping everything organized, especially with the… well, everything going on in the world, supply chain issues and all that. It requires a bit of focus, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A physical and mentally demanding job. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never been diagnosed with anything, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. I had a bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was it. And… my divorce was fairly stressful, if that counts as a medical condition. I try to keep fit and healthy, you see. I don't drink much, don't smoke.
DOCTOR: No known medical conditions, typical childhood illnesses, recent stressful life event. Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. I did break my arm when I was a child, fell out of a tree, but it healed perfectly fine. No hospitalizations as an adult, thankfully. I'm not a fan of hospitals, to be quite honest. They always smell a bit… clinical. If you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother is still alive, she's 78. She has a bit of arthritis, but otherwise she's fairly healthy. My father passed away a few years ago, he had… heart trouble, I believe. And my sister is fine, as far as I know. We don't see each other much these days, since the divorce. No history of diabetes or anything major on either side of the family, if that's what you're asking. It's all rather… unremarkable, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking anything at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just the occasional paracetamol for a headache, that's all. I try to tough things out, you see. Rely on a bit of rest and a cup of tea to sort myself out. That usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a quick look at you. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. We'll also do a quick blood sugar check, just to rule things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. As long as it doesn't take too long, if you don't mind. I have a rather tight schedule today, you see. But yes, go ahead. I'll cooperate fully. I’m just hoping it’s nothing serious, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 88, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, for a quick blood sugar check. Okay, your blood sugar is 210 mg/dL. That’s elevated. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: 210? Elevated? Goodness. That doesn't sound good, does it? Investigate further… what does that entail, exactly? I mean, are we talking… tests? Injections? I really do have a lot on my plate, as I mentioned. Is it… serious? Could it be something I ate? I had a rather large slice of cake at my nephew's birthday party last weekend…
DOCTOR: Yes, 210 is significantly elevated. It could be related to something you ate, but it's high enough that we need to rule out other possibilities. It could indicate diabetes, but we need further testing to confirm that. We’ll need a fasting blood sugar test, and an A1C test, which gives us an average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. We'll also need a urine sample to check for ketones. I'll write you a requisition for these tests. The lab is just down the hall. It's a fairly straightforward process. As for injections… we're not talking about injections yet. We need to know what we're dealing with first. But if it is diabetes, treatment options could include lifestyle changes, medication, and, in some cases, insulin injections. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fasting blood sugar… A1C… ketones… It sounds rather… complicated. And a bit frightening, to be honest. Lifestyle changes… medication… injections… It’s all a bit overwhelming. Right. So, tests first. That's… sensible, I suppose. The lab down the hall… is it a long wait? I really do have a meeting this afternoon, and I promised my former… my ex-wife, I mean, to pick up our daughter later. Could it be something else? Something less… serious? Perhaps a virus? Or… stress? I have been quite stressed lately.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, but the elevated blood sugar is concerning enough that we need to investigate properly. Stress can temporarily elevate blood sugar, but not to this degree. A virus is a possibility, but it typically resolves on its own. The lab should be relatively quick; expect a wait of around 30-45 minutes. Take this requisition with you. Once you have the results, you can either schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or I can review them remotely through the patient portal. I understand you have commitments, but your health is the priority. Ignoring this could lead to serious complications. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or how to prepare for them?
PATIENT: 30-45 minutes… Right. I suppose I have no choice, then. How… how long will it take to get the results? And what exactly are we looking for? Is it… is it something curable? Or… is it a lifelong thing? I just… I just want to know what I’m dealing with. And if I can still… still manage my workload, still pick up my daughter. This is… quite a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24-48 hours. The lab will likely send them directly to the patient portal, which you can access online. As for what we're looking for, the fasting blood sugar will confirm if your blood sugar is consistently elevated when you haven't eaten. The A1C test will give us a longer-term picture. Whether it's curable depends on the underlying cause and how well you manage it. If it is type 2 diabetes, it's often manageable with lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, weight loss – and medication. It's not necessarily a lifelong sentence, but it does require ongoing commitment. As for managing your workload and picking up your daughter… we'll need to see the results first. But if it is diabetes, you may need to adjust your schedule and prioritize your health. Ignoring this won't make it go away, and could lead to complications that will impact your ability to do those things. For now, focus on getting the tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… diet… exercise… It sounds… exhausting. I barely have time to sleep as it is. No… I think that’s all for now. Just… get the tests done. And wait. It’s just… a lot. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I’ll… I’ll see you when I have the results. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the tests done as soon as possible. And don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. .
