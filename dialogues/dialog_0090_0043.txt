DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it's this headache I've been getting. Right in the back of my head, you see? It's been… well, a little while now. Not constant, but it’s definitely bothersome when it comes.
DOCTOR: A little while now... could you be a bit more specific, Percell?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started maybe three, four weeks ago? Around the time my granddaughter started her summer job, I reckon. It comes and goes, like a summer rain. Some days I don’t feel a thing, others it’s just a dull ache. Not a sharp pain, thankfully. Just… there. Does that make any sense? I'm trying to remember exactly when it started, it's hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks, coinciding with your granddaughter’s job… alright. And you describe it as a dull ache in the back of your head. Does anything seem to bring it on, Percell?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, I think so. When I'm really focused on numbers, you know, working with clients' finances, it seems to get worse. I spend a lot of time staring at the screen, and sometimes I forget to blink, I suppose. Also, if I get really frustrated with a case, it tends to flare up too. It's like the tension goes right to the back of my head. I don't know if that makes sense, Doctor. It's just a feeling I have.
DOCTOR: Numbers and screen time...and frustration. Alright. And when you say “clients’ finances,” is this work you’re actively doing, or more of a hobby?
PATIENT: Oh, no, it’s my work. Been a financial advisor for… well, longer than I care to admit! I still enjoy it, most of the time. It keeps my mind sharp, you know? But it can be stressful, making sure people are secure. Lots of responsibility. It’s not a relaxing job, but it's important work. I have a small office downtown.
DOCTOR: I see. A financial advisor. That does explain the numbers. And the stress. Now, Percell, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Now that you ask… I have been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. Not sick tired, just… worn out. And sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when I’m really concentrating on something close up. It doesn’t last long, just a fleeting thing. But it’s been happening more lately. Does that sound important, Doctor? I try not to worry about things too much.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and blurry vision... those are good things to mention, Percell. And it's always good to mention changes. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite’s been… a little off, I guess. Not much of one, lately. I haven’t been eating as much as I used to. And I think I've lost a little weight, but I haven’t actually stepped on the scale to check. My clothes feel a little looser, that’s all. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more, but I just haven’t been hungry. It's not something I worry about too much. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: "Old age" isn’t a diagnosis, Percell. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask about some other things, just to get a full picture. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting, thankfully. And I haven’t been dizzy either. Steady as a rock, mostly. Sometimes a little lightheaded when I stand up too fast, but that's happened on and off for years. Nothing new. I’ve always had good balance, even though I’m… well, a bit older now. I still help my grandkids with their kites, you know. Needs a steady hand for that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your hearing or vision besides the blurriness we discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… my hearing… not really, I don't think. My daughter yells at me sometimes, but that’s just her. No, seriously, I haven’t noticed any big changes. As for my vision, well, it's not what it used to be, naturally. I need reading glasses now, but I’ve had those for a few years. Nothing sudden. Everything is still… reasonably clear, for an old man. I can still see my grandchildren's faces, that's what matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… When I was younger, I had a bit of a problem with my blood pressure, but it's been under control for years now, with some pills. Nothing major. The doctor told me to watch my salt intake. Other than that… no, not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I’ve been lucky. I had the flu a couple of times, but who hasn’t? And a broken wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But nothing serious. My daughter keeps telling me to get more check-ups, but I’m not one for doctors, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Percell?
PATIENT: Just the one, for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but not regularly. Just when I need it. Other than that, nothing. I prefer to stay away from pills if I can. Nature’s medicine is best, in my opinion. A good night’s sleep and a healthy diet, that’s what I believe in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me that, too. She worries a lot. But no, no allergies. I can eat anything, take most pills… well, except for the ones I don't want to take! Seriously, though, I’ve always been pretty tolerant. I haven't had any trouble with food or medications. I’ve been fortunate in that regard, too. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check. Can I check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I don't mind at all. Go right ahead. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… whatever it takes. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I’m used to poking and prodding, my daughter makes me do it all the time. Just try to be gentle, if you don't mind. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat here. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds…regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not alarming, but something to note. Lungs are clear. Thyroid feels normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright. Reflexes, you say? Go right ahead. I haven’t been tested for reflexes in… well, a long time, I reckon. I used to be quite nimble, you know. Played a good game of Jai Lai back in my day. But that was a long time ago. My joints aren't what they used to be. Don't expect too much, Doctor. I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little diminished, as expected. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, Percell, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Family history, that's a good question. My father… he had a bit of a heart problem towards the end of his life, but he lived to be a good age, 85. My mother… she had some trouble with her sugar, diabetes, I think. And my sister… she had cancer a few years back, but she recovered, thankfully. Other than that… not much that I can recall. We weren’t a family that talked about medical things much, if you know what I mean. It was more of a…keep it to yourself kind of thing. But those are the main things I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we finish, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. As for alcohol… I used to enjoy a beer with dinner now and then, but I haven’t had a drink in a long time. Maybe a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s about it. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never been interested in those. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I prefer a good cup of tea and a quiet evening with my family. And maybe a little gardening, if the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few things. Your headache, fatigue, blurry vision, slightly elevated blood pressure, and the murmur I detected in your heart... These things need to be investigated further. My initial concern is a possible cerebrovascular event, such as a transient ischemic attack or early signs of stroke, but we can’t rule out other possibilities like a space occupying lesion or early dementia. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. I also want to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. And finally, I want you to see a neurologist for a full neurological evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…serious, Doctor. A stroke? Dementia? I… I didn't expect all of this. I just thought it was a headache! A CT scan… neurological evaluation… That sounds like a lot. Is it… is it bad? What do I need to do? I don’t want to cause anyone any trouble. I just want to feel better. My daughter’s going to be so worried… What’s the first step? Do I need to go to the hospital now?
DOCTOR: Percell, try to remain calm. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. These tests are simply to rule things out and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’re being thorough. The CT scan will help us see if there are any abnormalities in your brain, such as bleeding or a tumor. The neurologist will perform a more detailed examination of your nervous system to assess your cognitive function, reflexes, and coordination. No, you do not need to go to the hospital immediately. We'll schedule these tests as quickly as possible, likely within the next few days. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for the CT scan and refer you to a neurologist. I'll also give you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin to help prevent any further blood clots while we wait for the results. In the meantime, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, vision changes, or severe headache, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A CT scan, neurologist, aspirin… monitor my symptoms… new or worsening symptoms means emergency room. It’s a lot to take in, but I’ll try to remember everything. My daughter… she’ll want to know everything. And I don't want to worry her unnecessarily. Could you… could you maybe write down the instructions, just so I’m sure I don’t forget anything? And maybe a little explanation of why we’re doing each test? Just… to help me understand. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, Doctor. It’s… reassuring, even if it’s a little scary. And thank you for writing it down. That would be a great help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Percell. Here you are. It includes a summary of our conversation, the tests we're ordering, and a brief explanation of each one. It also includes the signs and symptoms that warrant an immediate trip to the emergency room. It also has my contact information if you or your daughter have any questions. Don’t hesitate to call, alright?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is… very helpful. It explains everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. My daughter will be relieved to see this. You're a good doctor, Doctor Kur. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I really appreciate it. Is there anything else I need to do right now, or can I go home and discuss this with my daughter? I'm sure she'll want to come with me to the neurologist appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. No, there’s nothing else you need to do right now. Go home, discuss this with your daughter, and we'll get the appointments scheduled as quickly as possible. I’ll have my nurse call you tomorrow to confirm the appointment times and provide any additional information you may need. Please, do take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any changes in your condition. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, Percell. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I will. .
