DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Bombara. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? Gotta keep up with those, even if I feel fine.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to be proactive about your health, Ms. Fornes. Routine check-ups and immunizations are important. Just to be thorough, even with a routine visit, I like to get a little more detail. Do you have any specific concerns today, or is it just the immunizations we’re focusing on?
PATIENT: Just the shots, I think. Honestly, I haven't really noticed anything being off. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Work keeps me busy, though – construction can be hard on the body, you know? But nothing I can’t handle… usually.
DOCTOR: Construction work is demanding, certainly. Alright. To get a better picture of your overall health – and to make sure those immunizations are appropriate – let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for a while now?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It’s… complicated. I travel a lot with work, and it’s hard to stick with one doctor. And honestly, I haven’t had much luck finding someone I really connect with, you know? Mostly just go when something’s wrong, if that makes sense. This is nice, having a proper check-up for once.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Fornes. It can be difficult to establish consistent care, especially with a busy schedule and travel. No worries at all, we’ll start fresh. Let’s see… Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, not that I can recall. I broke my wrist a few years back, working on a roof, but that healed up fine. And I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. No serious illnesses, thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu, like everyone gets.
DOCTOR: Okay, wrist fracture, tonsillectomy as a child, and typical colds and flu. That’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mom, she had… I think it was high blood pressure, later in life. And my dad, he always had trouble with his knees, arthritis mostly. Nothing too serious, but they both slowed down a lot as they got older. I try to stay active, so I’m hoping to avoid that, you know?
DOCTOR: That's a good attitude to have, Ms. Fornes. Family history can be helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything, and haven't ever had a bad reaction to any medicine I've taken. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. Though I try to avoid bee stings, just like everyone else!
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if my muscles are sore after work, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular, just as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And to finish up with your history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never been much of a smoker, don’t really care for alcohol, and definitely not into any of that other stuff. I need a clear head for work, you know? Construction isn’t the place for… distractions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all very helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Dr. Bombara. Go right ahead. I’m pretty easygoing, so don’t worry about hurting my feelings if something feels a little uncomfortable. Just let me know what you’re doing, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Perfect. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. We’ll also take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within a normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay, good. Sounds good so far. I always worry about my blood pressure, my mom had issues with that, so it’s good to hear it’s alright. Go ahead with the reflexes then. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is also 5/5 in all extremities. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Everything seems normal so far, Ms. Fornes. Do you have any specific areas of concern – any pain, tenderness, or discomfort that you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, I feel pretty good. My shoulders get a little stiff sometimes, from lifting things at work, but that’s just part of the job. Nothing I can’t work through. And my lower back gets a little achy if I’ve been bending a lot, but a good night's sleep usually fixes that. Honestly, Dr. Bombara, I think I'm okay. A little creaky, maybe, but okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to hear. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you're in generally good health, Ms. Fornes. The shoulder and lower back discomfort is likely related to the physical demands of your job. Now, as we discussed, you mentioned routine immunizations. Do you know which ones you’re due for?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I honestly haven’t kept track. I think I had a tetanus shot a few years ago, when I stepped on a nail, but that’s the only one I can remember for sure. I guess I should probably get a flu shot, too, when those are available? And maybe a pneumonia shot? I always forget what I need…
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can review your immunization record and determine which ones you’re due for. I’ll check our system, and if we don’t have a record, we can discuss getting some baseline titers done to see your immunity levels. Okay… It looks like you received a Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertussis booster in 2022, which is good. Your influenza vaccine is up to date as of last fall, but you are due for a pneumococcal vaccine. Depending on your age and health status, there are a couple of different options. Would you prefer the PCV13 or the PPSV23 vaccine?
PATIENT: Oh, good, the tetanus one was recent. That’s a relief. Honestly, I don’t know anything about those other two… PCV13 or PPSV23? What's the difference? I trust your judgment, Dr. Bombara, I just want to make sure I’m protected. Is one better than the other, or do they do different things?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it's important to understand the difference. Both vaccines protect against pneumococcal disease, which can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. The PCV13 vaccine protects against 13 strains of pneumococcal bacteria, and is generally recommended as the first vaccine for most adults. The PPSV23 vaccine covers a broader range of strains, but isn’t always as effective. Given your age and overall health, I would recommend the PCV13 vaccine today. It provides excellent protection against the most common strains of pneumococcal bacteria. We can discuss the PPSV23 vaccine at your next visit, if you’d like. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, PCV13 sounds good. If you think that’s the best one for me, then I trust you. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. It’s nice to have a doctor who takes the time to actually tell you what’s going on. Let’s go ahead and do that one then. What does it involve? Is it just a shot, like the tetanus one?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is just a simple injection, like the tetanus shot. It may cause some mild soreness at the injection site, and you may experience some mild flu-like symptoms for a day or two, but it’s usually nothing serious. This will feel like a small pinch. All done. I've documented the vaccination in your chart. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: That wasn't bad at all! Just a little pinch, like you said. No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Dr. Bombara. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It's nice to finally have a doctor I can trust. When should I come back for my next check-up?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad I could help. I recommend you come back in one year for your annual check-up, or sooner if you experience any new or concerning symptoms. We’ll check your vital signs, review your health status, and discuss any necessary vaccinations. Here’s my card with the clinic’s contact information. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Fornes. Have a wonderful day! .
