DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have time for this, to be honest. It's my stomach, alright? Just…bloated. Feels full all the time, even when I haven’t eaten much. It's annoying, that's all. Can we just figure out what I need to take to make it stop?
DOCTOR: “Annoying” isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Kristofik. We need to understand why your stomach is bloated. It’s important to rule out anything serious. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Look, I told you, I don’t know exactly. A while. Weeks, maybe? Months? Honestly, I don't keep track of that stuff. It just…started happening. Is it really that big of a deal? I just want something to fix it. My wife…well, she always handled the doctor stuff. I'm terrible with remembering details.
DOCTOR: It can be a big deal, Mr. Kristofik. While it may be nothing, abdominal bloating can be a symptom of a number of things – from simple indigestion to something more concerning. “A while” isn’t particularly helpful, I’m afraid. Let's try to narrow it down. Besides the bloating, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little tired, but who isn't? I work hard, you know, pile driving isn't exactly a walk in the park. No pain, no…well, no nothing, really. Just the stomach. Look, is it gonna involve a lot of tests? Because I really don't have the time for all that.
DOCTOR: Pile driving is physically demanding. Fatigue can certainly be related to that, but we need to consider everything. Let's start with a basic review of your systems. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Seriously? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to. Is that what you want to know? More regular than some, less than others. It changes, alright? I eat different things, sometimes I’m more stressed at work…what kind of question is this? Is this gonna take all day?
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary question, Mr. Kristofik. Changes in bowel habits can be significant. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Of course not! Look, I’m not falling apart here. I just have a bloated stomach. You’re asking all these weird questions. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I shouldn’t have bothered coming in. My wife…she always knew what to tell the doctors. She'd explain everything, and I wouldn't have to sit here getting grilled.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand you’re frustrated, but I need information to properly assess your condition. Dismissing symptoms isn’t helpful. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I haven’t weighed myself in…a long time. Probably lost a bit, actually. Work's been tough, haven’t been eating as much. But it’s just muscle, alright? It’s from the work. I’m still strong, I can still do my job. Look, can we just skip all this and give me something for the bloating? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, with all due respect, I can’t simply prescribe medication without a proper evaluation. We've established you have bloating, fatigue, possible weight loss, and changes in bowel habits. I need to rule out more serious causes. I'm going to need to do a physical examination, and I will likely need to order some blood work. Do you consent to those procedures?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine! Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood work, poking, prodding...doesn't matter to me. Just please be quick about it. I really don't have all day. And explain everything as little as possible, alright? I get enough of that from my boss.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your abdomen first. Breathe normally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if you experience any pain or discomfort. Does this hurt anywhere?
PATIENT: No! Stop poking! It’s just…uncomfortable, alright? It’s always uncomfortable when someone’s poking around. It’s my stomach, it’s bloated. You keep asking the same questions. Are you gonna find something terrible or what? Just tell me already.
DOCTOR: I'm attempting to assess your condition, Mr. Kristofik. Your abdomen is mildly distended, and there is some tenderness upon palpation in the lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. I'm not going to speculate on "finding something terrible." That's why we are doing these assessments. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. I would also like to discuss some lifestyle modifications, but we can address that after the lab results are in. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh…no, not that I know of. My wife always handled the pills. Maybe I reacted to something once, a long time ago, but I don't remember what. Just…no, no allergies. Can we just get this over with? Where do I go for the blood work and…whatever a stool sample is?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. They will draw your blood there. The stool sample kit is in the restroom, with instructions. It is…precisely what it sounds like. You’ll need to collect a sample and bring it back to the clinic within 24 hours. I will review the results as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid heavily processed foods and carbonated beverages. And if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, ER if something bad happens. Got it. Look, thanks, I guess. Though, honestly, I'm not expecting much from all this. Just…hope it's something simple. I've got a job to do, you know? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kristofik, you may go. I will be in touch once the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. .
