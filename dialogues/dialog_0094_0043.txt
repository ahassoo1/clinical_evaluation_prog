DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It's good to meet you too. Well, I’ve been getting these headaches, right in the back of my head. Not all the time, but often enough to be a bother. Feels like…a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels a little tighter, like a band squeezing. It's been going on for, oh, I'd say about a month now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell, a month or so of headaches, primarily a dull ache in the back of the head, sometimes feeling like a band tightening. That's good information to start with. Could you tell me a little more about when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Hmm, when they happen…that’s a good question. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, really. Not like after I eat something or after being in the sun. Sometimes it's there when I wake up, which is a bit annoying. Other times it starts in the afternoon. I’ve noticed it sometimes feels worse when I’m concentrating hard, like if I'm looking over my finances for a client. But it’s not always that way. I wish I could pinpoint it, but it's just…random, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they seem to be fairly consistent in their inconsistency – happening at different times of the day, not clearly related to specific activities, and sometimes worse with concentration. That’s helpful. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate these headaches at their most intense?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good way to put it. Let me think…the worst they've been…I'd say maybe a 6, 6 or 7. They don't knock me off my feet or anything, I can still go about my day. But they're definitely noticeable and distracting. Most of the time they're more like a 3 or 4, just a constant little throb. It’s rare they get above a 6, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 6 to 7 at their worst, typically a 3 or 4. And they haven't been accompanied by any other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, vision changes, or weakness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No nausea or anything like that. My vision's been fine, as far as I can tell. I wear glasses, you know, getting older! But the prescription hasn't changed. No weakness either, my hands are steady enough to manage my clients' money, still! Just the headache. It’s a little worrying, getting older and having new things like this pop up, but I’m trying not to fuss too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Percell. It’s always good to get these things checked out. And you’re right to be proactive. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… High blood pressure, no, never been diagnosed with that. Diabetes, no. My doctor, back in…oh, it was Dr. Lee, a good man, he always said I was healthy as a horse, stubborn as one too! He passed away a few years back. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe 40 years old. Nothing serious, recovered just fine. And I broke my wrist a long time ago, playing basketball. But other than that, no major health problems. I try to eat well, mostly, and I walk every day. I'm not one to sit around.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no history of high blood pressure or diabetes, pneumonia many years ago, and a broken wrist. You consider yourself generally healthy, and maintain an active lifestyle – that’s all good to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries, Percell?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed 'em, knock on wood. I’ve been lucky that way, I suppose. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I try to avoid hospitals if I can. They always smell…funny. And doctors…well, no offense to you, of course! But I prefer to stay healthy and avoid needing to see them as much as possible.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, and a preference for staying healthy – I completely understand that, Percell. I respect that. Now, thinking about your family, are there any health problems that run in your family – things like headaches, heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm, family health…that's a tricky one. My mother, she lived to be 92, a very strong woman. She had arthritis in her knees, that was her biggest problem. My father, he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. It was a long time ago, so I don't remember the details clearly. And my older brother… he had some issues with his blood pressure, I think, but I haven't spoken to him in years. We had a falling out. As for headaches… not that I recall anyone really suffering from them like I am. My mother used to get them sometimes, but nothing like this, just a little twinge here and there. It's not something that really stands out in my memory, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Percell. History of heart trouble in your father, some blood pressure issues in your brother, and occasional headaches in your mother. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm retired now, but I keep busy. I used to be an accountant, you know, but now I do some financial advising for folks in the Hmong community. Helps them manage their money, plan for the future. It keeps my mind sharp. I walk about a mile every day, usually in the park near my house. I eat pretty well, mostly Asian cuisine, lots of vegetables. I try to avoid sugary drinks and fried foods. I don’t smoke, never have. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. And I sleep pretty well, usually about seven or eight hours a night. I live alone since my divorce, but I have a few close friends I see regularly. I'm pretty active, all things considered. Still enjoying life, you know?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full and healthy life, Percell. It’s good to hear. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, not taking anything regularly. I used to take something for my knees, a little arthritis creepin’ in, but I stopped a while back. It didn't seem to do much good, and I didn’t like the side effects. I might take some ibuprofen now and then if I’ve got a particularly bad ache, but that’s it. No vitamins, no herbal supplements, nothing like that. I try to get everything I need from my food. I'm a pretty simple man, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. No regular medications, occasional ibuprofen for aches. Thank you for that thorough information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological check. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. I figured you’d want to do some lookin' around, see what's going on under the hood. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels strange or uncomfortable, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… okay. 148 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good. Reflexes are normal, strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. No focal neurological deficits detected. No tenderness or masses detected in the head or neck. Your muscles feel a bit tense, but that could be from stress. Overall, the physical exam is fairly unremarkable, Percell. The elevated blood pressure is something we should address, and the muscle tension is worth noting. But everything else appears normal. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, my initial impression is that you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and slightly elevated blood pressure. However, to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order a few blood tests, just to be safe. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests don’t bother me none. Better to be safe than sorry, like my mother always said. Tension headaches… well, I have been a little stressed lately, with the market bein' so unpredictable. And I suppose my blood pressure isn't ideal. So, yeah, go ahead and order the tests. Whatever you think is best. When do I need to go get those done? And will you explain what you're lookin' for, so I know what’s goin' on?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Percell. I’m happy to explain everything. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. A Basic Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to check your thyroid function – sometimes thyroid issues can cause headaches. We'll also check your Vitamin D levels, as deficiency can sometimes contribute to headaches and muscle pain. The lab is just down the hall here. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Gegan ordered these tests. They’ll draw some blood, and the results should be back in a few days. I'll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend trying some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the headaches, if you're not already. Also, try to manage your stress levels – things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or spending time in nature can be helpful. Does that all make sense, Percell?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. CBC, BMP, TSH, Vitamin D… got it. And I'll try to get out in the park a little more, breathe some fresh air. I used to be pretty good at meditation, back in my younger days. Maybe I'll try to get back into that. Okay, so I just go down the hall and they’ll draw some blood. And you’ll call me when you have the results. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything I should be watchin' for in the meantime? Like, if the headaches get worse or something…
DOCTOR: That’s right, Percell. Just head down the hall to the lab. And as for what to watch for, if you experience any of the following symptoms, please contact me immediately: Severe headache that comes on suddenly and is different from your usual headaches. Headache accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, or seizures. Headache accompanied by weakness, numbness, or vision changes. Headache that gets progressively worse despite taking pain relievers. Those are signs that something more serious might be going on, and we need to rule that out. Otherwise, just continue to monitor your symptoms and try to manage your stress levels. I’ll also send you some information about tension headaches and stress management techniques, just for your reference. Do you have any other questions for me, Percell, before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for takin' the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I’ll go get those blood tests done, and I’ll wait for your call. If I think of anything else, I’ll give your office a call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day to you as well, and take care.
