DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, Mr. Shanor is me. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I want to… still can do it. It’s for the… the games. Need to be sure I’m okay.
DOCTOR: A… referee physical, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Physical. For… running and… not be slow. Important. I am… getting older, you know? Need to make sure. Not want to fall down.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. And how old are you, Mr. Shanor?
PATIENT: Thirty-one. But… feel older sometimes. Especially after running. Thirty-one. My wife… she would laugh. She always said I worried too much.
DOCTOR: Thirty-one. And what specifically are you worried about, Mr. Shanor?
PATIENT: Hmm. Heart, maybe? Sometimes… feel a little fast. And… knees. They… make noise. Not bad pain, just… noise. And… I get tired faster now. Not like before. Want to be sure it’s nothing… serious. So I can keep… doing the games.
DOCTOR: Alright. So palpitations, some knee crepitus, and decreased endurance. Have you noticed these symptoms occurring specifically during the games, or at other times as well?
PATIENT: Pal… what? Sorry. The heart thing… happens sometimes during. When I run fast. And… the knees always noise. But worse when… run a lot. Endurance… always get tired faster. Before, I could run all day. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Palpitations simply means a feeling of a rapid or irregular heartbeat. So, the rapid heartbeat occurs while you are exerting yourself during the games. And the knee crepitus—the noise—is exacerbated by activity. Has this been a gradual onset, or did it begin suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual. Slow. Not… boom, suddenly. Over… maybe a year. Wife… she noticed first. Said I was slowing down. Always teasing me. I… didn’t listen. Now… I think she was right. Everything is… slower. Not as strong.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over the past year. I see. And have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness along with these palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Sometimes… a little short of breath. But that's… just when I run really fast. Not always. Dizzy… no. Never dizzy. Just… tired. Very tired. And… knees make a lot of noise. Sometimes I worry I will fall. That is… why I am here. Don't want to fall down in front of everyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chest pain or dizziness, just shortness of breath with exertion and fatigue. And the knee crepitus is a concern, understandably. Now, have you had any previous medical evaluations for this, or any similar issues in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… don't go to doctor much. Wife… she took care of everything. After… after she gone, I don't. Just… try to ignore it. But… getting worse. That’s why I am here now. Need to be sure. For the games. And… maybe for myself too.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re here now. And I appreciate you sharing this with me. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: No… big problems. When I was little… chickenpox. And… broke arm once. Playing. But… nothing serious. No… heart trouble. No… sugar problems. Wife… always said I ate too much. But… no doctor say anything bad. Really. Nothing. Just… normal. Like everyone else. I think. Maybe.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history, just childhood chickenpox and a broken arm. And no known chronic conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Just… the arm. They… put it in cast. But… no cutting. No… big things. Wife… always said I was too tough to need surgery. She was… always joking. But… no surgery. I promise. Just… the cast. A long time ago. When I was young. Very young.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my father… he had… high blood pressure. Wife said so. She took care of the papers. And… my mother… she had… nothing. She was… very healthy. Long life. My… my sister… she is okay. No problems. I think. We… not talk much. Really. So I don’t know much. Sorry. Not good with… family things.
DOCTOR: Father with hypertension, mother healthy, limited information on sister. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. No medications. Never. Just… sometimes take something for… headache. But… not every day. Just… when it hurts. Over the counter. Nothing… special. Wife… always said I should take vitamins. But… I didn't listen. Really. No medications. Just… headache pills sometimes. When it hurts. Sorry. Not good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, only over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never. I eat… everything. Except… maybe spicy food. But… that’s just… because it burns. Not… allergy. Really. No allergies. Wife… always said I had iron stomach. She was… always joking. But… no allergies. I promise. Not good with… remembering things. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And finally, could you briefly describe your social history?
PATIENT: Social… I… work. I fix things. For… factories. Refractory materials. It’s… hard work. I… live alone now. Wife… she gone. Two years ago. I… don’t… do much else. Not much friends. Just… work. And… try to keep busy. Try to still do the games. Referee. Important. That's… my social. Sorry. Not… exciting. Really. Very boring.
DOCTOR: I understand. You work as a refractory materials technician, live alone since your wife passed two years ago, and referee games. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Mr. Shanor, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Exam is… good. I want to be sure. If… if it’s okay. Exam is… good. I need to know. For the games. And… for myself too. Yes. Please. Exam is… good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not critically so. Pulse is 78 and regular. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Temperature, pulse, and respiration are within normal limits. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. We’ll need to investigate that further. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Palpation of the abdomen is normal. Now, I’d like to take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Knees… bend. Like this? It… makes noise. You hear it? Like… clicking. And… little bit stiff. Not bad pain. Just… noise. And… little bit hard to bend all the way. Wife… always said I was getting old. She was… right. Please… check carefully. I want to know what is wrong. If something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear crepitus – that clicking sound – with flexion and extension. There’s some tenderness along the medial joint line, and your range of motion is slightly limited. There's no significant swelling or instability. I detect crepitus, tenderness, and mild limitation of range of motion in both knees. This is consistent with osteoarthritis, but we'll need imaging to confirm the extent of the damage. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Reflexes are normal. Alright, Mr. Shanor. Based on my initial examination, you have some concerning findings, including a heart murmur and osteoarthritis in your knees. I recommend further investigation to determine the underlying cause of the murmur and to assess the severity of your osteoarthritis. I’d like to order an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart rhythm and a set of knee X-rays. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. ECG… and… X-rays. If… if it will help. I want to know. Heart… murmur? Is bad? And… osteoarthritis? Is that… serious? Can I… still do the games? I… need to know. If I can still… referee. It’s… important. Please… tell me everything. And… can I still work? If my knees are bad… can I still fix things? Really. Tell me everything. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. Let's address your concerns one by one. A heart murmur doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It simply indicates an abnormal sound during your heartbeat. An ECG will help us determine if the murmur is associated with any underlying heart rhythm abnormalities or structural problems. We’ll need to review the results to determine the best course of action. As for osteoarthritis, it's a degenerative joint condition, meaning the cartilage in your knees is wearing down. It's a common condition, especially as we age. It can cause pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, as you've experienced. The severity can vary significantly. Whether you can continue to referee games and work depends on the severity of your osteoarthritis and the findings of the ECG. I wouldn't want you to risk further injury. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss options like physical therapy, pain management, and potential modifications to your activities. I'm going to order the ECG and knee X-rays today. I'll also give you a referral to a cardiologist for a comprehensive evaluation of your heart. I want to rule out any serious underlying conditions. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities that exacerbate your knee pain or cause palpitations. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Cardio… what? And… what is… exacerbate? Sorry. I don't… understand everything. No… strenuous… what? If… if I can't do the games… what will happen? It’s… important to me. And… can I still work? If my knees… are bad. I… need to fix things. I… need the job. What… will happen? Please… tell me everything. And… can my knees… get better? If… if I do… physical what? Please. I’m… worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor, let’s break this down. A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in heart conditions. I’m referring you to one to get a more detailed assessment of your heart murmur. "Exacerbate" means to make something worse. So, I’m advising you to avoid any activities that make your knee pain or heart palpitations worse. “Strenuous” activities would be things like running, jumping, or heavy lifting. Regarding your concerns about your ability to continue refereeing and working, it’s too early to say definitively. We need the results of the tests to determine the extent of your conditions. If the osteoarthritis is mild, physical therapy and pain management may be sufficient to allow you to continue your activities with some modifications. If it’s more severe, we may need to explore other options. As for your heart, the cardiologist will determine if the murmur is benign or requires further intervention. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knees, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. It may not completely “cure” the osteoarthritis, but it can significantly improve your quality of life. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that I will do everything I can to help you maintain your quality of life. We’ll take it one step at a time, starting with the tests. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: One step at a time… okay. Tests… okay. And… how long for tests? And… will it cost… a lot of money? I… don't have… much money. Wife… gone. Everything… expensive. And… can I still… drive? If my knees… are bad. I… need to drive. To work. Please… tell me everything. Really. Everything. I’m… very worried. And… thank you. For… everything. You… are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Shanor. I understand your concerns about the cost and the impact on your daily life. The ECG is a quick and painless test that we can perform here in the office today. The results should be available within a few hours. The knee X-rays can also be scheduled today at the imaging center across the street. The results typically take 24-48 hours to be sent to my office. Regarding the cost, I will have my billing department contact you to discuss your insurance coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. I don’t have the exact figures readily available, but they will provide you with a detailed breakdown. As for driving, it depends on the severity of your knee condition. If you have significant pain or limited range of motion, it may be difficult to operate the pedals safely. I will assess your range of motion during your next appointment and provide you with specific recommendations. For now, I advise you to drive cautiously and avoid any unnecessary risks. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the test results and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend resting your knees, avoiding strenuous activities, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude this appointment?
PATIENT: One week… okay. Rest… okay. And… over-the-counter… okay. No… I think… that’s all. Thank you… very much. You… are very kind. You… help me. Really. Thank you. And… thank you for… not laughing. At… my questions. I… don't understand… much. But… you… help me. Thank you. I… will see you… next week. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Shanor. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And don't worry about asking questions – it's my job to help you understand everything. Have a good week, and I’ll see you next week. Goodbye.
