DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, I’m tired. Really tired. And it’s… well, it’s embarrassing. I keep wanting to eat dirt. Like, actual earth. Don’t look at me like that. It’s… a craving. A bad one. And it’s getting worse. I just want to know what’s wrong with me so I can get this over with.
DOCTOR: Dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt. Clay. Whatever you call it. It sounds crazy, I know. But I can’t… I just feel like I need it sometimes. It started small, just a little taste here and there. Now… now I find myself looking for it. It’s stupid, right? I don’t know why I’m telling you this. Just… fix it.
DOCTOR: It is… unusual. And while I appreciate your candor, Ms. Cantoran, simply stating you "feel like you need it" isn't particularly helpful for a diagnosis. We need specifics. When did this begin exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics? Honestly, I don't remember exactly. A few months ago, maybe? Look, I’m a programmer, I deal with code, not… when I started eating the garden. It all kinda blends together. I was stressed, work was busy, and then… well, I just started. Is that good enough? I really don’t have time for a detailed timeline, doc.
DOCTOR: “A few months ago” isn’t a medical assessment, Ms. Cantoran. But alright. And this stress… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What is this, a therapy session? It's work, okay? Long hours, demanding projects, always behind schedule. My husband… he used to help me with things, keep me organized. But he’s gone now, so… everything's just harder. Everything piles up. It's just… stress. A lot of it. Does it really matter why I'm stressed if I'm eating dirt? Just find out what’s wrong and give me something to stop it.
DOCTOR: It matters because symptoms don’t exist in a vacuum, Ms. Cantoran. Now, besides this… unusual craving, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I’m tired, obviously. More tired than usual. And… I don't know… maybe a little stomach trouble. But who doesn't have stomach trouble? I eat weird things, what do you expect? Honestly, I'm starting to get a headache. Is this going to take long? I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: Stomach trouble… is it nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea? Sometimes, I guess. Not all the time. Mostly just… feeling off. Like something's not right. And… my stomach hurts sometimes. Not like a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Look, I’m not a doctor, doc. I don’t know fancy words. Is this dirt thing serious? Because if it is, I need to know. I don’t have time for a long illness.
DOCTOR: It could indicate a deficiency. We'll need to run some tests. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Look, are you asking me if I’m pooping differently? Really? This is ridiculous. I don’t know! I go to the bathroom when I need to, like everyone else. I haven’t been paying attention to… the specifics of it. Can we just skip this part? I’m starting to feel really uncomfortable. And, frankly, a little insulted.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you experienced any unusual cravings other than dirt?
PATIENT: Other cravings? No. Just… the dirt. It’s not like I suddenly want pickles and ice cream, okay? It’s just… this. I told you, it's embarrassing. I don't know why this is happening! Just… are you going to do something or just keep asking me questions? I really need to get back to work. I have a deadline, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Let's do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse… just to rule out anything obvious. And then we'll get the lab orders sorted. Don't expect miracles; some deficiencies take time to correct. Now, please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Let's just get it over with. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of my time. Just… hurry up. And try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Lungs clear. Soft, non-tender. No masses. No obvious abnormalities, Ms. Cantoran. But we still need to rule out iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning. I'll order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a lead level. It’s a standard procedure, given your… unusual dietary habits.
PATIENT: Lead poisoning? Are you saying I’m poisoned? From dirt? Look, I get it’s weird, okay? But I’m not… sick. I’m just tired and I crave earth. That’s all. So… how long until I get the results? And… will I need more poking and prodding? I really, really don’t want more poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: The lab results will take approximately 48-72 hours, Ms. Cantoran. And yes, further testing may be required depending on the initial findings. But let's not jump to conclusions. For now, I'm going to recommend you try to increase your iron intake through diet. Lean meats, leafy green vegetables… and avoid eating dirt, naturally. It is, frankly, detrimental to your health. Now, here is the lab order form. Please take it to the front desk. And try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Fine. Rest. Avoid dirt. Like it's that easy. Look, I’m going to go. Don’t bother calling me unless it’s something important. I have work to do. Just what a waste of time. .
