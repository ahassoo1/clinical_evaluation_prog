DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, can we just get this over with? I don’t have all day. It’s… tiredness. Really bad tiredness. And… I eat dirt. Not like a hobby, you know? It just… happens. I don't even remember when it started, honestly. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling quite tired, and you’ve also noticed you’ve been… ingesting dirt. It's alright, we’ll take our time and figure things out. "Probably nothing" is good to rule out, but it’s important to investigate both of these symptoms. Let’s start with the tiredness. Could you describe what you mean by "really bad tiredness"?
PATIENT: Describe? It’s… like being weighted down. Like someone put a bunch of rocks in my shoes and then told me to run a marathon. I just… don’t have energy. It’s not like I’m just a little sleepy. I can barely get through the day. I used to be able to work, you know? CNC programming... takes focus. Now? Forget it. I’m useless. And it’s been… a while. Months, maybe? I lose track.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a significant and persistent fatigue that’s interfering with your daily activities, specifically your ability to work. You’ve noticed it for months now, impacting your concentration and focus. That certainly sounds concerning, Ms. Cantoran. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? What am I supposed to say? I… I guess I've been a little short-tempered lately. My neighbor, old man Henderson, keeps complaining about my… stuff. Honestly, he’s just a busybody. And I’ve been… I dunno… kinda cold all the time, even when it’s hot. Though, I haven't really thought about it much, if that makes sense. It just is. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you. Short temper and feeling cold even when it’s warm are definitely things we should explore. It sounds like you're experiencing some irritability and potentially some temperature regulation issues. Let's shift gears for a moment, and talk about this dirt ingestion. You mentioned it just… happens. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s embarrassing, okay? Don’t make me relive it. It’s… mostly in the mornings. When I’m making coffee. I go outside to… get some stuff. From the garden. It’s… red clay. Soft. I don’t think about it, honestly. My hand just… reaches for it. Then I… eat a little. Sometimes more than a little. I don’t know why! And it doesn't even taste good, you know? It just… feels right, for a minute. Then I feel stupid. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Cantoran. You’re describing a craving for red clay, particularly in the mornings while making coffee, and it doesn't seem to be driven by taste. It’s important you feel comfortable sharing these details with me, and I appreciate your honesty. This craving for clay is something we'll need to investigate further. It's called pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Now, let’s go through some general medical history questions. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical problems? Ugh. My husband… he had a heart attack, years ago. That was… awful. I took care of him for a long time. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Other than that… nothing much. I'm pretty tough. I don’t really go to the doctor. Waste of time, honestly. And I definitely don't have insurance. Can we just skip this part?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Cantoran, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been through a lot with your husband’s heart attack and your own appendectomy. I want to assure you I'll be mindful of your time. It's helpful to have a general sense, though. Did your husband’s heart attack have any lasting effects on you – for example, did you experience any significant stress or changes to your lifestyle as a result?
PATIENT: Stress? Look, it ruined my life, okay? I had a career, I liked my job. Then I had to take care of him. For years. It was… exhausting. And lonely. He wasn't a pleasant man, to be honest. He complained a lot. So yeah, a lot of stress. And then when he finally… passed… everything just felt… empty. I tried to go back to work, but I couldn't focus. Too much… everything. Honestly, I’m a mess. Can we please just get to the point? What’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your frustration and I apologize for going over things that are difficult to revisit. You’ve clearly experienced a great deal of loss and stress, and it's understandable that it has had a significant impact on your life. It takes courage to share these things, and I appreciate you being open with me. Given the fatigue, the pica, the irritability, and your history of significant stress, I want to consider several possibilities. One important thing to rule out is iron deficiency anemia, as pica can sometimes be a symptom. We also need to consider potential thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and the possibility of depression. I'd like to start with a physical exam and some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Seriously? Look, I told you, I don't have insurance. I can't afford… whatever that costs. And honestly, I don’t like needles. Can’t we just… try something else? Like… I don't know… a vitamin? Maybe I just need a good vitamin?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and your aversion to needles, Ms. Cantoran. You are right to ask about other options. A vitamin might be helpful, but without knowing what's going on internally, we could be masking a more serious underlying problem. I’m mindful of your financial situation. While a full panel of blood tests would be ideal, we can prioritize a few key tests to start, specifically a complete blood count and an iron panel. These will give us a good initial look at your red blood cell count and iron levels, which are relevant to both the fatigue and the pica. I also want to be transparent about the cost. I will ask the lab to provide you with the self-pay price, and we can discuss options if it's still unaffordable. Before we proceed with anything, I need your permission to conduct a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It's a standard procedure to gather more information. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But no needles, okay? And I’m warning you, don’t try to sell me anything. I’m not made of money. And if it’s going to take all day, just forget it. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cantoran. No needles today, and I assure you, I am not here to sell you anything. I understand your time is valuable, and I will be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That's within normal limits, but slightly elevated blood pressure is worth noting. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Finally, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or masses detected. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. It just… feels like a stomach. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I don't know what it's supposed to feel like. Just tell me what's wrong with me already. This is taking forever. And frankly, it’s depressing. Everything just… feels awful. I'm tired, I'm hungry for dirt, and I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. It is taking time, and I apologize for that. It's never my intention to make you feel worse. Based on the physical exam and your history, I can’t give you a definitive diagnosis right now. However, several possibilities come to mind. The fatigue, the pica , and your history of stress are concerning. Given your reluctance about blood tests, we can start with a trial of iron supplements and a multivitamin. However, I strongly recommend we get those blood tests to rule out other causes, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. We also need to consider the possibility of depression, given your history of loss and stress. I'm going to write you a prescription for a daily iron supplement and a multivitamin. I’ll also provide you with some information about depression and resources for support. Would you be open to discussing the possibility of a referral to a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: Therapist? Are you kidding me? Look, I don't need someone to talk about my problems. I have problems. I need them fixed, not analyzed. Just… give me the pills. And tell me how much they cost. And then I want to go home. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of my time. And it's making me feel even worse.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. I respect your decision. I will write you a prescription for an iron supplement and a multivitamin. The cost should be around $20-$30, depending on the pharmacy. I’ve also printed out some information on iron deficiency anemia, potential side effects of the supplements, and resources for managing stress. Please read through that carefully. I still strongly recommend blood tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms. If your symptoms don't improve within a month of starting the supplements, or if they worsen, please schedule another appointment so we can re-evaluate. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just... pills. And I'm leaving. This has been awful. Stop wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. Here is your prescription and the informational materials. I wish you all the best. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Remember, taking care of your health is important. .
PATIENT: .
