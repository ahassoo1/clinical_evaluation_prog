DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor...Rosanova, was it? Yes. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like all I do is go, go, go. It’s a nuisance, really. Not what a man my age needs.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be a nuisance. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. Well, it’s just… more. More often than it used to be, naturally. I’m not a young sprout anymore, you know. Used to be able to go a good while between trips. Now… not so much. At night, too. Waking me up. My wife doesn’t like that. It’s not painful, mind you. Just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Alright, not painful, that’s good to know. And it’s definitely increased over time. When you say "a good while," roughly how often were you going before, and how often are you going now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking me to remember… Dates and numbers were never my strong suit. Before… before, I suppose… maybe six, seven hours between times? Something like that. Now? Seems like every couple of hours, even if I haven’t had much to drink. Maybe three, four times a night. It’s a bother, I tell ya. A real bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's quite a difference. So, going from roughly six to seven hours awake, to every couple of hours, and three to four times a night. Have you noticed any other changes along with this?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me see. Not that I recall. No… wait. Sometimes I feel like I don’t quite empty the bladder all the way. Like there’s a little left in there. But it’s not much. And no… no fever, no pain, just… this constant need to go. I've been drinking the same amount of fluids, mind you. Always have. Water, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, incomplete emptying is good to know. And you haven't changed your fluid intake, which is helpful. Do you have any difficulty starting the stream of urine when you go, or is the stream weak or forceful?
PATIENT: Difficulty… Hmm. No, not really difficulty starting. It comes alright. It's not like a strong push or anything, not like when I was a young man. Just… regular. A normal stream, I suppose. Not weak, not powerful. Middle of the road. Always been that way, to be honest. Never been one for strong anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a normal, steady stream, not weak or forceful, and no trouble initiating it. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now what does that have to do with going to the bathroom? I go when I need to, same as always. Sometimes a little constipated, if I’m being honest. But that's just old age. Happens to everyone. Never paid much mind to it, really. Why are you asking about… that?
DOCTOR: It can sometimes give us clues, Mr. Segretto. Constipation can put pressure on the bladder, and that can sometimes contribute to urinary frequency. Let’s move on, though. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no! No blood. That would be alarming, wouldn't it? And no pain, Doctor. No pain in my back, no pain in my side. Like I said, it’s just… the going. Constant going. I'm a farmer, you know. I need my rest. This is cutting into my nap time.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear there's no blood or pain. Farming is hard work – getting enough rest is important. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes…no, never. High blood pressure…the doctor mentioned it once, years ago. Put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t seem to be doing much, and I don’t like taking pills. Heart problems…well, I get a little short of breath sometimes when I'm doing heavy work, but that’s just from the exertion. I'm an old man, Doctor. What do you expect?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of mild high blood pressure, and some shortness of breath with exertion. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was…a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a tractor. Other than that, no. Never been one for hospitals. Don't like 'em. Smells like sickness and worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy as a child, broken arm. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… this little cream for my arthritis. My wife gets it for me. Rub it on my knees. Doesn’t do much, really. And sometimes I take a little something for indigestion. But that's only when I eat something rich. Nothing regular, mind you. Just the cream. Old age, you see. Joints get creaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the arthritis cream and occasional indigestion medication. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... Oh, my. My father lived to be 85, strong as an ox. Mother, she passed away when I was young. Had some sort of sickness, can’t recall what. My brother, he had a weak heart, passed away young too. Rest of the family… mostly healthy folk, I reckon. Farmers, all of ‘em.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your father lived a long life, your mother passed away young from an unknown illness, and your brother had heart problems. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything. Been eating everything my whole life. My wife always worries about that, but I've never had a reaction. Dust bothers my nose sometimes, but that's just from being on the farm.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Segretto, I think I have enough information for now. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll need to examine your abdomen, and do a quick check of your prostate. That's to help rule out any other potential causes for your frequent urination. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: A… prostate check? Now hold on just a minute. Is that absolutely necessary, Doctor? I’ve heard stories… it’s a bit…invasive, isn’t it? I'm an old man, but… well, I’d rather not, if you don’t mind. Maybe we can skip that part?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It can be a bit uncomfortable, and many men feel the same way. However, it's a very important part of evaluating frequent urination in men your age, as an enlarged prostate is a common cause. It's a quick exam, and it can help us determine if further testing is needed. I'll be as gentle and efficient as possible. We can discuss the results and options if anything is detected. If you’re still uncomfortable, we can proceed without it, but it might mean we need to consider further tests like a urine analysis or even a referral to a specialist. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Urine analysis… a specialist… goodness. It sounds like a lot of bother. Alright, alright. Go ahead and do your… check. But be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle, like you said. I’m trusting you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. I appreciate your trust. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie back on the exam table. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight wheeze. That's not uncommon with age, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I need to listen to your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No…no tenderness. It feels… normal, I suppose. Like a regular belly. Just a little…soft, maybe. I haven't been eating as well lately, my wife complains. Be careful now, Doctor, you're poking around in there. It's not like I'm made of stone.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I was too firm, Mr. Segretto. Your abdomen is soft, as you said. Now, to complete the exam, I'm going to perform a digital rectal exam. I'll explain as I go. Please just relax as much as possible. Okay… I feel your prostate gland. It is slightly enlarged, but smooth. There's no tenderness or hard lumps. Alright. That's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? I knew it. I just knew it. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it…serious? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: It's common for the prostate to enlarge with age, Mr. Segretto. It’s called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. It doesn't mean you have cancer. It simply means your prostate is larger than normal, and that can press on your urethra – the tube that carries urine from your bladder – causing the frequent urination you're experiencing. Most men experience this as they get older. We can manage it with medication or lifestyle changes. Surgery is rarely the first option, and we would only consider that if other methods aren’t effective. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a urine analysis to check for infection and other issues, and a PSA blood test, which can give us a better idea of your prostate health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Medication… more pills? I don't like the sound of that. But…surgery even less. Alright, alright. Do your tests. Urine analysis and… the blood test. Just…don't tell me I need anything drastic. I'm an old man, Doctor. I just want to be able to sleep through the night. And maybe enjoy a cup of coffee without having to run to the bathroom every five minutes.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. My goal is to help you sleep through the night and enjoy your coffee. We'll start with these tests, and then we can discuss the best course of action based on the results. I’ll write you a lab order now. You can get these tests done at the lab across the street. They take walk-ins. Once you have the results, you can either have them sent directly to my office, or bring them with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Across the street, you say? Good. That’s convenient. Alright, I’ll get those done. Send them straight to your office, I suppose. Less for me to keep track of. And… how long will it be until I hear back? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. My office will call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to limit your caffeine intake and avoid drinking fluids right before bed. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Limit my coffee… That’s a tall order, Doctor. A very tall order. But… I suppose I can try. No… no, I don't think so. That’s all for now. Just…get back to me quickly, alright? I'm an old man. Time is of the essence.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. We'll get back to you as quickly as possible. Here's a copy of the lab order for your records. It was nice meeting you. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
