DOCTOR: Right. Mirriam Sucich, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Mirriam Sucich. Though everyone just calls me Mirriam, if that's alright. It's a bit formal, all the full name business! It's nice to meet you, Doctor… Nooruddin, is it?
DOCTOR: Nooruddin is fine. Though, frankly, I have patients to see, so let's try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, of course. Sorry, dear. I just like to be polite. Efficient is good, efficient is very good. I came in about these hiccups… they've been going on for… oh, let me think… a good few days now. Not constantly, but they just keep coming back. It’s a bit unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: Hiccups. Right. And how long precisely is “a few days”?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… It started sometime last week, I think. Tuesday, maybe? No, Wednesday. Definitely Wednesday. It was when old Mr. Henderson was telling that very long story about his prize-winning mangoes. I remember because I was trying so hard not to laugh, and then… hic… there they started! And they’ve been popping up ever since, on and off. Not all the time, mind you, but enough to be a nuisance.
DOCTOR: So, intermittent hiccups for… approximately a week. Any other symptoms accompanying these… episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, really. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no dizziness… just… hic… these hiccups! It's just… annoying, you know? And a bit embarrassing, especially when I'm at work. I’m a psychiatric aide, and it’s not very calming for the patients when I'm suddenly hic… hiccuping away!
DOCTOR: And you've had no changes to your medications recently?
PATIENT: No, no changes at all to my medication. I’ve been on the same things for years, and they’re working just fine. Doctor Patel keeps a very close eye on everything, she’s wonderful. It’s definitely not anything to do with that, I can assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of… let’s say, acid reflux or indigestion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A little bit, years ago. When I was younger, I used to get heartburn quite a lot, especially if I had spicy food. But that was ages ago! It hasn’t bothered me for… well, decades, really. I changed my diet and it just went away. I haven’t had any trouble with it since. Though, I did have a particularly lovely curry last week… could that be it? But I didn’t feel any heartburn, just these… hic… hiccups.
DOCTOR: And your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, my social history? What would you like to know? I live alone since the divorce, lovely little bungalow just outside of town. I keep busy, mostly. I work, of course, and I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week. I used to love gardening, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I don't drink much, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I certainly don't smoke. I try to stay active, you know? It’s important. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s have a listen to your lungs, just to be thorough. And I’d like to check your reflexes. If you could just sit up there for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I used to be quite the athlete, you know. Volleyball mostly. But that was a long, long time ago! Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Reflexes are… normal, albeit a little diminished. Not unexpected for your age. Honestly, it sounds like… benign hiccups. Sometimes they just happen. Have you tried holding your breath?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Holding my breath? Yes, dear, I’ve tried everything. Old wives’ tales, you know? Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, getting startled… even a spoonful of sugar! Nothing seems to work. That’s why I came to see you, Doctor. I thought maybe there was something… I don't know… something more to it? It’s just been going on for so long now.
DOCTOR: Well, given your age and the lack of any other concerning symptoms, and you've already tried the usual remedies... I suppose we could try a medication. But it's really a last resort. Baclofen is sometimes prescribed, but it has side effects. Are you sure you want to go down that road?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A medication… I don’t like the sound of side effects, dear. Not at all. I'm not one for taking pills unless I absolutely have to. Is it something serious, Doctor? Is there something I should be worried about? Maybe… maybe it will just go away on its own? I’m really trying to avoid anything strong if I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Sucich, you're 86 years old. Intermittent hiccups are rarely a sign of anything serious. It's likely just a temporary irritation. I really don’t want to put you on medication unnecessarily. I recommend you continue to monitor it. If it gets significantly worse, or you develop other symptoms—shortness of breath, chest pain, anything like that—then call the office immediately. Otherwise… try to relax and don’t worry about it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. No, I don’t think that’s all, Doctor. Though, thank you for your time. It’s good to know it's probably nothing serious. And I will, of course, call if anything changes. It’s just… annoying, really. But if it's nothing to worry about, then I suppose I can live with it. Thank you again, Doctor Nooruddin. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, you’re welcome. Try not to stress about it. Have a good day, Mrs. Sucich.
