DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here today to get a check-up, you see. I am hoping to move into one of those… senior living places. They want a doctor to say I am alright before they let me in, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-admission physical, understood. And you said you’re hoping to move into a senior living facility?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. I live alone, you see, and it is getting… difficult. Not dangerous, just… more effort than it used to be. I bake a lot, and that keeps me busy, but even that is becoming a bit much sometimes. A place with others around, and maybe some help with things... it seems like a good idea. Do you need me to tell you which facility it is?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Tkac. No, not yet, we can get to that later if needed. Let’s start with a general overview of your health. Have you been feeling generally well, aside from the increasing effort with daily tasks?
PATIENT: Yes, generally well. I do tire easier, as I mentioned. And my knees… well, they ache sometimes, especially when the weather changes. But no serious illnesses, no hospital stays recently. I have a good appetite, thankfully. I still enjoy my baking, and a good cup of coffee in the mornings. I sleep alright, most nights. Is that the sort of thing you are wanting to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. So, tiredness, knee pain, otherwise good appetite and sleep. Let's delve a little deeper into that knee pain. Can you describe where exactly it hurts, and what makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: It's mostly in the front of both knees, Doctor. Not sharp pain, more of a dull ache. Walking a lot makes it worse, naturally. And like I said, when the weather turns cold or damp, it really bothers me. Resting helps, and sometimes I put a warm cloth on them. A hot water bottle, you know. It doesn’t cure it, but it takes the edge off. It hasn’t gotten suddenly worse, it's just… been a gradual thing over the last few years. I still manage, but I have to pace myself. Do you want me to show you how it feels when I stand up?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you wouldn’t mind. That would be helpful. And no need to rush, take your time.
PATIENT: There. It’s not terrible right now, but you can see it takes a little effort. And when I first put my weight on them, there’s a bit of a… creaking sound. Not loud, but I can feel it. And then the ache starts. It's better after I've been walking a bit, surprisingly. The stiffness goes away after a while. It’s just… an old man thing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. And that creaking sound… is it accompanied by any locking or giving way of the knees?
PATIENT: No, no locking or giving way, Doctor. They feel solid enough. It’s just the noise. Like old hinges, perhaps. I've never actually fallen because of my knees, thankfully. I just have to be careful on stairs, and I avoid rough ground when I can. And I listen to my body, you know? If it says “slow down,” I slow down. I’ve learned to be patient with myself over the years. It wasn’t always easy, but… here I am, still baking.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Tkac. Very sensible. Alright, let's move on to a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me about that a few years back. I take a little pill every day for it. Keeps it under control, thankfully. And I had a touch of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered fully. Nothing else that I can recall. No diabetes, no heart problems. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, all things considered. Do you need the name of the doctor who diagnosed my blood pressure? I remember it quite clearly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Yes, if you don’t mind providing the doctor’s name, that would be helpful for our records. And what is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. The doctor's name is Dr. Emily Carter. She used to practice over in Rapid City, but I believe she moved away. As for the medication… let me see… it’s a small white pill. The bottle says… Lisinopril. That’s it. Lisinopril. I take one every morning with my coffee. It seems to do the trick. I haven’t had any trouble with it. I am quite good with remembering details, you see. My wife used to say I remembered everything except where I put my keys.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril, and Dr. Carter. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the Lisinopril. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a few years back. Didn’t seem to make much difference, so I figured I’d save my money. I get most of my vitamins from my food, you see. And I drink plenty of water. I don't hold with taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. A good cup of coffee is more important, I think. Do you approve of coffee, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I certainly do, Mr. Tkac. A good cup of coffee is a fine thing indeed. Alright, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I am aware of, anyway. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I've never had a reaction. I've never had trouble with bee stings or poison ivy, either. My wife used to worry about me trying new foods, but I always said “a little bit of everything never hurt anyone.” She was a good woman. Always looking out for me. But no allergies, Doctor. I can safely say that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Tkac. And it sounds like you had a wonderful wife. Alright, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Let me see… My mother lived to be 92, and she was as healthy as a horse until the very end. My father died younger, from a heart attack, I believe. And my sister, she had some trouble with her eyesight as she got older. But nothing else that I can recall. No dementia in the family, thankfully. And no cancer, as far as I know. We weren’t a particularly close family, so I don’t know a lot about their medical histories. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? The detailed family history? I can try to remember more if you like.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Tkac. Knowing about your father’s heart attack is useful. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife couldn't stand the smell of it, so I never started. And I don't drink alcohol, either. Never really had the taste for it. And recreational drugs? Heavens no. I always considered that a waste of time and money. I prefer a good book, or a quiet evening baking. That's my idea of a good time. And a strong cup of coffee, of course. Is that acceptable, Doctor? A quiet life?
DOCTOR: Perfectly acceptable, Mr. Tkac. A very sensible lifestyle. Alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything specific you are concerned about, or anything else you would like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I think I’ve told you everything. Just hoping to be cleared for that senior living place, you see. It’s getting a bit lonely living on my own, and I think it would be good to be around other people. I am not worried about the exam, I just want to make sure everything is alright. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man ramble on. Are you ready to proceed when you are?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tkac. It’s my pleasure. And you haven't been rambling at all. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I am ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I've had a few aches and pains over the years, so I am used to being poked and prodded. It's all part of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Please extend your arm. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at those knees. Could you please sit on the edge of the bed and let me examine them?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Right here. Go ahead. They are a bit stiff this morning, you know. The weather has been damp. Here they are. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I am not a medical man, so I may not understand all the things you are looking for.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. There's some mild crepitus with range of motion, as you mentioned. No significant swelling or redness. Palpation reveals mild tenderness along the joint line. Range of motion is slightly limited, but generally good. No signs of instability. It appears to be typical osteoarthritis, commonly seen with age. Reflexes are normal and neurological function appears intact.
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis, you say? That sounds about right. My wife used to say I was getting old and creaky like an old door. I suppose she was right. Is it something to worry about, Doctor? Will I be needing any special treatment? I’d rather not take a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. And I still want to be able to bake, you see. That's very important to me.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tkac, it’s not something to worry about unduly. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, and it’s manageable. We can focus on conservative treatment options to help alleviate your symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Things like gentle exercise – walking, swimming, perhaps some light stretching – to keep the joints mobile. Weight management, if needed, to reduce stress on the knees. And over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for pain. We can also discuss physical therapy if you feel it would be beneficial. And yes, you should absolutely still be able to bake. We want to keep you doing the things you enjoy. Do you have any questions about those options?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Gentle exercise, I can manage that. I enjoy walking, and the swimming pool at the senior living place sounds nice. Weight management… well, I do enjoy my baking, but I suppose I can cut back a little. And over-the-counter pain relievers, that's not so bad. I’d rather not take anything stronger, if I can avoid it. Physical therapy… I’ll have to think about that. So, does that mean I am cleared for that senior living place, Doctor? Is that what I’ve been waiting for? That’s the most important thing, you see. To have a safe place to live and maybe make some new friends.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tkac, based on my examination and your medical history, I believe you are medically cleared to move into the senior living facility. You appear to be in generally good health, and your osteoarthritis is manageable with conservative treatment options. I will send a report to the facility confirming your clearance. Now, I recommend you follow up with your primary care physician in a few months for a routine check-up and to discuss any concerns you may have. Do you have the name and contact information for your primary care physician?
PATIENT: Oh, that is wonderful news, Doctor! That is exactly what I was hoping to hear. Thank you so much. My primary care physician… let me see… her name is Dr. Sarah Johnson. She is over at the Rapid City Medical Center. I have her number right here. Here you go. And thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man’s concerns. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go bake a cake. To celebrate!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I’m glad I could help. And that sounds like a wonderful idea – a celebratory cake is always a good thing. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best at the senior living facility. I'll have my nurse print out a summary of today’s visit and instructions for you before you leave. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and understanding. I will see you again if needed. Goodbye!
