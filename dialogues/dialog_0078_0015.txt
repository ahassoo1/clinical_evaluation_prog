DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. Um... my nose... it been... not good. Like... stuffy. And... a little pain, sometimes. I forget what the doctor say before, but... it's my sinus, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing nasal congestion and some pain in your sinuses. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm... when it start? That is... hard to remember. Maybe... a week ago? Or more? It come slowly, I think. Not all at once. I been working a lot, maybe that is why I not remember good. It just... felt worse each day.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's easy to lose track when you're busy. So, it started gradually about a week ago, and has been progressively worsening. Do you recall anything that might have triggered it – like a cold, allergies, or being around someone who was sick?
PATIENT: A cold... maybe. My husband, he had a little cough, a few weeks back. Not bad, just a small cough. I not get sick, I thought. But... maybe it come from that? I not sure. We been working outside a lot, with the drilling… lots of dust. Maybe the dust? I really do not know, Doctor. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Mikeisha. Being around your husband’s cough and the dust from the drilling are both possible factors. Do you feel like the congestion and pain are constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: It... mostly constant. But some days it worse than others. Like, when it is very hot, or when I bend over... it feel more pressure. And... at night, when I lay down... it hard to breathe. The stuffiness... it bad. Does that make sense, Doctor? I try to explain good.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, constant congestion with increased pressure when it's hot or when you bend over, and difficulty breathing when lying down. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this – such as a fever, headache, facial tenderness, or a change in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: A fever... no, I do not think so. I feel warm sometimes, but not sick warm. Headache... maybe a little, but I get headaches anyway. Sometimes from work, sometimes just... because. Facial tenderness... hmm... maybe a little on my cheekbones. But I can't be sure. And... no, my smell and taste is okay. I can still smell my husband's cooking!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, so no fever, headaches are usual for you, some tenderness around your cheekbones, and your smell and taste are normal. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, or chronic sinus infections?
PATIENT: Allergies... no, I don't think so. My mother, she had allergies, to flowers, I think. But me, no. Asthma... no. I can run very good when I was young! And... chronic sinus infections... I don't know. I get sick sometimes, like everyone, but I not go to the doctor much. Just take some pills and rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of allergies or asthma, and you haven't been diagnosed with chronic sinus infections. Have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries... hmm. When I was little, I had my tonsils out. That is all I remember. And… no serious illnesses. I been very healthy, mostly. I work very hard, you know? I not have time to be sick. My husband always say I need to rest more.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. Just the tonsillectomy in the past. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I not take nothing. I try to stay away from pills, if I can. Sometimes, when I have a headache, I take… what you call it… ibuprofen? But not often. Just when it is very bad. And no vitamins, no herbal supplements. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never had a bad reaction to any pills. My mother always say I have a strong stomach. But I not take many, so maybe that is why! I don’t think I have any allergies to medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Mikeisha. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses for tenderness, and look inside your nose to see what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please. My nose… it feel a little sore.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths in and out for me, please. Okay, your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your sinuses to check for any tenderness. And finally, I’m going to take a look inside your nose. Okay, I see some swelling and redness inside your nasal passages, and some mucus buildup. It looks like you have some inflammation of your sinuses. It’s consistent with sinusitis, likely triggered by a viral infection, possibly complicated by some irritation from the dust. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen, I believe you have acute sinusitis.
PATIENT: Acute... what? Sinusitis? Is that bad, Doctor? Is it from the dust, or the cold? My husband, he say I need to be more careful. Is it going to go away? I just want to feel better, you know? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable you’re concerned, Mikeisha. Acute sinusitis simply means inflammation of your sinuses, and it’s very common. It sounds like it likely started with a viral infection—perhaps from your husband’s cold—and was then aggravated by the dust at work. It’s not usually serious, but it can be quite uncomfortable. Most cases will improve on their own within 7 to 10 days with supportive care. We'll focus on relieving your symptoms and preventing it from becoming worse. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I told you, I don't think so. I never had a bad reaction to anything. I can take pills, if you think it's necessary. I just... I not like taking too many. I worry about side effects, you know? I’m a strong woman, I usually just push through it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication, and I respect that. We don't want to prescribe anything unnecessary. Since it sounds like it's a relatively mild case and you don’t have a fever, we can start with some conservative measures. I recommend over-the-counter saline nasal sprays to help keep your nasal passages moist and clear. You can use those as often as needed. I also suggest taking over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed for any pain or discomfort. And most importantly, get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. I also want to advise you to avoid exposure to dust as much as possible, especially at work. If possible, consider wearing a mask to protect your sinuses. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, please come back and see me. We can then consider other options, such as a decongestant or, in rare cases, antibiotics. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Saline spray, pain relievers, rest, and… no dust. I can do that. My husband, he will be happy I rest. And I will be careful at work. A mask… yes, I can ask my boss for one. One week… if it not better, I come back. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad we could come up with a plan that you feel comfortable with. Remember, if you experience a high fever, severe headache, changes in vision, or swelling around your eyes, please seek immediate medical attention. I’m going to write up a brief summary of our conversation and these recommendations for you to take home. And I'll give you a work note excusing you for a few days if you think that would be helpful. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: A work note… yes, that would be good. My boss, he is… strict. Thank you. Um… no, I don’t think so. Just… I hope it goes away soon. I have a lot of work to do. And I want to feel better for my husband. Thank you again, Doctor. You very helpful. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I understand, and I hope you feel better soon too. Here is the work note, excusing you from work for three days. And here’s the summary of our visit and the recommendations. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you for everything. .
