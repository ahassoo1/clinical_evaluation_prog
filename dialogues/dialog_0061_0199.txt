DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Marquie. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks. It’s…well, I’ve been getting really short of breath lately. Like, I can’t really do much without getting winded. It's been…a little worrying, to be honest. I don’t…remember exactly when it started, but it's definitely been a few weeks.
DOCTOR: "Okay, a few weeks of shortness of breath. That is worrying, and you're right to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s not like a sudden thing, it just…gradually got worse. I feel it when I walk up the stairs, mostly. Even just walking to the mailbox sometimes. It’s…hard to explain. Like, I can breathe, but it feels like I'm not getting enough air. My chest feels…tight, maybe? I don’t know. It's frustrating because I can't pinpoint anything that causes it, you know? It just…happens.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so it’s a gradual onset, triggered by exertion like walking or stairs, and you feel like you’re not getting a full breath with some chest tightness. And it doesn't seem to be related to anything specific happening at the time, just comes on. Do you notice it happening at other times, like when you're resting or lying down, or only with activity?
PATIENT: That’s…yeah, that’s pretty much it. Hmm… mostly with activity, I think. When I'm resting, I'm okay. Usually. Sometimes, if I lie down flat for a long time, I feel a little…like there’s pressure on my chest? But it’s not as bad as when I'm moving around. My wife says I snore a lot, but I don't remember much about that.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so mostly with activity, a little pressure on your chest when lying flat, and your wife has mentioned snoring. That's good information. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Better… hmm. Sitting up usually helps. If I’m feeling short of breath, I just sit down for a bit and it calms down. And… honestly? Not much else. I haven't really tried anything specific. I figured I'd just…wait it out. Which I guess wasn't the best idea.
DOCTOR: "Waiting it out isn't usually the best idea when it comes to shortness of breath, you're right. And sitting up helps, that's good to know. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I’ve never really been sick, honestly. I mean, the usual colds, but nothing serious. I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time. Years. Maybe ten years? I just… haven't needed to. I work at the water treatment plant, so I get a yearly checkup through them, but that’s mostly just to make sure I’m healthy enough for the job. They haven’t ever said anything about my breathing.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses, haven't seen a doctor regularly, and your work checkups haven’t noted anything about your breathing. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was it. Mostly just bumps and bruises over the years.
DOCTOR: "Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—have any health problems like asthma, heart disease, lung problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… we don’t really talk about health stuff much. My dad had some problems with his… I think it was high blood pressure, maybe? And my mom… she had arthritis, I think. Nothing about lungs or breathing that I remember, though. My siblings are healthy, as far as I know. We don't see each other much, so I don’t really know what’s going on with them.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so some high blood pressure and arthritis in the family, but nothing specific about lung or heart problems. Let's talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife… she used to smoke, a long time ago, but she quit years ago. I've always avoided it. Bad for your health, you know?
DOCTOR: "Good. That's excellent. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, sometimes. I have a beer or two with dinner on the weekends. Nothing crazy. Just a couple. I don’t drink during the week. It's mostly just… relaxing, you know?
DOCTOR: "Okay, a couple of beers on the weekends. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I mean, I’m a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, but that’s just seasonal stuff. Nothing serious. No allergies to medications, though.
DOCTOR: "Okay, seasonal pollen is the only thing you're aware of. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to eat healthy and get enough sleep, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: "Okay, no medications. Alright, Marquie, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: "Okay. Let's start with your oxygen saturation." "Your oxygen level is 96%, which is good. Now, if you could just take a deep breath in and out for me, please." “Okay, I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, and your breathing sounds a little bit diminished, especially when you take a deep breath. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. I also notice you're using some extra effort to breathe.” “I’m going to order a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And I'd like to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm more closely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. X-ray and EKG. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's happening, you know? It’s a little scary not knowing. When can I get those done?
DOCTOR: "I understand. It's definitely scary not knowing. We can get those done right away. The x-ray and EKG are both done here in the clinic, and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes each. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, come in and get you set up. While we're waiting for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… what do you think it could be? Is it serious? I mean, I need to get back to work, you know? People rely on me at the plant.
DOCTOR: "I understand your concern about work, and it's good you're thinking about that. It's too early to say definitively what's going on until we get the results of the x-ray and EKG. The wheezing I heard suggests there might be some inflammation or narrowing in your airways, which could be caused by a number of things – anything from a mild infection to asthma. The diminished breath sounds and increased effort to breathe could indicate some fluid buildup or restriction. We need those tests to give you a clearer picture. I want to reassure you that we'll work quickly to figure out what's happening and get you the right treatment. It's possible it’s something we can manage easily, but we need to rule out anything more serious first. Do you have any family or friends who could accompany you to follow-up appointments, if needed?
PATIENT: Yeah, my wife, Elena, could. She’s usually pretty good about that. I just… I don't want it to be anything serious. I need to get back to work, like I said. It’s… a lot of responsibility. I just hope it's not something that will keep me away from it for long. It’s just… the thought of letting people down…
DOCTOR: "I understand completely, Marquie. It's admirable that you take your responsibilities so seriously. We’ll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and treatment plan quickly so you can get back to work and take care of what you need to. Maria will be in shortly to get you started with the tests. Try not to worry too much right now, and remember we're here to help. I'll be reviewing the results as soon as they're available and will come back to discuss them with you. If you start feeling significantly worse before I get back – if you have trouble breathing or experience chest pain – please let Maria or me know immediately."
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I’ll try not to worry. I guess I’ll just…wait for the results.
DOCTOR: "You're very welcome, Marquie. That’s all we can do right now. Maria will be in in just a moment. "
