DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just been feelin’ sick, on and off. Mostly a fever, comes back a few days after it goes away. It’s been happenin’ for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, maybe a little longer. I just want it to stop, you know? It's tiring.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Three weeks, you say, with a recurring fever. That is concerning. Can you describe the fever to me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a shakin’ chill, not usually. More like… warm. Really warm. I don't usually bother takin’ my temperature, honestly. My wife does when she gets worried. Usually around 101, 102, she says. But it'll go down with some Tylenol, then come back a few days later. It's not constant, not a high fever all the time. Just… keepin’ comin’ back.
DOCTOR: Right. Intermittent fever, responding to Tylenol. And how high would you estimate it gets without medication?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven't really pushed it to find out. When I start feelin’ warm, I just take the Tylenol. Don't like feelin' awful, you know? But, I guess… maybe 103, 104 before the Tylenol kicks in? Hard to say exactly. My wife is the one who keeps track of all that. She worries more than I do. It's just…annoying, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fluctuating fever, potentially reaching 103-104 Fahrenheit before medication, and relieved by Tylenol. Beyond the fever, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Now that you mention it... I get kinda tired. Real tired. Not just sleepy, but like… weak. And sometimes my muscles ache, especially in my back. No cough or nothin', no sniffles. Just… tired and achy. And a little bit of a headache, comes and goes with the fever, I think. Oh, and no appetite when I’m feelin’ bad. Not hungry at all.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, muscle aches, headache correlating with the fever, and loss of appetite. And this has been going on for three weeks, alongside this recurring fever. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no. Nothing like that. No stomach trouble at all. Just the tired, achy, and warm. It’s… it’s just wearin’ me down, Doc. Been tryin' to keep workin', you know? Gotta pay the bills. But it's hard when you feel like garbage. And I don't have insurance, so… I'm tryin’ to get this figured out quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brege. No gastrointestinal symptoms, which is good. And I appreciate you letting me know about the lack of insurance – we’ll certainly keep that in mind as we proceed. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently, or had any contact with anyone who has been sick?
PATIENT: No travel, no. Been right here in town. And… hmm. Old Man Hemandez down the street had a bad cough a couple weeks ago, but that's about it. We just waved hello at each other, didn't get close. I don't really get around much these days. Mostly just work and home. It’s not like I’ve been on a plane or nothin'. Just… feelin’ sick. This whole thing is a nuisance, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent travel, limited contact with others, and only a passing interaction with someone who had a cough. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. My wife keeps tellin’ me I need to watch my salt, but… I don’t have any official conditions. Doc's always said my blood pressure was a little high, but they never put me on pills for it. Just told me to watch my diet. I go to the chiropractor regular, for my back, but that’s about it. Otherwise, just an old man feelin’ a little under the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. My wife always said I was too stubborn to go to the hospital. Said I’d just get in the way. So I just tough it out. Usually works. This fever though… this is different. It keeps comin’ back.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, regarding your family history - are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mom had…arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. And my dad… he had heart trouble later in life. Had to watch his diet, too. But that’s about all I know. We weren’t a family that talked much about health stuff, you know? Just kinda dealt with things as they came. I don't think there was any cancer or nothin' serious like that. Just the usual old age problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of arthritis and late-onset heart disease. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Never had a reaction to nothin'. I can eat anything, take most pills without a problem. I’m pretty lucky that way, too. My wife always jokes that I’ve got a cast iron stomach. Just wish it was feelin' a little better right now.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Brege, thank you for that information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Tylenol, when I got the fever. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I forget to take it half the time. My wife buys it for me, says I need it. But no prescription pills, no nothin' regular. Just the Tylenol when I need it. And sometimes the multivitamin, when I remember. Honestly, I’m not much of a pill-taker. Just want to feel normal again, Doc. Is this somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. No regular medications, just Tylenol as needed and occasional multivitamins. Given your symptoms of recurring fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and headache for three weeks, despite Tylenol, we need to investigate this further. It’s unlikely to be a simple cold or flu given the duration and recurring nature. I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes. Then we can discuss some possible laboratory tests. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… alright. Physical exam sounds fine. I just want to figure out what’s wrong. And get this over with. I got things to do, you know? But if you think it’s necessary, go ahead. Just… try to be quick, if you can? And explain what you’re doin’, so I know what’s goin’ on. I don’t like bein’ surprised.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brege. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take things at your pace. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Your temperature is 101.2 Fahrenheit. Pulse is 88 beats per minute, regular. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now I’ll palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Finally, I’m going to check your lymph nodes. No significant lymphadenopathy noted. Overall, the physical exam is relatively unremarkable, but the persistent fever warrants further investigation. Do you feel any discomfort when I press on your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, nothin'. It doesn’t hurt when you press on my stomach. Like you said, nothin' much feels wrong. I just feel tired and warm. That's all. It’s just…annoying, this whole thing. So, what's next, Doc? You said somethin' about tests? What kinda tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I got work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Given your symptoms and exam findings, I'd like to order a complete blood count with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a basic urinalysis. The CBC will help us look for signs of infection or inflammation, the CMP will assess your kidney and liver function, and the urinalysis can rule out a urinary tract infection. These are relatively standard blood and urine tests. It should take about 24-48 hours to get the results back from the lab. We can call you with the results as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing to take Tylenol as needed for fever and discomfort. Are you able to provide a urine sample now?
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess I can. Just tell me where to go. I ain't done one of those in… well, a long time. And you said 24 to 48 hours? That's kinda long. I really need to know what's wrong soon. I got bills to pay. But okay, I’ll do the test. Just point me to the bathroom. And you'll call me when you have the results? Not have me call you?
DOCTOR: Yes, the restroom is just down the hall to your right. There’s a sterile cup in there; please collect a mid-stream sample – meaning start urinating, then collect a sample mid-way through. And yes, we will call you as soon as the results are available. We understand your concerns about needing to know quickly, and we’ll do our best to expedite the process. We'll also leave a message if we can’t reach you, with instructions on how to proceed. Do you have any questions about collecting the sample, or anything else before you head to the restroom?
PATIENT: Nah, I think I remember how to do it. Mid-stream, right? Start and stop. Okay. Just… I hope it's nothin' serious, Doc. I ain't got time for a long illness. I’ll go do the thing. Just call me when you got somethin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Take your time. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And please, don’t hesitate to call us if you experience any worsening symptoms in the meantime. We’ll be right here.
