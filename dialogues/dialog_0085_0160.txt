DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day for this. It’s this tiredness, see. Just…dragging. And it’s gotten worse. Plus, I’ve been…well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been craving dirt. Real dirt. Not like, garden dirt with fertilizer, but…the stuff from the ground. Don’t look at me like that. It’s awful, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand. It's good you're telling me everything, and please don't feel embarrassed – we’re here to figure things out. The tiredness and the craving for dirt… those are both important things to discuss. Let's start with the tiredness. When did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been…a while. Probably six months, maybe longer? It just crept up on me. At first, I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it's not just a little sleepy, it's…everything feels heavy. Like wading through mud. And it doesn’t go away with rest. Honestly, I used to be a much more active person. Now? Forget about it. I barely have the energy to… well, never mind. It's just tiring talking about it, too.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. It sounds very frustrating. Six months of increasing fatigue… and not relieved by rest. That’s definitely something we need to investigate. You said it feels like wading through mud – can you describe any other sensations?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. Everything feels…dull. Not just tired, but like my brain is foggy. And my muscles ache, even when I haven't done anything. I used to enjoy my gardening, you know, but now even bending over to pull a weed feels like too much. And I’m… forgetful. Not like, major memory loss, but little things. Where I put my keys, what I was about to say. Things like that. It's just…annoying. Are we getting anywhere with this? I really don’t have a lot of time today.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candis, we are. The dullness, muscle aches, and increasing forgetfulness… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. It sounds like it's significantly impacting your daily life, and we want to get to the bottom of it. Now, let’s go back to the craving for dirt. When did that start?
PATIENT: About…three months ago, I think. It started with just a little taste, you know? I was in the garden and…I don’t know, it just sounded good. I chalked it up to being odd. But now… now I really have to fight the urge. It’s awful. I feel ridiculous admitting this to a doctor. It’s not like I’m eating rocks! Just…earth. And it doesn't help with the tiredness, obviously. Makes my stomach upset, mostly. Why are you looking at me like that?
DOCTOR: Candis, I assure you, I'm not judging. Unusual cravings can be a symptom of several different things, and it's important to understand what's going on. It's good you're being honest with me. It’s important to note you’re experiencing gastrointestinal upset related to this. Now, have you noticed any other unusual cravings, or changes in your appetite in general?
PATIENT: No. Just the dirt. I haven’t been eating any more or less than usual, nothing like that. And I don’t feel sick, other than the stomach problems after I… indulge. It's just this constant tiredness, this foggy feeling, and this ridiculous urge for dirt. Honestly, I’m starting to think I’m losing my mind. And I don’t have insurance, so I can't afford a lot of tests. Just… what's the point of all this, if it's going to cost a fortune?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Candis. We'll do our best to be mindful of that. It's not necessarily a sign of losing your mind, but it is a sign that something is going on, and we need to investigate. I want to start with a thorough physical exam and some basic bloodwork. The bloodwork will help us check for things like iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid problems—things that can cause fatigue and unusual cravings. Before we do that, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, fine. Past medical history… let’s see. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, a really bad case. And I broke my wrist when I was gardening, about ten years ago. Other than that? Nothing much. I haven’t been to a doctor in…well, a long time. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my vegetables, get some exercise when I can. It’s just… this is different. It feels like something is really wrong, and I don't want to waste my time with tests that won't show anything. Can we just… skip the tests and give me something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand your frustration and wanting to avoid unnecessary tests. However, it’s important to rule out some potential causes before we consider other options. While I respect your wishes, skipping tests entirely wouldn’t be in your best interest. Let’s do a physical exam first, and then we can discuss a limited set of bloodwork. It will give us a better starting point. Before we begin, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. Look, are we really going to spend all day with this? I have errands to run, and I promised my neighbor I’d help her with her tomatoes. Can we just get this over with? I don’t understand why you need to poke and prod me. It won’t tell you anything. Honestly, I feel like I’m wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Candis, and I apologize if this feels like a waste of time. But a physical exam is a crucial part of the process. It allows me to assess your overall health and identify any potential physical signs that might be contributing to your symptoms. It’s a quick process, and it will give us valuable information. I promise to be as efficient as possible. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and then doing a quick neurological exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up. And don’t ask me a lot of questions. I just want to get this over with and go home. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. I'm a sensible woman, I know my body, and I just need something to give me some energy. I don't need a lot of poking and prodding and tests. Just… let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. We will. If you could please sit here, and I will begin the exam. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little fast, but otherwise, everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little high. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and assess your neurological function.
