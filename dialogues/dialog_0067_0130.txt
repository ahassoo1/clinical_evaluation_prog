DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my family... they have a lot of... problems. With sickness, you know? My mother, she... she had a bad heart. And my brother, he had... something with his stomach. I just want to make sure I'm okay. I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It’s good you’re thinking about this. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little more about what specifically you're worried about?
PATIENT: Worried? Well... everything, I guess. My mother... she was always tired. And then her legs... they would swell up. And my brother... he was always in pain. Big pain in his belly. I don’t have those things yet, but I worry it will happen. I eat okay, I think. And I walk… sometimes. Not every day, though. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, you’re experiencing some anxiety about potentially developing similar health issues as your mother and brother, and you haven’t noticed any specific symptoms yet. You mentioned your mother had fatigue and leg swelling, and your brother had stomach pain. Let’s start with you. Have you been feeling any fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Hmm... fatigue? Well, I get tired. But everyone gets tired, right? I work hard, selling things... it's a lot of walking and talking. Sometimes I come home and just... sit. Is that fatigue? I don't know. It’s not like… can’t get out of bed tired, you know? More like… just want to rest.
DOCTOR: That’s a good distinction to make, Mr. Schwer. "Just wanting to rest" after a long day of work is quite different than feeling debilitating exhaustion. So, it sounds like the tiredness you’re experiencing is probably related to your job. Let's talk about your legs. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. My feet… they hurt sometimes. From all the walking. But not swollen. They just… ache. Like they’ve been working too hard. Does that make sense? I wear good shoes, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Foot pain from walking is very common, especially with your profession. It sounds like that's likely related to the physical demands of your job as well. Now, let's move on to your stomach. Have you been experiencing any pain, discomfort, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, no pain. My stomach… it’s okay. Maybe a little… gassy sometimes? Old age, probably. I eat… normal food, I guess. Not too much junk food. Everything goes… you know… regular. Sorry if that’s… too much information.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schwer. That's very helpful information. It's important to get a complete picture. So, no significant stomach pain, just occasional gas, and regular bowel movements. That's good to hear. Just to get a broader understanding of your health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And… the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back. He gave me a pill, but… I didn’t like how it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. Bad, I know. My wife… she told me to keep taking it. But she’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Schwer. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. It takes a lot of courage to talk about these things. So, you had your appendix removed as a young man and were diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but stopped taking the medication due to side effects. We’ll definitely need to revisit that blood pressure. Do you currently take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for my knee. It gets sore when it rains. Just a little painkiller. Over-the-counter stuff. You can buy it at the store. I forget the name… something with “-profen” in it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an over-the-counter pain reliever for your knee, containing "-profen." That's good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all kinds of food. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes if I eat something spicy. But that's just… old age again.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. To help me get a complete picture of your health, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past. Were there any significant illnesses in your family, other than your mother's heart condition and your brother's stomach problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandfather… he had something with his lungs. He smoked a lot. And my aunt… she had diabetes. Sugar sickness, they called it. And… I think my cousin had cancer. A long time ago. Everyone gets sick, you know? It’s just… part of life.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Schwer. Illness is unfortunately a part of life. Thank you for sharing that information about your family history – grandfather with lung issues , aunt with diabetes, and cousin with cancer. This is all very helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Never smoked. Tried it once when I was young, didn’t like it. And… I don’t drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Special occasions. And… no drugs. Never touched them. My wife… she didn’t like those things either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schwer. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about what you do for work?
PATIENT: I sell things. Wholesale. To stores, you know? I drive around… visit different shops. Talk to the owners… try to get them to buy my stuff. It's a lot of walking and talking. And… sometimes lifting boxes. Not too heavy, though. Mostly just… paperwork and driving. Long hours, though. Long hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your work involves a lot of walking, talking, some lifting, and long hours of driving and paperwork. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and taking a look at your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. My wife… she always said I should go to the doctor more often. I just… put it off. It's not my favorite thing. But… I guess it’s good to check. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150/90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s not overly concerning at this point, but we’ll make note of it. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Does that cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Hmm… maybe a little. Sometimes. After I eat. It’s not… bad pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like… full. I just thought it was… old age again. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me about this, Mr. Schwer. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant after eating could be a number of things. It's not necessarily bad, but it’s something we need to investigate further. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These tests will check your liver function, kidney function, and your blood sugar levels. We’ll also do a complete blood count to look at your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best. My wife… she always said I should listen to the doctor. I just… don't like needles. But… if you think it’s important, I’ll do it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly normal to dislike needles. We'll get it over with quickly. I'm also going to order an abdominal ultrasound. This will give us a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and other organs in your abdomen. It’s a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? No needles? That’s good. Sounds better. What… what will it show? Is something wrong? I’m starting to worry now. My brother… he had a lot of tests before… before he… you know.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you’re feeling worried, Mr. Schwer. It’s natural to feel anxious when you’re facing medical tests, especially with a family history of illness. The ultrasound will give us a detailed image of your abdominal organs. It can help us identify any potential problems, such as gallstones, liver disease, or other abnormalities. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong. It's just a way for us to get more information and rule things out. We're being proactive here. We'll use the results of the blood tests and ultrasound to get a clearer picture of your health. Based on those results, we can determine if any further testing or treatment is needed. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about the ultrasound procedure itself?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And… will it hurt? My brother… he had a lot of pain. I don’t want any pain. That’s all. I just want to know if I’m okay.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. You're understandably worried about pain, and you just want to know if you're okay. The ultrasound shouldn’t cause any pain at all. A technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a handheld device over your skin. It may feel a little cool, but it won't hurt. The results will typically be available within a few days. Once they’re ready, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or jaundice , please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about scheduling the follow-up appointment or contacting the clinic?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For explaining everything. My wife… she would have liked you. She always made sure I went to the doctor. I just… I’m scared. But I guess… I guess it’s good to know. I’ll… I’ll schedule the appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It’s my job to explain everything as clearly as possible and to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. And it sounds like you had a wonderful wife who cared deeply about your health. It’s okay to be scared. Facing the unknown is always difficult. But we’re here to support you every step of the way. Our receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment for when the test results are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll… I’ll go schedule the appointment now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We'll see you soon.
