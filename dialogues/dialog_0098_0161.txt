DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I come talk about… something to help prevent HIV. I don’t really know much about it, but she said it’s a good idea to get checked out, just in case. I’m a bit worried, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you to come in, Helaina. It’s always good to be proactive about your health. Your friend is right to suggest looking into preventative measures. We can certainly discuss HIV prevention options, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. To start, can you tell me a little more about why your friend suggested you consider this?
PATIENT: Well, she… she just said things are becoming more common, even for people like me, you know? Older, single… not necessarily looking for a lot of partners, but… things happen. And she mentioned a pill you could take, to be safe. She didn’t know the name, just that it works. I work as a parking attendant, so I’m around a lot of people all day, and I guess she thought… well, she didn’t say exactly, but I got the feeling she was worried about something happening. It’s probably silly.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Helaina. It’s responsible to consider these things, and your friend is thoughtful to bring it to your attention. It sounds like she’s referring to PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It’s a medication taken daily to prevent HIV infection. To see if PrEP is right for you, I need to ask a few questions, if that’s alright. We’ll go through your medical history and discuss your risk factors. First, can you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds good. Medical history… hmm. Let me think. I haven’t had any major illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, rubella – all that was taken care of when I was little. I had my appendix out when I was twenty, but that was ages ago and no problems since. I’ve got high blood pressure, which I take medication for – Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago. Otherwise, pretty healthy, all things considered. I go for regular checkups with my primary care doctor, Dr. Khalil, but we don’t usually talk about… this kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Lisinopril for high blood pressure, hysterectomy ten years ago, and otherwise generally healthy. That’s good to know. Do you know what your blood pressure readings usually are?
PATIENT: Usually… hmm. Dr. Khalil always tells me it's good when I'm taking my medication. Around 120 over 80, I think? Sometimes a little higher if I’m stressed, but usually around there. I try to keep an eye on it. I have a home monitor, but I don’t always remember to use it. Honestly, it's a bit of a hassle.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Helaina. Around 120/80 on your medication is excellent. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t always remember to use the home monitor – consistency can be tricky. Now, you mentioned a hysterectomy ten years ago. Were there any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: No, no complications, thankfully. Everything went smoothly. I recovered well, and Dr. Khalil said it was a success. It was just… a necessary thing, you know? Nothing to do with… this. I just wanted to make sure you had all the information.
DOCTOR: Of course, and thank you for sharing that. It's good to know everything went well. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I eat everything – I love food! No reactions to any medications I’ve ever taken, and I haven’t got any skin allergies, or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. My mother always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Helaina! A strong stomach is always a good thing. Now, I'm going to ask about your social history, if you don't mind. This helps me understand your overall health and risk factors. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… I used to smoke, years ago, when I was younger. But I quit about twenty years ago. Doctor Khalil was very pleased with me! I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested. I'm a pretty straight-laced person, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Helaina. Quitting smoking is a huge accomplishment, and a glass or two of wine a week is perfectly reasonable. Now, let's talk about sexual history. I understand this can be a sensitive topic, but it's important for assessing your risk for HIV and determining if PrEP is right for you. Have you had any sexual activity in the past six months?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a little awkward, Doctor. Um… not really. I haven’t had… a partner in quite a long time. A few dates, here and there, but nothing serious. And nothing… intimate, if you know what I mean. I'm not actively seeking anything, but… well, you never know. Is that enough information? I'm a bit embarrassed to talk about this, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Helaina. Thank you for being open with me. It's very common to feel awkward discussing these things, and I completely understand. It’s good you're being honest. It sounds like your recent sexual activity has been minimal, which is helpful information. Just to clarify, and again, only if you're comfortable sharing, have you ever been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a hint of one. I always… well, I used to be very careful. And now… there hasn't been much need for it, if that makes sense. I haven't had a sexual health check-up in a while, though. It's been a long time since… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Helaina. No previous STI diagnoses is helpful. And it's alright that you haven’t had a check-up recently. We can certainly order one today as part of the PrEP screening process. It’s standard procedure. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I don’t mind at all. I suppose I should have expected that, shouldn’t I? Blood pressure first, you said? I just hope it’s not too high, I was a bit flustered talking about… all of that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Helaina. It's natural to feel a little flustered discussing personal matters. We’ll take it one step at a time. Okay, your blood pressure is 132 over 86. A little elevated, but not concerning given the circumstances. Your heart rate is 78, which is normal, and your lungs sound clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Do you have any history of heart problems or murmurs?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. My mother had a little flutter sometimes, but Dr. Khalil said it wasn’t anything to worry about. He checked me out every year. I don't think I've ever had any problems. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds detected. Everything sounds good. Now, to proceed with assessing your suitability for PrEP, we'll need to order some blood tests. These tests will check your kidney function, liver function, and screen for any existing HIV or other sexually transmitted infections. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That makes sense. Whatever you need. I just want to be sure, you know? I'd rather be safe than sorry. I hope it doesn’t take too long to get the results. I have a bridge club meeting on Thursday, and I’d like to know before then, if possible.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible attitude, Helaina. I completely understand. We'll get the orders in right away. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to return the results, so we should have them before your bridge club meeting on Thursday. I'll have the nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me about PrEP, the testing process, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Well… um… is it a difficult pill to take? Does it have a lot of side effects? I don’t want to feel sick all the time, or have to worry about remembering it. And… is it expensive? My Medicare doesn't cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Helaina. Let's address them one by one. PrEP is typically a once-daily pill, and for most people, it's very well tolerated. Some people experience mild side effects initially, like nausea or fatigue, but these usually subside within a few weeks. Serious side effects are rare. As for remembering it, it's best taken at the same time each day, and some people find it helpful to set a reminder on their phone. Regarding cost, PrEP can be expensive, but there are programs available to help reduce the cost, even with Medicare. We can connect you with a patient assistance program that may cover a significant portion of the cost, or even the entire cost, depending on your income and insurance coverage. We'll explore those options once we have your test results and confirm you're a good candidate for PrEP. Does that address your concerns, or is there anything else I can clarify?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot better, actually. Thank you. The patient assistance program sounds good. I wouldn't want to break the bank for this. I suppose if it keeps me safe, and it's not too expensive, it might be worth it. I think that’s all my questions, for now. What happens next? Do I just wait for the nurse to call?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Helaina. You just wait for the nurse to call with your test results. Once we have those, we’ll discuss them with you in detail, and if everything looks good, we can talk about starting PrEP. The nurse will also help you enroll in the patient assistance program if you’re interested. I'm glad I could address your concerns. Remember, I'm here if you have any questions or worries that come up before then. Do you have any other medical concerns that I can assist you with today, or are we all set for now?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything, I think. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And for not laughing at my questions! It's a bit embarrassing getting old and having to worry about… all of this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. And please, don't be embarrassed. It's always a good idea to be proactive about your health, no matter your age. It was my pleasure to assist you. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your bridge club meeting on Thursday!
