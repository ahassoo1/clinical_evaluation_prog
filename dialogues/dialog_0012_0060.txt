DOCTOR: Hi Blain, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, it’s probably nothing, honestly. My family… we just have a history. Lots of… things. My aunt had something, then my uncle, and now my cousin is going through tests. I just want to make sure I’m okay. Preventative, you know? I don’t want to end up like them. It’s… stressful, worrying all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – it’s really smart to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history you're concerned about. And it is stressful worrying, absolutely. It's good you're taking this seriously. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about what your aunt and uncle had?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It was… complicated. My aunt, she had… some kind of cancer, I think. It was years ago, before everything was so… online. My mom mostly handled it and didn’t really go into details. And my uncle… that was even worse. Something with his heart, I think. Lots of tests, then… well, he just… wasn’t around much after that. It was all very sad, but also… private. They didn’t really talk about it much, and frankly, I didn't push. I just know it was bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you have some anxiety about potential inherited conditions, and it’s difficult when details are scarce. That’s perfectly reasonable. To help me understand what might be relevant for you, let’s try to narrow things down a bit, even if we’re working with limited information. Do you know what type of cancer your aunt had, even generally – like, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. My mom would just say “cancer.” Like it was… a single thing. I vaguely remember something about… her having surgery? And then… chemo? But I was pretty young. Like, ten or eleven. It was a long time ago. She didn’t like talking about it. And again, my uncle… heart failure, maybe? Something with his arteries, I think. Everyone just said he wasn’t strong. Which felt… dismissive, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's really common for families to avoid discussing difficult medical histories, and it can make it hard to get the information you need. It also sounds like you felt their concerns weren’t taken seriously, which is frustrating. Okay, so we have limited information about cancer and possible heart issues. Let's switch gears for a moment. How about you?
PATIENT: What do you mean? Like… am I feeling okay? Yes, fine. I mean, I work, I eat reasonably well, I try to get some sleep. I don't smoke or anything. I guess I'm a little stressed, but who isn't these days? I'm here because of them, not because I'm feeling sick. I just want to make sure I don’t end up with whatever they had.
DOCTOR: That's completely valid. You're being proactive, which is great. It's good you're thinking ahead. To get a better baseline, let's do a quick review of your health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, a few ear infections. But I’ve never been seriously ill. I haven’t even broken a bone. I’m… annoyingly healthy, I guess. Which is why I’m worried, honestly. It feels like it's only a matter of time before something goes wrong, considering my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear – a clean medical history is a great starting point. And I understand your anxiety; it’s natural to feel that way with a family history you’re concerned about. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than those childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: No, never. Honestly, the closest I’ve come to a hospital is visiting my aunt when… well, you know. It’s all very unpleasant. I've always been pretty careful. And lucky, I guess. I just want to… stay that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good information. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't even take a multivitamin. I try to get everything I need from my food. I don't really believe in all that stuff, honestly. Seems like everyone’s trying to sell you something.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. That simplifies things. Now, do you have any allergies – to food, medications, insect stings, anything at all?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, ever. Seriously, I'm remarkably un-sensitive. It’s… almost suspicious, isn't it? But again, I'm worried something will happen. It feels like I’m building up to something bad.
DOCTOR: It’s not suspicious, Blain, it just means you haven't had an allergic reaction yet! And I understand your feeling of building up to something – that’s the anxiety talking. We’re going to work through this systematically. To continue building a complete picture, let's talk about your family a little more. Besides your aunt and uncle, is there anyone else in your immediate family – parents, siblings – who has had significant medical issues, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke?
PATIENT: My dad… he has high blood pressure, I think. He takes pills for it. And my mom… she's pretty healthy, actually. Always has been. She just gets tired easily. And I don't have any siblings. It was just me. Honestly, my mom always downplayed everything. Like she didn’t want to worry me. Which is… nice, I guess, but doesn’t really help me now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your dad has high blood pressure, and your mom is generally healthy but gets tired easily. That's useful information. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. I definitely don’t drink every day. And I don’t binge drink or anything like that. My ex… she drank a lot. That wasn't fun.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol consumption. And do you use any tobacco products – cigarettes, vaping devices, chewing tobacco?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked anything. It smells awful, and it’s bad for you. I’ve never understood why anyone would do it. Seriously, it makes no sense. And I definitely don't vape. That seems even worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no tobacco use. And finally, let's talk about your work. What do you do, and would you describe it as physically demanding or stressful?
PATIENT: I’m an engineering teacher, postsecondary. So, mostly lecturing, grading papers, running labs… it’s not physically hard, but it can be… draining. Dealing with students all day… sometimes it’s exhausting. And there’s always pressure to keep the curriculum up-to-date, to get good evaluations. It’s… a job. It pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, an engineering teacher – that sounds demanding in its own way. And finally, just to be complete, could you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Fine. I’m… 181 centimeters. And… 60 kilograms. Yes, I know, I’m a bit… thin. It’s just… my metabolism, I guess. I eat enough. It’s just how I’m built.
DOCTOR: Okay, 181 centimeters and 60 kilograms. Thank you for being so open with me, Blain. That gives me a good overall picture of your health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I just want to know if I’m about to drop dead or not. Seriously, the suspense is worse than anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Blain, and we'll take things one step at a time. This will just be a routine check – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Your blood pressure is 118 over 72, which is excellent. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and clear. Lungs are clear as well. No wheezing or crackles. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling. Reflexes are normal. Everything sounds and looks normal during the physical exam. That's very reassuring. However, given your family history, I would like to order some routine blood work, just to get a baseline and rule out any potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think is best. Honestly, if it'll put my mind at ease, yes. Just… try not to find anything bad, okay? I really don’t want to deal with that right now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Blain. We'll take it one step at a time. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health, including your blood sugar, kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, unexplained weight loss, or persistent fatigue – please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… what if something is wrong? What happens then? I just… I don't want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid fear, and it’s okay to feel anxious about that. If something is wrong, we'll discuss all your options. We’ll look at treatment plans, potential specialists, and, most importantly, we’ll work together to create a plan that you’re comfortable with. It’s important to remember that just because a family member had a certain condition doesn’t mean you will. Many conditions have a genetic component, but lifestyle factors, early detection, and advances in medicine play a huge role. We’ll cross that bridge when and if we come to it. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and getting a baseline. And please remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you need a work/school note for missing time for the bloodwork appointment?
PATIENT: No. I don't want to deal with that right now. I'll just… figure something out. Thanks, I guess. I really hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll have the lab order and appointment information ready for you at the front desk. And I truly hope so too, Blain. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you for being so open with me today. It takes courage to address these concerns, and I'm glad you came in. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
