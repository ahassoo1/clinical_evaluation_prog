DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Thank you. Well, to be frank, I’ve been having some… bladder pressure. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bladder pressure can certainly be bothersome. “A little while now” – could you elaborate on that timeframe for me, Marialena?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It began, I believe, approximately three weeks ago. It started very mildly, just a slight discomfort after I use the restroom, but it has gradually increased in intensity. It’s not painful, exactly, but… persistent, you understand? And it feels like I don’t fully empty my bladder sometimes, even after I’ve just gone.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Persistent pressure and the sensation of incomplete emptying… those are important details. And to clarify, this discomfort is specifically after urination?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Specifically after I urinate. It doesn't happen while I'm going, thankfully. It's more like a lingering… fullness, and then a sort of… pressure in my lower abdomen afterwards. It’s difficult to describe precisely.
DOCTOR: You're describing it perfectly well, Marialena. It sounds like there’s some residual discomfort. Now, let’s try to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Yes, I have, actually. The frequency has increased slightly, I’d say. I’m going to the restroom perhaps one or two more times a day than usual. And… sometimes I do feel a bit of urgency, a sudden need to go. The color and odor seem normal, though. I haven't noticed anything unusual there.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency and occasional urgency… thank you. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any previous urinary tract infections, or any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve been very fortunate, health-wise, thankfully. I’ve never had a urinary tract infection, or any significant medical problems, really. Just the usual childhood illnesses, many years ago. I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Marialena. And Medicare is certainly relevant for billing purposes, thank you for mentioning that. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. Never any surgeries. I’ve always been careful, and… well, I’ve simply not needed them. Is something serious potentially wrong, Doctor? I apologize for asking directly, but it’s on my mind.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned, Marialena. It’s my job to address those concerns. At this point, it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but your symptoms do warrant investigation. Many things can cause bladder pressure and the sensation of incomplete emptying, and most are quite treatable. To help me narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of urinary problems, kidney disease, or other related conditions in your family?
PATIENT: That's… reassuring to hear, thank you, Doctor. My mother had some kidney stones when she was older, perhaps in her seventies, but that was the only thing I can think of. And she had those removed, so it wasn’t a long-term issue. My father was generally very healthy, and I don’t recall any urinary problems on his side of the family. Is kidney stones a possibility, then?
DOCTOR: It’s a possibility, though less likely given your description of the symptoms. But it’s important to consider all potential causes. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s it. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible. I work as a graphic designer, so I spend a lot of time sitting, unfortunately. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And yes, prolonged sitting can sometimes contribute to urinary issues, so it is relevant. Lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not currently taking any medications at all. Nothing prescribed, nothing over the counter, and no supplements either. I prefer to avoid them if I can. Do you think we should do some tests, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, Marialena, I believe some testing is the best course of action. I’d like to start with a urinalysis – a simple urine sample – to check for infection or other abnormalities. I'd also like to perform a quick physical exam, just to assess your abdomen and rule out any tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A urinalysis and a physical exam. Certainly. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll have you step behind the privacy screen to collect a urine sample. There are instructions posted there, and the lab technician can assist you if needed. After that, we'll return here and I'll perform the abdominal exam. It’s quite straightforward; I’ll simply be listening to your abdomen and gently pressing on it to check for any discomfort. Are you ready to proceed with the urine sample now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Just point me in the right direction, and I’ll get it done. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It does make me feel a little better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. That's my job – to help you understand what's going on and to find the best course of treatment. The restroom is just down the hall on your right. There's a specimen cup and instructions inside. When you’re finished, just bring the sample back to the little window here, and the lab technician will collect it. I'll be right here when you return. Take your time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
