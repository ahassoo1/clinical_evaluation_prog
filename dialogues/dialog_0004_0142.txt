DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… my head. It’s been giving me trouble again. Bad trouble. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s really something. I get all sweaty and my heart races, too. It's… hard to explain exactly what it feels like. Like a really bad pressure, but all over, not just in my head, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay. “Head trouble…comes and goes, with sweats and racing heart.” So, you’re experiencing headaches accompanied by those other symptoms. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. It’s… fuzzy. I think it was… a while ago now. Before the divorce, definitely. Maybe… six months before? It’s hard to put a date on it, everything’s a bit of a blur these days. It didn’t start right after, just… before things really got bad. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Six months prior to… recent events. Alright. And how often would you say these episodes occur?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. That varies, I guess. Sometimes it’ll be weeks between them, and then sometimes… like last month, it was three times in a week. It's pretty random. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it, which is… frustrating, to be honest. It makes it hard to plan things, worrying when one’s gonna hit.
DOCTOR: Random occurrence, fluctuating frequency. And when these episodes happen, how long do they typically last?
PATIENT: Ugh, usually… a couple of hours, I think. Sometimes it feels longer, like all day, but I guess it’s probably just a couple of hours. It starts pretty suddenly, gets really bad for a while, and then slowly fades away. It leaves me feeling completely wiped out afterward, though. Like I’ve run a marathon or something.
DOCTOR: A couple of hours, with significant post-episode fatigue. Do you notice anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: That's what I've been trying to figure out! I really don't. I mean, sometimes I’m stressed, but honestly, aren’t we all stressed these days? I haven’t noticed anything specific. Bright lights maybe? But I work in a warehouse, so there's bright lights all the time. I really have no idea. It just… happens. It's kind of scary, not knowing what sets it off.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Umm… It’s not really like a sharp pain, you know? It’s more like… a really intense pressure. All over my head, like a band tightening around it. And it kind of throbs, I guess. Not a constant throb, but it comes and goes. It’s hard to describe… it doesn’t feel like anything I’ve ever felt before. It’s definitely not a regular headache. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: A diffuse pressure, throbbing sensation. It doesn’t sound like a typical tension headache. Have you experienced any other symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Uhh… yeah, actually. Thinking about it… sometimes I feel a little nauseous, but I haven’t actually thrown up or anything. And… sometimes I get a bit dizzy. Not like spinning-room dizzy, just… off-balance. And… I think I'm more sensitive to light during one of these episodes, even more than usual in the warehouse. That's about it, I think. I'm trying to remember everything… it's… difficult.
DOCTOR: Nausea, dizziness, photophobia… Have you noticed any visual disturbances – like seeing spots or flashing lights – before or during these episodes?
PATIENT: Visual disturbances… now that you mention it… maybe? It's hard to say for sure. Sometimes things seem a little blurry, like I need to clean my glasses. But I wear glasses anyway, so I just figured it was that. I don't think I've seen any flashing lights, but… it's possible. I get so focused on the headache itself, I don't really pay attention to much else. I honestly couldn't say for certain. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Uhh… no, not really. Nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s about it. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but… no, nothing serious. The doctor always just told me to rest and drink fluids. I don’t really… go to the doctor much, to be honest. Never really had to. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: No prior medical history. Any family history of migraines or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Umm… good question. My mother had… bad headaches, I think. But she never really talked about it much. I think she just took pills for them. I don’t know if they were migraines or what. My father… he was pretty healthy, as far as I know. Didn’t have any major illnesses. I really don't know much about my family's medical history, to be honest. We weren’t really close. Sorry. It's not much help, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take ibuprofen sometimes, when the headaches are really bad, but that’s about it. And… I think I took some vitamins a while ago, but I stopped. I’m not really a big pill person, if you know what I mean. I just try to tough it out, usually. I don't really like taking anything if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I'm going to perform a brief neurological exam. I'll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. This will help me assess the situation.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if anything feels weird, right? And… just try to be gentle, if you don’t mind. I'm not really good with… medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please follow my finger with your eyes only, keeping your head still. Looking left… looking right… looking up… looking down. Good. Now, I’m going to check your pupillary response. Looking straight ahead… and relax. Both pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Relax your leg… and relax. Both reflexes are present and symmetrical. Now, stand up for me, please. Can you walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. That’s… okay. Woah, okay… This is… harder than it looks. I'm a little off balance. Sorry. I haven’t really… done this before. I feel a little dizzy now, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, please sit down. That’s alright. It’s good to know. Based on your history and this brief examination, your symptoms are concerning for a possible migraine condition, although further investigation is needed to rule out other possibilities. The slight unsteadiness could be related to the dizziness you experience during these episodes, or potentially something else. I want to order some bloodwork to check your basic metabolic panel and complete blood count. Additionally, I’m going to recommend a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be able to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Uh… that sounds… serious. Is something really wrong? Bloodwork I can handle, I guess. But a CT scan… Is it gonna… hurt? And what if it does find something? I… I’m not really good with… all this. I feel a little overwhelmed now. And… will my insurance cover all this? I haven't got a lot of money, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand your concern. A CT scan is a precautionary measure. It allows us to get a clear picture of your brain and rule out any serious underlying causes for your headaches. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. You will simply lie on a table while the scanner takes images. As for insurance, I realize you mentioned being uninsured. Our billing department will work with you to explore options and potentially set up a payment plan. We do have financial assistance programs available. We will not proceed with any tests without discussing the costs with you first. The primary goal right now is to determine the cause of your headaches and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. It's important to remember that most headaches are not caused by serious underlying problems. But we need to rule those possibilities out. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… a payment plan would be really good. That would definitely help. I just… I don’t want a big surprise bill, you know? And… it's good to know it's not probably something really bad. I guess. So, bloodwork and a scan… when can I get those done? And where? And… do I need to fast for the bloodwork? I always forget those things. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel a little better, even if it is still scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will have my assistant schedule the bloodwork and CT scan for you at the hospital across the street. You do need to fast for 12 hours prior to the bloodwork – no food or drinks except water. My assistant will provide you with specific instructions. The hospital will also contact you regarding payment options and financial assistance programs. It is best to call and confirm those details directly with them. As for the scan itself, you can take your usual medications unless I specifically instruct otherwise. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? I… I don't think so. I've never had a scan before. I don't know what contrast dye is. I’ve never really been sick enough to… need any of this. I’m allergic to… dust, I guess. And… pollen. But those aren't… serious allergies, right? It just makes me sneeze. I think. I really don’t know. Should I be worried about the dye?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good to know you have allergies to dust and pollen, but those are unlikely to interfere with the CT scan. The contrast dye is a liquid that helps us see the structures in your brain more clearly. A small percentage of people have allergic reactions to the dye, which is why it’s important to let us know about any allergies you have. Before the scan, the technician will ask you a series of questions to assess your risk. If you feel any itching, hives, or difficulty breathing during the scan, let them know immediately. It is rare to have a serious reaction. I'm going to write a referral for the scan and a lab order for the bloodwork. My assistant will coordinate everything for you. Once you have the results, you will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You've been very patient with me. I was getting really anxious there for a bit. Just… let me know if anything comes up. And I'll try to remember to fast. And… I'll call the hospital about the payment stuff. It's a lot to take in. I guess I'll… see you when I get the results.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. My assistant will be in touch shortly to schedule everything. Take care, and try not to worry too much. We will get to the bottom of this. Have a good day. .
