DOCTOR: Hi Candis, welcome. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's about this… weakness. And this strange habit I've developed. It's embarrassing, really. I just… feel tired all the time, and I keep wanting to eat dirt. Yes, dirt! Don’t look at me like that. It's awful, I know. It started a few months ago, and it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. No judgement here, I promise. It’s good you’re telling me about this, even if it is embarrassing. Feeling tired all the time and… the dirt craving… that’s definitely something we need to look into. Let’s start with the weakness. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things. I still go to work, you know, at the physical therapy place. But everything feels… heavy. Like I’m wading through mud. And it's not just physical. My brain feels foggy, too. It's hard to concentrate, hard to remember things... though I do remember this craving perfectly well, believe me. It's just… everything else is a bit… hazy. I used to be so sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s affecting both your physical energy and your mental clarity. And you've noticed a change from being sharper mentally in the past. That’s helpful to know. When did you first start noticing this…mud-like feeling and the fogginess?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was around… March, I believe. Right after that awful cold spell we had. I thought it was just the winter blues at first. Everyone gets a bit sluggish when it's gloomy, right? But it didn't lift when the weather warmed up. That’s when I started paying attention. And, of course, that's around when... the other thing started. Honestly, I’m just glad I haven't gotten sick from it.
DOCTOR: Okay, March… so about five months ago. And the dirt craving started around the same time as this fatigue and fogginess. You haven't experienced any stomach problems or other illness since starting to eat dirt?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No stomach aches, no… nothing like that. Just this constant craving. It’s not like I’m shoveling it down, you understand? It's more like… little bits. I find it outside, or sometimes in the garden… It’s just… soothing. Though I know it shouldn't be. It’s ridiculous, I tell you. Really, utterly ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, so small amounts, and it feels… soothing. That’s interesting. Do you find it’s a particular type of dirt, or just any dirt will do?
PATIENT: Oh, it has to be a certain kind. Not just any old dirt! It can't be sandy, definitely not. And it has to be… reddish. Clay-like, you know? The kind that feels smooth in your mouth. It sounds awful when I say it out loud. And please, don't make me explain this to anyone. I’m already embarrassed enough.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. Your privacy is very important to me. We're just figuring things out here. Reddish, clay-like dirt… okay. That's a very specific craving. Now, let's switch gears a little. Have you noticed any other changes in your body, like changes in your appetite, weight loss or gain, or any unusual bowel movements?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I haven’t been eating much lately. Food just doesn't seem appealing. And I suppose I’ve lost a little weight. My clothes are a bit looser. I hadn’t really paid attention. I'm not one for obsessing over such things. And no, no trouble with… that department. Everything’s… regular. If you must know.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, things like that. Nothing serious. And a hysterectomy, oh, must be thirty years ago now. But that's it. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Until… this. I don't even want to think about what this is. It's so… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses and a hysterectomy thirty years ago. And generally healthy until recently. Have you had any surgeries besides the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the hysterectomy. And a few fillings, if you count those! Honestly, Dr. Amussen, are you going to ask me about every little thing? This is taking forever. I have errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m taking up too much time, Candis. I just want to get a full picture. It helps me figure out what’s going on. And yes, I’m being thorough. Okay, how about family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. And my father… he just died of old age, really. Nothing specific. They weren’t the healthiest of people, truthfully. Smoked too much, drank too much… I always took good care of myself, you know? That's why this is so baffling.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and your father passed away from old age. Nothing else significant. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Let the body heal itself. That’s always been my philosophy. Except, of course, for this… this craving. I wish I could just stop it. It’s so embarrassing to even talk about. Are we getting anywhere with this? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never. I've always been very careful about my health. Clean living, that's me. Always have been. I can't even stand the smell of cigarette smoke. Honestly, Dr. Amussen, I’m a very respectable woman. This… craving is the only thing that's ever been… questionable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol, no smoking, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. Now, Candis, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just routine things - listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a lot to do today, you know. And please, don’t ask me about the dirt again. It's humiliating enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me… Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 100/60. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Throat looks fine. I’m also going to quickly check your extremities for any swelling or… unusual skin findings. Skin is normal, no swelling. I'm also going to check your nails. Sometimes nail changes can indicate deficiencies… Your nails are a bit brittle and… slightly spoon-shaped. That’s called koilonychia. It can be a sign of iron deficiency, among other things.
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? Oh, for goodness sake. I eat perfectly well! Mostly. I just haven’t been very hungry lately. And honestly, Dr. Amussen, what does my iron have to do with… this? It's embarrassing enough talking about eating dirt without being accused of… of being anemic! I suppose I should have mentioned I haven't been eating much red meat, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, less red meat. That is helpful to know. The spoon-shaped nails, combined with the decreased appetite and the… unusual craving, makes me suspect iron deficiency anemia might be a possibility. The craving for dirt—a condition called pica—can sometimes be a sign of that, as the body is trying to get nutrients it's missing. However, we need to confirm that with some blood tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a few other tests just to be sure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But if it isn't iron deficiency, I don’t know what I’m going to do. This is… beyond ridiculous. I just want to feel normal again. And I’d like to know if these tests are going to cost me a fortune. I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candis. We’ll keep the testing as focused as possible. I’ll have the lab check the cost before they run anything, and we can discuss it. There are also some assistance programs we can look into. We'll figure it out. Okay, I'm writing the lab order now. It will take about an hour or so to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you try to increase your iron intake with diet if possible. Lean meats, leafy green vegetables, fortified cereals… things like that. But don’t push yourself if you don’t have an appetite. And, Candis, try to avoid eating dirt until we know what’s going on. I know it’s difficult, but it’s best to rule out any potential contaminants or infections. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get me the results. And tell the lab to be gentle with the bill. Honestly, this whole thing is just… humiliating. I've never been so embarrassed in my life. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Candis, you can go. Here’s the lab order. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll take your blood sample and we’ll get the results back as soon as they're available. My nurse will call you with the results, probably by tomorrow afternoon. I understand this is embarrassing, but you did the right thing by coming in. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And we'll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, Candis. And please, try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. If you’ll excuse me. Dirt. Honestly. Who gets cravings for dirt?
