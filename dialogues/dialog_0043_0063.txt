DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really bad. It hurts all the time, but especially when I… when I move. It’s been getting worse for a few weeks now. And… well, you probably know, I had cancer before. That’s why I’m worried.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Meigs. It’s completely understandable to be worried, especially with your history. We’ll certainly take that into consideration as we figure out what’s going on. When you say it’s been getting worse for a few weeks, can you tell me a little more about how it’s changed?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… at first it was just a little ache, you know? Like after I’d been standing a long time at work. But now… now it’s sharp. Like someone is sticking me with a needle. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Not all the way, but… halfway down. And it’s harder to… to bend over. I used to be able to pick things up no problem, but now… I have to really think about it. And I've been sleeping bad. It's hard to get comfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Ms. Meigs. That gives me a much better picture. The sharp pain radiating down your leg is particularly important to note. Just to be thorough, can you tell me where exactly on your back is the pain located?
PATIENT: It’s… right here. . Not right in the middle, but… over here. And it feels like it goes into my hip a little bit too. It’s hard to say exactly… it kinda spreads around. But that’s where it starts, I think. And like I said, it shoots down my left leg. Not my right leg. Just the left.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's very helpful. And you mentioned it affects your sleep. Does anything specifically make the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. . Okay. Sitting for too long is bad. Really bad. And bending over, like I said. But… lying down flat doesn’t help much either. It’s kinda hard to get comfortable no matter what. Sometimes, if I walk around a little bit, it feels a little better. Just for a little while. And… a hot shower helps some. Not a lot, but it takes the edge off for maybe… ten minutes? That's about it. I haven't found anything that really makes it better for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prolonged sitting and bending worsen it, lying flat doesn’t provide relief, and walking and a hot shower offer temporary, limited improvement. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. You mentioned you had cancer before. Could you tell me what type of cancer it was, and when you were treated?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Okay. It was… leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia, the doctor said. It was… about five years ago. I had chemo, and then a stem cell transplant. It was… hard. But they said it was gone after that. I’ve been going for check-ups ever since. They always do blood tests, and everything has been okay. Until now, I guess. That's why I’m so worried it might be back, or something new.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Meigs, especially given your history with leukemia. It's good that you've been diligent with your check-ups and that everything has been clear until recently. We'll definitely keep that in mind as we investigate this back pain. Have you had any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago, but I lost some weight and it went away. I don’t have diabetes. And… no arthritis or anything like that. I've been pretty healthy, besides the leukemia. That was… a long time ago, though. I try to eat good, and I walk when I can. But… this back pain is making it hard to do anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. It’s not every day, though. Just when it gets high. The doctor gave it to me, just in case. It's called… amlodipine, I think. And… that’s it. I don’t take anything else regularly. Just that, when I need it. Maybe once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine as needed for blood pressure. Thank you. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your work and daily activities?
PATIENT: Okay. I work at the fish plant. We… we clean and pack the fish. Mostly tuna and mahi-mahi. It’s a lot of standing. And… a lot of bending and lifting. It’s not easy work. I’ve been doing it for… almost ten years now. Before that, I was a waitress, but that was worse on my feet. This is… hard on my back, though. And… I live alone. Mostly I just go to work, and come home. I try to see my grandkids sometimes, but it’s hard to get around with this pain.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Meigs. That gives me a good understanding of your daily routine and the physical demands of your job. Alright. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination of your back and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Ms. Meigs, I’m going to gently palpate, or feel, your back to assess for tenderness and muscle spasm. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, and how does that feel?
PATIENT: Ouch! That… that’s really sore. Right there. It hurts when you push on it. Not like a sharp pain, but… a deep ache. And… it kinda radiates down my leg a little bit when you press there. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That tenderness is consistent with muscle strain or potential nerve irritation. Now, I'm going to assess your range of motion. I’d like you to gently bend forward, backward, and to each side, as comfortably as you can. Please stop if you feel any significant pain. Alright, and how did those movements feel?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s hard. It hurts to bend forward. Not terrible, but… uncomfortable. And… it’s harder to bend to the left side. That’s… really stiff. And it hurts more on that side. It’s like something is blocking me. Backward isn't so bad, but… still uncomfortable. It feels like I can't move freely.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That is helpful. Now I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please lie flat on your back. Okay, and how does that feel?
PATIENT: The reflexes… they feel okay. Normal, I think. The strength… it feels a little weak on my left leg. Not a lot, but… weaker than my right leg. When you ask me to push back, it’s harder to do on that side. I’m trying, but it doesn’t feel as strong. Like it’s… tired.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. I've completed the physical exam. Based on the tenderness, limited range of motion, and slight weakness in your left leg, it’s likely you’re experiencing a lumbar strain with possible nerve impingement. However, given your history of leukemia, we need to be thorough and rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some imaging studies, specifically an MRI of your lumbar spine, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I will also order some blood tests to monitor your overall health and rule out any signs of recurrence of your previous condition. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds good. If that’s what you think is best. I want to know what’s wrong. An MRI and blood tests… yes, that’s fine. I trust you, Doctor. When will I get the results? And… will it hurt? The MRI, I mean.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel comfortable with that plan. The MRI itself is a painless procedure, Ms. Meigs. You’ll lie on a table, and a strong magnet and radio waves will create detailed images of your spine. It can be a little loud, so we’ll provide you with earplugs. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, I anticipate they’ll be available within 3-5 business days. Once I have them, I’ll call you immediately to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. You can also apply ice or heat to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activities that worsen your pain. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. I can handle that. Ibuprofen… yes, I have some of that. And ice and heat. I can do that. Um… will the MRI show if the cancer is back? That’s what I’m most worried about. And… if it is, what happens then?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Meigs, and I understand your anxiety. The MRI will help us assess the overall health of your spine and identify any abnormalities. While it can detect signs of cancer recurrence, it's important to remember that many other conditions can cause similar findings. If the MRI does reveal any suspicious areas, we’ll need to perform further investigations, such as a biopsy, to determine the exact cause. If it turns out to be a recurrence of your leukemia, we would immediately consult with an oncologist to discuss the best course of treatment, which may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a stem cell transplant, depending on the specifics of your case. However, I want to emphasize that it’s also very possible that this pain is due to a simple musculoskeletal issue, such as a muscle strain or a herniated disc, and has nothing to do with your previous cancer. We’ll have a clearer picture once we have the MRI results. For now, let's focus on managing your pain and getting you comfortable. I’m here to support you every step of the way, and we'll address any concerns as they arise. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. That… makes me feel a little better. A little. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not… rushing me. I really appreciate that. I'll call if I have any questions, okay? And I'll schedule the MRI. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns at all. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll have my nurse schedule the MRI for you and provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare. Have a good day, and I look forward to hearing from you after the results are available. .
