DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Shely, you say? A… a perfectly adequate name, I suppose. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s a… a bit of a… discharge. Yes. A discharge. Down there. I haven't had this problem in… well, a long time. A very long time. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It sounds concerning, and you’re right to seek medical attention. It’s perfectly alright to feel embarrassed discussing personal matters, that’s what I’m here for. Could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: A little more? Hmm. Let me see… It’s… not a large amount, thankfully. More of a… a dampness, really. And it’s… yellowish, I believe. Or perhaps greenish? Honestly, the colors all seem rather… murky to an old man like myself. It doesn't hurt, per se, but it's… irritating. And my wife… well, she noticed. She’s always noticing things, you see. A very perceptive woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krok. It’s helpful to have those details. So, it’s a yellowish-greenish discharge, not a large amount, more of a dampness, and not painful, but irritating. And your wife has observed it as well. Could you tell me approximately when you first noticed this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When did I first notice it? That’s… difficult. Time does rather slip away, doesn’t it? Let me think… It’s been… a week? Perhaps ten days? I had been tending to the Massey Ferguson, you see, quite a bit of work with the hydraulics… and then I noticed it. Or perhaps it was after I finished with the baler… No, no, it must have been around the time of the garden party. My wife’s garden party. A rather grand affair, though I don’t much care for socializing. It was… definitely after the strawberries were picked. Yes, that helps narrow it down, doesn’t it? Around the strawberries, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Krok. Around ten days, coinciding with the garden and strawberry picking. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me consider… Well, I have been feeling a bit… tired lately. But then again, I’m eighty-three years old! One expects a certain amount of tiredness, doesn't one? No, that’s not relevant, I suppose. And… my waterworks haven’t been quite as… forceful, shall we say. A bit of a dribble, if I’m honest. And occasionally… a bit of burning. A slight stinging, when… well, you know. But it comes and goes. It’s probably just… old age. Everything is starting to…sag, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krok. So, along with the discharge, you've noticed some fatigue, a decreased urinary stream, and occasional burning with urination. Those are important details. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… a rather lengthy affair, that. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, a long time ago. They put me on a little pill for that. Still take it, I believe. And…arthritis, of course. Every old man has arthritis! And…I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up. As for diabetes… I don't think so. The doctor never said anything about diabetes. Although my wife does worry about my sugar intake. She’s always saying I have too many baklava. A perfectly delicious pastry, baklava. I don’t recall any kidney problems, no.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. So, a history of high blood pressure managed with medication, arthritis, and a previous episode of pneumonia. No known history of diabetes or kidney problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me rack my brain. There was… a hernia operation, many years ago. When I was still a young man, strong as an ox. They fixed me right up. And… I had my appendix out, when I was a boy. A nasty business, that. Other than that… I don't believe so. Perhaps a few minor things, but nothing significant. Nothing that would be relevant, I’m sure. My wife would probably remember more accurately. She has a… remarkable memory for such things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. So, a history of hernia repair and appendectomy. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Besides the little pink pill for the blood pressure… Ah, yes. I take something for my arthritis. A small white tablet. And… sometimes, when my joints are particularly troublesome, I take a stronger painkiller. A yellow one. My wife keeps track of all these things, you see. She makes a little chart. I simply take what she gives me. It’s much easier that way. I don't want to mess things up. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krok. So, medication for blood pressure, arthritis, and occasionally a stronger pain reliever as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not that I recall, anyway. Perhaps a slight sniffle when the pollen is bad, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? My wife is always warning me about shellfish, but I’ve eaten shellfish all my life without any problems. She worries too much, that woman. Still, better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. No, I don't have any allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Thank you for answering all of those questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam, you say? Hmm. Very well. I suppose it’s necessary. Though I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded. But if it will help determine the cause of this… affliction, then I acquiesce. Just… be gentle, Doctor. I’m an old man, you see. Everything is a bit… fragile.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll need to examine your abdomen, and finally, I’ll need to take a urine sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Urine sample, you say? Now you're talking about poking and prodding! That’s… rather unpleasant, isn’t it? Still, I suppose I must cooperate. It’s all part of the process, isn’t it? Very well, Doctor. But please, be discreet. It’s rather embarrassing, this whole affair. And… where exactly do I… provide the sample?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns, and I will ensure your privacy. There’s a restroom just down the hall. I’ll provide you with a sterile cup, and you can collect the sample there. I’ll give you a moment of privacy. Once you’ve collected the sample, just leave it on the counter, and I’ll collect it. Before you go, let me listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you to collect the urine sample. Please just knock when you are finished.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A quick listen, you say? Good. The sooner this is over, the better. [A brief pause as I subtly adjust my trousers] [I slowly rise from the chair, a bit creaky and unsteady] I shall endeavor to provide a… satisfactory sample. And I will knock. Though I doubt I’ll have much to offer, if I’m honest. [I shuffle towards the restroom door]
