DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Shely, is it? Fancy name. Well, honestly, I don’t rightly know why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed to be “checked out.” I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Though these feet… always a bother, you know? Been a podiatrist for… well, a long time. Long enough to know when something's really wrong, and it ain’t now.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your daughter is concerned and brought you in for a general check-up, despite you feeling well. That’s very thoughtful of her. And you’ve had a long career as a podiatrist – that’s quite impressive! Knowing your own body so well is certainly valuable. Let's start with a bit more detail then. Even though you feel "perfectly fine," could you tell me about any changes you have noticed recently, however small?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmmm… well, everything feels a bit… slower, I suppose. Not painful, just… takes a bit longer to get going in the mornings. And I forget things, you know? Names mostly. Faces too, sometimes. Though, at my age, that’s to be expected, isn’t it? Don’t go thinking I'm losing my marbles, young lady. I still know a good bunion when I see one.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Gunasekara. Forgetting names occasionally is perfectly normal, especially as we get older. And feeling a bit slower in the mornings is also common. We just want to make sure everything is as it should be. Could you tell me a little more about this slowness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things, you understand. I still manage the garden, though it takes me longer to weed. And I still cook – though my daughter keeps telling me I use too much salt. She worries about everything. But getting started... that's the hard part. Like there's a bit of rust in the joints, you know? Not pain, just… resistance. And I used to be able to just jump up and go. Now I have to… ease into it. It's annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s not a sharp pain, but more of a stiffness or resistance when you begin activities, requiring a bit more effort to get moving. And it’s been gradual, not a sudden change?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Gradual. That's a good word for it. It didn’t just happen one day. It just… crept up on me. Like the tide coming in, you don’t notice it at first. And it’s mostly in the mornings, like I said. By afternoon, I’m usually alright. I still get around. Still putter. Though I haven’t worn heels in… oh, goodness, decades. Not since before my divorce, probably. Though, to be honest, I don't recall much about that time.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Gunasekara. The fact that it’s worse in the mornings and improves throughout the day is a useful clue. And you mentioned difficulty recalling events from a certain period… is that a recent development, or has that been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, it’s been years, dear. The memory… it comes and goes. Certain things are crystal clear, like my training. I could tell you all about Dr. Moreau, my mentor. Brilliant man. But things like… birthdays, anniversaries, what I had for lunch last week… gone. My daughter says it’s a sign of… something. She uses fancy words. It's just… frustrating. I used to have such a sharp mind.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve experienced some memory changes over time, with certain memories remaining vivid while others are more difficult to recall. It’s understandable that’s frustrating, especially given your professional background and sharp intellect. To get a better picture of your overall health, would you mind answering a few questions about other areas?
PATIENT: Oh, more questions? Honestly, I feel like I'm back in medical school! Go on, dear. Get it over with. Just try not to use too many fancy words, alright? My brain feels a bit… tired.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. I'll keep it simple. Let's start with your sleep. On average, how many hours of sleep do you get each night?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, that varies. Some nights I sleep like a log, others I’m up and down like a yo-yo. Probably… six, seven hours? On a good night. I don’t really need much sleep. Always been that way. I used to say sleep was for the weak! Though, now… well, now sometimes I wake up and just lie there. Staring at the ceiling. Thinking. Or trying to.
DOCTOR: I see. So, generally six to seven hours, but with some nights being better than others, and occasionally some trouble falling asleep. Do you snore, or has anyone ever told you that you stop breathing while you sleep?
PATIENT: Snore? Oh, I’m sure I do. Most people do, don’t they? My… my late husband used to complain, bless his soul. Said it sounded like a freight train. He’d nudge me and I’d roll over. As for stopping breathing… I honestly don’t know. I’ve never been told. My daughter might know. She fusses over everything. She probably has a machine to measure it or something.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And your daughter’s concern is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. My diet. That's a sensitive topic. I like to eat. Always have. I make a good stew, you know. Lots of vegetables. And I like a bit of salt. My daughter is always nagging me about that. Honestly, a little salt never hurt anyone! I have toast for breakfast, usually. And a cup of coffee. Lunch is… whatever's left over. And dinner… well, depends. Sometimes stew. Sometimes fish. And I like a little something sweet afterwards. A biscuit. Or a piece of chocolate. Don't tell my daughter.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a varied diet with a preference for home-cooked meals, and a fondness for a little salt and something sweet. That sounds quite enjoyable, actually. Now, let’s move on to any current medications you’re taking, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. That's another thing my daughter keeps track of. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. And something for my cholesterol. Another little pill. Honestly, I can't remember the names. And I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor took me off it. Said it wasn't helping. That was years ago. My daughter has a list, dear. A very long list, I suspect.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, medication for blood pressure and cholesterol, and you previously took something for arthritis. We can certainly review that list with your daughter to ensure everything is accurate. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. To medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmmm… not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to garden a lot, you know, and I was always sticking my hands in the dirt. Never had any trouble. My daughter asked me about bee stings once, but I don't recall ever being stung. Honestly, I don't think I have any allergies. Lucky me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Gunasekara. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, lord. Where do I even begin? I've lived a long life, dear. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was in my twenties. Spent a week in the hospital. Other than that… I had a hysterectomy many years ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. A silly accident. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. My daughter has all the details, I'm sure. She keeps a very thorough record.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, childhood illnesses, tonsillectomy, pneumonia in your twenties, hysterectomy, and a broken wrist. We can certainly review that information with your daughter to ensure a complete record. And have you had any surgeries other than the hysterectomy and repair of your broken wrist?
PATIENT: Let me think…oh! I had a cataract removed from one eye, years ago. And I think… yes, I had a polyp removed during a colonoscopy. A routine thing, the doctor said. Nothing to worry about. And… that's all I can think of right now. My brain feels a bit… overloaded. Honestly, I’m a bit tired.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Gunasekara. You've had a full life, and it's a lot to recall. So, cataract removal, colonoscopy with polyp removal. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. That's another thing my daughter is obsessed with. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart. A weak heart, maybe? He died young, actually. My brother… he had diabetes, I believe. But other than that… I don't really know. My family wasn't one for talking about these things. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. My daughter has all the details, dear. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, a family history of high blood pressure, heart condition, and diabetes. We can certainly review that information with your daughter to obtain a more detailed family history. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Oh, you mean... my life? Well, I was married for a long time. A very long time. But it didn't end well. I have a daughter, bless her heart, she's very good to me, even if she does fuss too much. I used to be very active in the community. Volunteered at the library. And I enjoyed gardening, as I mentioned. Now… I mostly stay home. Read a bit. Watch television. Not much excitement these days.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Gunasekara. A long marriage, a close relationship with your daughter, and a history of community involvement. That paints a lovely picture. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Go ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just be gentle, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be. And don't be surprised if I flinch. I’m a bit jumpy these days. Though I used to be a very steady hand, you know. A podiatrist needs a steady hand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And don't worry about flinching – it’s perfectly normal. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Everything seems relatively normal, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur warrant further investigation. I'll make a note of these findings.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that bad? My father had something with his heart, you know. I always worried about that. And my blood pressure… I don’t like the sound of “elevated.” Is that something serious? My daughter is going to be terribly worried. She always worries too much. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s natural to be worried when you hear things like “murmur” and “elevated blood pressure.” Let me explain. A heart murmur is simply an extra sound heard during a heartbeat. It doesn't always mean something is seriously wrong. Many murmurs are harmless, often described as “innocent murmurs.” However, since your father had heart issues, it’s important to investigate further to determine the cause of the murmur. We'll likely order an echocardiogram – a non-invasive ultrasound of the heart – to get a clearer picture. As for the elevated blood pressure, it’s slightly higher than the ideal range, but it's not drastically so. We’ll monitor it over time, and discuss lifestyle modifications – such as diet and exercise – that can help lower it. We may also consider medication if needed. It's important to remember that we are being proactive, taking steps to ensure your overall health. Your daughter’s concern is understandable, and we’ll keep her informed every step of the way. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Echocardiogram? More tests? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a guinea pig. And medication… I don't like the sound of that either. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I always preferred natural remedies, you know. A good cup of chamomile tea. That used to cure everything. And my daughter… she's going to be insufferable. She’ll want to schedule every test under the sun. She’ll hover over me, making sure I take my pills, checking my blood pressure every five minutes. Honestly, it’s exhausting. Is this… is this serious? Will I need to change my life completely? I just want to live out my days in peace, you know. Gardening, reading, watching television. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings completely, Ms. Gunasekara. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious when faced with new tests and the possibility of medication. It sounds like you're very concerned about maintaining your independence and quality of life, and that's a very valid concern. Let me reassure you that we're not jumping to any conclusions. The echocardiogram is simply a tool to gather more information, allowing us to determine the best course of action. It’s a painless, non-invasive procedure. And medication isn't always necessary. We'll discuss all your options, and together, we’ll create a plan that suits your needs and preferences. We can explore lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress reduction – as a first step. As for your daughter, I understand her concern is likely stemming from a place of love and care. We can work with her to ensure she's providing support without being overbearing. To be honest, at your age, it is normal to have some changes in your body. The goal is not to completely overhaul your life, but to ensure you're healthy and able to enjoy the things you love. I believe we can address these concerns without making drastic changes. Would you be open to scheduling the echocardiogram?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. If you think it's necessary. But please, no drastic changes. I just want to live out my days in peace, you know? Gardening, reading, watching television. And please, talk to my daughter. She needs to understand that I don't want to be fussed over. She means well, but she can be… a bit much. Honestly, I’m tired. All this talk about tests and medications… it’s exhausting. And what about my feet? We haven't even talked about my feet! I've been a podiatrist for… well, a long time. I know a good bunion when I see one. Shouldn’t we at least check my feet? They’re probably the only thing still working properly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Gunasekara. You are absolutely right to bring up your feet! I apologize for not addressing them earlier. It’s important to me that we address all your concerns. And I promise, no drastic changes. We’ll take things one step at a time, and together we'll create a plan that works for you. I’ll speak with your daughter and explain the importance of respecting your wishes and allowing you to maintain your independence. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. So, to summarize, we’ll schedule an echocardiogram to get a clearer picture of your heart health. We’ll discuss the results and explore the best course of action together. We’ll also address your daughter’s concerns and ensure she’s providing support without being overbearing. And we’ll continue to monitor your blood pressure and address any concerns you may have. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That sounds… manageable. As long as you promise no drastic changes. And please, talk to my daughter. She'll want to schedule every test under the sun. Honestly, I’m tired. All this talk about tests and medications… it’s exhausting. Alright. Let’s get this echocardiogram over with, so I can get back to my garden. And thank you, dear. For listening. And for not telling me I need to completely change my life. You seem like a nice young woman. A bit too eager for tests, perhaps, but nice nonetheless. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a cup of chamomile tea. It always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Gunasekara. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could address your concerns. I will certainly speak with your daughter and explain my approach. And I promise, no drastic changes. I’ll have my assistant schedule the echocardiogram for you, and we’ll follow up with you once we have the results. In the meantime, please enjoy your chamomile tea. It sounds like just what you need. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And I wish you all the best with your garden. .
PATIENT: .
