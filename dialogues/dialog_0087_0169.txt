DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Soodeen, you say? Hmm. Well, it's my face and legs, mostly. They're... puffy. Been that way a bit now. Can't rightly say how long, to be honest. Time just slips away, you know? It's bothersome, I guess. Makes my boots feel tight.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Puffy” is a good way to describe it. And you said this has been going on for a “bit now.” Could you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… Oh, geez. Maybe… a month? Two? It's hard to say. Things just kinda… happen. Didn't pay it much mind at first, thought I just had a bad day standing. It didn't go away though. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… uncomfortable. Makes me feel sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or two. And no pain, just discomfort and a feeling of sluggishness. Have you noticed the puffiness getting worse over that time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: I reckon it’s gotten a little worse. Not dramatically, mind you. But my wife… well, she always noticed things. She'd say my ankles were looking like balloons. She's gone now, though. Been a few years. So, no one points these things out anymore. But yeah, a little worse, I'd say. Definitely tighter boots.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Miner. It sounds like your wife had a keen eye. Tighter boots and increased puffiness are certainly things we want to investigate. Besides your face and legs, have you noticed any swelling anywhere else?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just the legs and face. Maybe a little in my fingers sometimes, but I do a lot of work with my hands, you know? Welding and all. Could just be from that. I don't think it's anything to worry about. I've always been a pretty sturdy fella. Though, admittedly, I ain’t been as active lately. Still, I don't understand what's causing this swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned welding. Is there anything else about your work that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Relevant, you say? Hmm. Well, it's hot work, naturally. Lots of fumes, I suppose. Always have the fan going, try to keep things ventilated. And I'm on my feet all day, like I said. Lots of bending and reaching. I don’t really think it's the work, though. I’ve been doing it for forty years. Never had trouble before. Just this… puffiness. It’s new.
DOCTOR: Alright. And outside of work, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day? Well, not much to tell, really. I wake up, have some coffee. Read the paper, if there's anything interesting in it. Used to go fishing with my wife. Don’t do that much anymore. Now I mostly just sit around. Watch TV. Fix things around the house, if something breaks. Not much excitement. Quiet life. Too quiet, maybe. Eat my dinner, go to bed. Repeat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what does a typical meal look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, you know. Regular stuff. Coffee and a biscuit for breakfast. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe some soup. Dinner… well, whatever's easy. Frozen dinners sometimes. Meatloaf, mashed potatoes… that sort of thing. I don't really fuss with fancy cooking. Used to enjoy making Swedish meatballs with my wife. She was a wonderful cook. Now, it's just easier to keep things simple. Don’t bother much with vegetables, either. Not a big fan.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions. Let me see. The doctor always told me my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. But he said it wasn't anything to worry about, just to watch my salt intake. Never been told I had diabetes, though. And my heart… I've never had any problems with my heart, not that I know of. Always felt strong as an ox. Just this puffiness, now. Everything else has always been… fine. I don't go to the doctor much, to be honest. Don’t see the point unless something’s broken.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That was a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days once when I broke my arm falling off a ladder. Reckless youth, that was. Other than that… no, not really. Nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises. I’ve always been a pretty tough Swede, you see. Don't break easily. Not until getting old, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been much for pills. Don't like taking things I don't need. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. Don’t believe in relying on medicine too much. Let the body heal itself, that’s what I always say. Though, this puffiness… maybe I need a little help with that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have had any medical conditions, such as heart disease, kidney problems, or swelling in their legs or face?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my mother, she had a bad heart. Passed away when I was still young. And my father, he had high blood pressure, I think. My sister… she was always healthy as a horse. Never had a sick day in her life. As for swelling… now that you mention it, my wife's mother… she did have swollen legs towards the end. But that was years ago. Don’t rightly remember the details. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Lucky that way, I suppose. Never had a problem with allergies. Can eat anything, take anything. Though, I don't go out of my way to try new things, mind you. Stick to what I know. But allergies… no. Never had a one. Pretty good, considering. I guess I'm just a sturdy Swede.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Thank you for answering all of my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam, you say? Hmm. Alright, go ahead. Don't see why not. Just hope it doesn't take too long. Got a bit of a TV show I’m wanting to catch later. But yeah, go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Hah… there. Deep breath. Not as easy as it used to be, mind you. Used to be able to hold my breath for ages when I was younger. Underwater welding, that was. But that was a long time ago. There. Is that good enough? Anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound a little quiet at the bottom, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. Not alarmingly high, but something we'll need to keep an eye on. Now, I’m going to check your pulse in your feet. Your pulses are a little weak in your feet. Now, let's take a look at your legs and face. Could you please point to the areas where you’re experiencing the puffiness?
PATIENT: Right around here. Ankle feels tight in my boots. And here, shins. It's not painful, just… swollen. And my face, mostly around here. Gets a little puffy in the mornings. Not terrible, mind you. Just noticeable. My wife used to say I looked like a chipmunk. But she's gone now, so… it doesn't matter much.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do notice some swelling in your ankles, shins, and face. And when I press on the skin, it leaves a little indentation – that's called pitting edema. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen sounds normal. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little weaker than I’d like. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the exam, there are a few things that could be causing your symptoms. I want to order some blood and urine tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood and urine tests, you say? Hmm. Alright, go ahead. Don't love needles, but if it'll figure out what's wrong, I suppose I can handle it. Just try to be quick, alright? And don't poke too much. I bruise easily these days. So, what do you think it could be? Is it serious? Don't tell me if it's something bad, mind you. I don’t need any more worries.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. As for what it could be, there are a few possibilities. The swelling in your legs and face, along with your elevated blood pressure and weakened reflexes, could be a sign of several things, including fluid retention, kidney problems, or even early signs of heart failure. But it's too early to say for sure. That's why the blood and urine tests are so important. They'll help us rule out some of these possibilities and get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'll also order an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity. I understand you don’t want to worry, and I won’t jump to any conclusions. We'll take things one step at a time. Once we have the test results, we'll discuss them and come up with a plan together. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Nah, don’t bother with the details. Just tell me what I need to do. Blood, urine, and… what was it? EKG? Alright, fine. Just get it over with. And try to be quick, alright? I got a TV show I’m wanting to catch later. And tell me where to go to get these tests done. It’s just a lot to take in, you know? Things just aren’t as easy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. You don't need to worry about the details. I’ll write you a lab order for the blood tests, urine test, and EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and the EKG technician is right next door. They’re both very efficient. Once you've had the tests done, the results will be sent to me, and I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It should take a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results, alright? I don’t like being in the dark. And if it’s something bad… well, just tell me straight. I’m an old man, I can handle it. My wife… she always took care of these things. It’s just… harder now without her. Alright. I guess I’ll go get these tests done. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Miner. I’ll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I understand this is difficult, and I’m here to help in any way I can. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
