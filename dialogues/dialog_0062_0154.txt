DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… the waterworks, really. Been botherin’ me again. It’s… a repeat thing, you see. A bad repeat. I don’t… I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. Just… happens. I’d like to get it sorted, if possible. Quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, “the waterworks” – I understand. So it sounds like you're experiencing some issues with urination. And you said it's been happening again, a repeat issue. That’s helpful to know. When you say it “happens,” can you tell me a little more about how it happens?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s… a burnin’ feeling, mostly. When I… go. And then I feel like I have to go right away, even when I just went. It’s uncomfortable, very uncomfortable. And sometimes… a little bit of… a trickle after. I don’t know if that makes sense. It just… comes and goes. Mostly comes, these days. Honestly, it’s been a bother for… a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a burning sensation during urination, a feeling of urgency even after emptying your bladder, and some leakage afterward. That definitely sounds bothersome. It's good you're describing everything, even the “trickle.” And when you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while… that’s a difficult one. Years, I suppose. Not constantly, you understand. It comes and goes in spells. But… maybe three years? Four? It’s hard to keep track, Doctor. I’ve had so many things on my mind. And it’s never been… this bad before, not for this long, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so three to four years on and off, but it’s been worse recently and more persistent. I understand it’s hard to keep track, especially with other things going on. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes… a little ache in my lower tummy. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. And I get tired, very tired. But I thought that was just… old age. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know if that’s related or not. And… sometimes my water is a little cloudy. Not always, but sometimes. It's just... hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your lower abdomen, increased fatigue, and occasionally cloudy urine. Those are all things to consider. It’s good you're telling me everything, even if you're not sure if it’s related. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now, that’s a question. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And… I had a bit of trouble with my heart, a long time back, but it sorted itself out. Mostly. I don't recall much else. I’ve been to the doctor for… the usual things, you know. Colds, the flu. But nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Claudene. It’s perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. Gallbladder removal and a history of heart trouble are good to know. Do you remember what kind of heart trouble it was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re askin’ too much, Doctor. It was… palpitations, I think? My heart would race and flutter. The doctor put me on some pills for a while, and it… settled down. I stopped takin’ the pills after a while, with the doctor’s permission, of course. It hasn’t bothered me for… oh, twenty years, maybe more? I honestly can’t recall the details. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t paying much attention to the specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations treated with medication many years ago, and currently not experiencing any heart issues. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago. When I was still… younger. That’s about it, I think. No, I'm quite sure. Nothing else springs to mind. Honestly, Doctor, I’m trying my best, but my memory is… patchy. I apologize for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Claudene. A hysterectomy is good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family... Now that's a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had some trouble with his kidneys, a long time ago. But he drank too much, so it’s hard to say if that was the cause. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a very close family, so I don't know much about their health. They’re all… gone now, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and kidney trouble – potentially related to alcohol use. That’s helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a dreadful habit. My late husband… he smoked for a while, but he gave it up, thank goodness. It's bad for you, you know.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. Just one. Occasionally two, if it's a special occasion. Nothing excessive, Doctor, I assure you. I'm not a big drinker. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine consumption, not excessive. That’s good to know. Now, I’m going to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take a little bit of calcium for my bones. And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my arthritis, when it’s botherin’ me. Just ibuprofen, over the counter. That’s about it, I think. I don't like takin' pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, calcium for your bones and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've been pretty lucky, I suppose. I don’t recall ever being allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, Claudene, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam. Yes, alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. Quickly, if possible, please. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your abdomen. And finally, I’ll do a quick neurological check. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m checking your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh… a little bit there, yes. Lower down, on the right side. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s been a bit achy lately, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild tenderness in the lower right abdomen. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I’m concerned about a possible urinary tract infection, or UTI, and we need to rule out other possibilities. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a urine test – a urinalysis. It will check for infection and other abnormalities. I'd also like a basic metabolic panel to check kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine test. Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. And… the other test. Quickly, please, Doctor. I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll order both tests right away. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a urine sample and draw some blood. It should only take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, is there anything else you’d like to discuss, or any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing that you haven’t mentioned?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. Just… get it sorted quickly, if possible. I'm not a fan of hospitals or tests. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll do our best to get the results back as quickly as possible. Okay, Claudene. The nurse will be in shortly. I'll review the results as soon as they are available and discuss them with you. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, dear. That will be all. Thank you for your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’ll see you shortly. .
