DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Right. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and…hungry, too. More so than usual, I suppose. It’s just…constant. It’s a bit bothersome, to be honest, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Constant thirst and increased hunger can certainly be bothersome. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It’s been… a few weeks, I’d say. Maybe a month? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase. I initially just thought I was perhaps not drinking enough, but I’ve been making a point of drinking plenty, and it hasn't really helped.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset over the past month. And you said the increased thirst and hunger are present even when you're consciously trying to drink more fluids?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. I'm regularly having water, and sometimes juice, throughout the day, more than I usually would. And I still feel… parched. And I’ll eat a good meal, feel satisfied for a bit, then within a couple of hours I’m feeling hungry again. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I've not changed my diet recently, either.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good information. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me consider. I’ve been… going to the lavatory a bit more often, if that makes sense. And, now that you mention it, I feel quite tired. Just… generally fatigued, even after a good night's sleep. Nothing drastic, but noticeable. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's relevant. Increased urination and fatigue are definitely things we need to explore further. Can you tell me a little more about the increased urination?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it's not a massive change, but I'm finding I'm needing to go to the toilet more frequently than I used to. Especially at night, which is a bit annoying, to be frank. I'd say I'm up at least once, sometimes twice, during the night now, where I wasn’t before. It’s not painful, just… more frequent. A full bladder sensation comes on quickly, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, nocturia—needing to urinate at night—and a feeling of urgency. Let's move on to a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing diagnosed. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, needed physiotherapy for it, but that's resolved now. Otherwise, I'm generally quite healthy, I believe. I haven't been to the doctor in… well, a while, to be honest. Just the usual check-ups, nothing serious. I don't take any regular medication, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses or regular medications. And your back issue is resolved. Now, have there been any significant changes in your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tougher one. My mother had… something with her stomach, I think. She was diagnosed quite late in life, though, and I wasn't really involved in the details. And my father… he had heart problems, but again, that was later in life. Neither of them had… what you’re thinking of, I assume? Diabetes, perhaps? No, I don't believe so. It wasn’t really discussed much, to be frank. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it's not always easy to recall family medical history. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never been a smoker. Never had the inclination, thankfully. And I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner now and then, perhaps a pint with friends on a weekend. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I try to stay active, too. I do a bit of gardening, and I walk the dog most days. Nothing strenuous, but it keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, so non-smoker, moderate alcohol consumption, and regular light exercise. Lastly regarding your social history, do you have any major sources of stress in your life currently?
PATIENT: Stress… well, yes, actually. My divorce was finalised about six months ago. It’s been… difficult, to say the least. Sorting everything out, financially and otherwise. It’s settled now, as much as it can be, but it’s left me… a bit unsettled, I suppose. It’s occupying my mind quite a lot. Does that count as stress, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Christen, that definitely counts as stress. A major life change like a divorce can absolutely contribute to physical symptoms. Okay, to help narrow down what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I’m happy to cooperate. I just… I’d like to get this sorted out, if possible. I'm a busy man, and I'd prefer to be back at work as soon as I can. No offence intended, of course.
DOCTOR: None taken at all, I understand. Alright. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 135/85, and your pulse is 88. Within normal limits, but slightly elevated. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your weight. You weigh 93 kilograms, and your height is 170 centimetres. That gives you a BMI of 32.3, which is in the obese range. Finally, I'm going to do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation. Your reflexes are normal, and your sensation is intact. Everything seems to be within normal limits physically, but given your symptoms of increased thirst, hunger, and urination, and your slightly elevated BMI, I think it’s important to run some blood tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then yes, absolutely. Blood tests are fine. I suppose the weight… I’ve always carried a bit of extra, to be frank. But if it’s contributing to this, then so be it. Let’s get it checked. What sort of tests are you thinking of? And how long will it take to get the results? I have commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, which will check your blood glucose levels, kidney function, and electrolytes. We'll also do a HbA1c test to get an average of your blood sugar over the past few months, and a complete blood count. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us determine if diabetes is a possibility, as well as rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. The lab work typically takes 24-48 hours for results to come back. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water, but try to limit sugary drinks. Is there anything I can answer for you before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I believe that's everything for now, Doctor. 24-48 hours is… acceptable. I'll refrain from sugary drinks, as you suggest. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Just get me back to normal, if possible. Where do I go for the blood tests? And do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. We'll do our best to get you back to normal. The lab is just down the hall to your left, room 203. Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I'll send the lab requisition order electronically to them now, and they’ll be expecting you. The receptionist can assist you with any scheduling questions. Once the results are back, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. Fasting for 8-12 hours... noted. Thank you again, Doctor Lahn, for your time and assistance. I appreciate your thoroughness. I shall see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. Get well, and I’ll see you soon.
