DOCTOR: Hi Westly, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been going to the restroom… quite a lot lately. More than usual, I suppose. It’s a bit bothersome, really. I don't quite recall when it started, but it’s been going on for some time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be bothersome. “Some time now” is a little vague – would you say it’s been a few weeks, a few months, or longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me see… months, I believe. Perhaps three, four months? It’s difficult to be precise, you understand. My memory isn't what it used to be. It hasn't been a sudden change, more of a… gradual increase, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, thank you for clarifying. A gradual increase is helpful to know. And is it just frequency – needing to go more often – or are you also experiencing urgency – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: Yes… urgency, that’s a good way to put it. Sometimes it comes on rather suddenly. Not always, but frequently enough to be… inconvenient. I wouldn't say it's painful, thankfully. Just… a strong and immediate need. It's certainly disrupting my routine a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency and urgency, without pain. That's good information. Are you noticing any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me see… I don't believe so. It looks normal, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a bit… paler than usual, now that you mention it. But honestly, I don’t pay terribly close attention to such things. I suppose it's difficult for me to say with any certainty.
DOCTOR: Alright, no noticeable changes to the color, just a bit paler perhaps. Have you been drinking more fluids than usual lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. In fact, if anything, I’ve been trying to reduce my fluid intake, hoping to… well, alleviate the problem. It doesn't seem to be helping much, though. I've always been a moderate drinker – a cup of coffee with breakfast, perhaps a glass of water throughout the day. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no increase in fluid intake, and you've even tried reducing it. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower back pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And thankfully, no back pain. I haven't felt unwell in any other way, really. Just this… constant need to visit the restroom. It's more of a nuisance than anything, but it is becoming rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No other symptoms like fever, chills, or back pain. Just the frequent and urgent urination. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or prostate problems, that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. That’s a name I’ve heard, of course. I don’t believe I’ve been diagnosed with it, no. As for… prostate problems… that’s a bit of a sensitive subject, Doctor. I've had some… age-related issues, let’s say. A friend of mine had some troubles with his prostate, and I’ve noticed a slight difficulty with… urination flow at times. But it’s not severe, and I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly, but nothing major has come up.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being open with me. It's good you've been seeing a doctor regularly. So, some age-related urinary issues, and a history of seeing a doctor, but no formal diagnoses of diabetes or prostate problems. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam, and then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh. Well. I suppose… if it’s necessary. I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of such procedures. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you believe it's required to determine the cause of this… issue, then I will comply. Please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Westly. I understand your apprehension, and I assure you, I’ll be as gentle as possible. It's a quick exam, and it will provide valuable information. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then your heart and lungs. Then, I'll need you to lie on your side, and I'll perform the digital rectal exam. After that, we can discuss the results and potential next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Please, proceed at your own pace. I trust your expertise. And… perhaps a warning before the… rectal exam would be appreciated. Just so I am prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual noises. Your heart and lungs sound good as well. Now, Westly, just so you know, for the rectal exam, I'll be wearing a gloved and lubricated finger to gently assess your prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the exam. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I believe so. Please, proceed. Quickly, if you wouldn't mind. And… thank you for the explanation. It does… help a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, Westly. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of significant tenderness. It’s not alarmingly large, but the enlargement could be contributing to your urinary symptoms. Based on the exam and your history, it's likely we're dealing with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH – an enlarged prostate. This is very common in men your age. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The PSA test will help us assess your prostate-specific antigen levels, which can indicate inflammation or potential cancer, though BPH can also raise the PSA. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Benign… something? An enlarged prostate… well, that’s… less frightening than I imagined, frankly. A blood test and urine analysis… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I want to be thorough, of course. And if you think it’s necessary, I’ll gladly provide a sample. Although, I may need a moment to… locate the facilities.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take your time. The restroom is just down the hall to the left. When you're ready, just let the nurse know, and we’ll get the samples sent to the lab. While you're doing that, I’ll write up the orders for the tests. We can discuss the results when they come back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, try to avoid excessive fluid intake before bed to minimize nighttime trips to the restroom. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… quite sensible. Avoid fluids before bed. I can certainly manage that. Thank you for your thoroughness and… your patience. I’ll be back shortly with the sample.
DOCTOR: Okay, Westly. Take your time. I’ll be here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I apologize for the delay. It seems I'm not as nimble as I once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Westly. Take your time is the most important thing. Alright, I'll send this off to the lab along with the blood test order. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please call the office immediately. Otherwise, we’ll discuss the results when they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness and… your explanations. It’s reassuring to know what’s likely happening. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Westly. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. We'll get those results back to you as soon as possible. Here's a copy of the summary for your records, and the clinic's contact information if you have any questions. Have a good day, Westly, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor DeCosta. You’ve been most helpful. Good day to you as well.
