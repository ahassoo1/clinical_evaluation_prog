DOCTOR: Right. Mackenzi Brightful, 29 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Dechêne, is it? Yes, that’s right. Well, it’s… about a surgery. I’m hoping to get some clearance for it. It’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. It’s not something I’ve talked about much, and my memory… isn't what it used to be. But I do know I need to be properly checked before going ahead with it.
DOCTOR: A surgery… right. And you’re seeking my clearance before proceeding?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s what my surgeon – Dr. Alvarez – advised. He said a general check-up with a doctor… like yourself… was necessary before I could be considered a good candidate. I’m… quite particular about wanting to be thorough, if that makes sense. And Dr. Alvarez is very good, so I trust his judgment implicitly. I just… sometimes struggle to recall why certain things are important, you see? It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with the basics, then. What kind of surgery are we discussing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky one. It’s… cosmetic. It involves… well, it’s to do with my face. I’m so sorry, this is incredibly vague, isn’t it? It’s not that I'm trying to be difficult, Doctor, it’s just… the details are a bit hazy. Something about restoring… balance, I think? Dr. Alvarez explained it all very patiently, but it didn't quite… stick. Would it be easier if I just said it’s to correct some… imperfections?
DOCTOR: Imperfections. Right. And how long have you been considering this surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a difficult question. A long time, I think. Perhaps… a year? Maybe a little longer? It feels like a very long time, but time gets away from me these days. It wasn’t an immediate decision. It was… a process. My late husband… he thought it might be a good idea, eventually. He always encouraged me to do things that would make me happy. But it wasn’t until… well, after he passed that I started seriously looking into it. I apologize for rambling. It’s just… connected to a lot of memories.
DOCTOR: A year… after the loss of your husband. Alright. And has anything specifically prompted you to pursue this now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. Dr. Alvarez has a new technique, he explained. It’s… less invasive, with a faster recovery time. That was a significant factor. And… I suppose I’m feeling a bit more… ready, if that makes sense? I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I realized it’s something I want for myself. Not because anyone else wants it, but for me. It's a bit silly, perhaps, but it feels… important to reclaim something. I hope that doesn’t sound too strange. I’m sorry, I’m probably not making any sense.
DOCTOR: Reclaim something… Right. Let’s move on. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had a bout of… influenza last winter, but that cleared up quickly. And I have… slight allergies, mostly seasonal. Pollen, things like that. Nothing major. I do have… a history of mild anxiety, but it’s well-managed. I haven’t needed any medication for it in years. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I’m quite diligent about regular check-ups, when I remember, of course. Do you need a list of any medications I've taken previously? It's… somewhere in my files, I think.
DOCTOR: Well-managed anxiety and seasonal allergies. And you haven’t been prescribed anything for the anxiety recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Not recently, or ever, really. It flares up occasionally, but I manage it with… breathing exercises and trying to stay active. It’s never been severe enough to warrant medication, thankfully. I find focusing on my gardening helps tremendously, actually. It's very therapeutic. I'm quite particular about my roses, if you're interested. But… no, no prescriptions for anxiety or anything else currently. Just the occasional antihistamine during pollen season. I hope that's clear enough? I worry about forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, actually. A long time ago. When I was… quite young. I had my appendix removed, I believe. And… I had a rather nasty break in my arm as a child – a fall from a tree, if you can imagine! It required a cast and… I think there was a small operation to set it properly. But that was… decades ago. Nothing recent, and nothing… complicated. It all healed well, thankfully. I remember the pain, of course, but… the details are a bit fuzzy. I’m so sorry. My memory is truly dreadful sometimes. Would it be helpful to check my medical records for more specifics?
DOCTOR: We can access your EHR, yes. But I need to finish the history first. Family history – any significant illnesses amongst your parents or siblings?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Family history… That’s a bit difficult. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And… she had some issues with her heart later in life. My father was… fairly healthy, as far as I know. He passed away suddenly, unfortunately. A heart attack, I think. I don't believe either of them had any… serious illnesses when they were younger. I have an older brother, but we aren’t very close, so I don’t know much about his medical history. He lives… very far away. I hope that’s helpful? I'm afraid my family isn't very forthcoming with medical details, if you understand what I mean. It's… a bit of a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and cardiac issues in your mother. Alright. And finally, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… I think I’m allergic to penicillin. Or… I had a bad reaction to it when I was a child. A rash, I believe. I haven’t taken it in… decades, so I’m not entirely sure. And… I seem to recall a mild reaction to a local anesthetic once, but it was very minor. Just a bit of itching. Nothing severe. I always make sure to inform my dentist about it, just in case. And I’m very careful about trying new medications, even over-the-counter ones. I'm… quite cautious about anything I put into my body, if you understand. I'm rather sensitive, I suppose. Would it be helpful to check my records for specifics? It would be terribly useful to have confirmation, wouldn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll access the records. Let's proceed with a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly sensible. A physical exam, yes. Just… allow me a moment. My balance isn't what it used to be. If you’ll excuse me… It’s just… a bit high up, isn’t it? But I'll manage. Thank you for your patience.
DOCTOR: Take your time. I’ll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 135/85… Pulse is 78… Temperature is normal. Respiration is… 16. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Breathing deeply, yes. Is that… alright? I hope I’m not doing it wrong. It’s just… I tend to overthink these things. I’m perfectly comfortable, though. Just let me know if you need me to do anything differently. It’s… a bit strange being listened to, isn't it? But I understand it’s necessary. Please feel free to ask if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but diminished at the bases. Now, I'll palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh, a murmur, you say? That doesn't sound… entirely good, does it? But I suppose many things can cause murmurs, can’t they? And diminished sounds… at the bases, you said? I’m perfectly comfortable, Doctor, though. No tenderness currently. I do sometimes get a bit of… indigestion, particularly if I eat something rich. But nothing painful. You may proceed. No discomfort at all. I'll let you know if anything changes. Please… take your time. I'm trying very hard to relax.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-distended, no guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, let’s examine your facial structure. Please sit up.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Soft and non-distended sounds… reassuring. Reflexes 2+, you say? Is that… normal? Facial structure now, yes. I suppose that's where… things get a bit more specific, isn't it? I’m ready, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to… hold a particular expression or anything like that. I'll do my best. I do worry about… appearing self-conscious, if you understand. But I trust your judgment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Alright. There's some asymmetry, as you likely know. And some skin laxity. Now, let’s review your EHR. The records confirm a history of penicillin allergy and well-managed anxiety. There's also a note about a childhood arm fracture, as you mentioned. Previous influenza infection last winter. Blood pressure has been consistently slightly elevated, as noted by your primary care physician. And... a prior consultation with a dermatologist regarding some minor skin lesions, which resolved without treatment. Alright. Based on your history and physical exam, you are generally healthy for your age, but your blood pressure is a concern. The asymmetry and skin laxity are consistent with your concerns about cosmetic surgery.
PATIENT: Oh, blood pressure, yes. My primary care physician did mention it… I tend to forget these things, truthfully. It’s… a bit frustrating. So, the asymmetry and laxity… are consistent, you say? That’s… reassuring to hear, I suppose. Does that mean… I’m a suitable candidate for surgery, Doctor? Or are there… concerns that might preclude me from proceeding? I understand if there are. I’m simply trying to… manage my expectations. And… what about the blood pressure? Would that need to be addressed first? I’m perfectly willing to do whatever is necessary, of course. But I’m… a little nervous, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure will need to be controlled prior to surgery. Ideally below 140/90. We can start you on a low dose antihypertensive medication and monitor your levels. As for suitability... based on your age and overall health, you are a candidate, but the slight murmur requires a cardiology consult to rule out any underlying issues. And finally, given your history of anxiety, I recommend a psychological evaluation to ensure you have realistic expectations and are prepared for the recovery process. It is important to have a comprehensive approach to minimize risk and optimize outcomes. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Cardiology… and psychological evaluation… That’s… more than I anticipated, truthfully. Blood pressure medication… cardiology consult… and… a psychological evaluation. Is… is the murmur serious, Doctor? And… is the anxiety a significant concern? I do manage it, as I mentioned, and I'm perfectly stable. I understand the need for a comprehensive approach, of course. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, if I’m honest. And… how long will these evaluations take? And… will it delay the surgery significantly? I’m perfectly willing to do whatever is necessary, but… I’ve been waiting for a long time, you see.
DOCTOR: The murmur is not immediately life-threatening, but it requires assessment. We cannot proceed with surgery until we have a clear understanding of its etiology. As for your anxiety, it’s not a matter of being stable, it’s a matter of ensuring you are prepared for the emotional and psychological impact of surgery and recovery. Surgery is a significant stressor, even for those who are normally well-adjusted. These evaluations will likely take several weeks to schedule and complete, yes. And yes, it will delay the surgery. But it is far more important to prioritize your safety and well-being than to rush the process. I will provide you with referrals to a cardiologist and a psychologist. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results of the evaluations. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Several weeks… I understand. Safety… and well-being. Can you recommend… a cardiologist who specializes in… geriatric care? I've heard… that's important. And… the psychologist… is there one who has experience with… cosmetic surgery patients? I understand the need for a thorough evaluation. It’s just… I’m a little nervous about navigating the medical system. And… what if the evaluations reveal… something that precludes me from surgery entirely? I’m perfectly willing to do whatever is necessary, but… it’s a little overwhelming. And… what about the blood pressure medication? Will that interact with any other medications I’m taking? I just… want to be prepared. .
DOCTOR: Yes, I can provide you with referrals to both a geriatric cardiologist and a psychologist experienced with cosmetic surgery patients. As for the blood pressure medication, we’ll start with a low dose and monitor for any potential interactions. However, you need to provide me with a complete list of all medications you are currently taking – including over-the-counter supplements and herbal remedies. And yes, it is possible the evaluations may reveal a contraindication to surgery. But we will cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s focus on scheduling the evaluations. I have the referral forms here. Here. And please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks. I believe we've covered everything for today. .
