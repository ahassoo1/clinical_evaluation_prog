DOCTOR: Alright, Josie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don't have all day. It's this… stuff. Coming up. Acid, I guess? Happens mostly when I lie down. Really unpleasant. And it's been going on for a while now, you know? A good while. Don't need a lecture, just a fix.
DOCTOR: "A while," right. Okay. So, it's… coming up?
PATIENT: Yes! Up. From my stomach. Regurgitation, my wife calls it. She reads a lot of those health magazines. I just know it’s not pleasant and it keeps me up at night. Honestly, I’ve tried everything over the counter. Tums, antacids… the whole nine yards. Nothing seems to really stick, if you know what I mean. Waste of money, really.
DOCTOR: Right, right. And how often would you say this "stuff" comes up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Most nights, at least. Sometimes it's just a little, other times… well, let's just say I have to change my shirt. It's embarrassing, you know? Especially when we travel. My wife gets so annoyed. It's not like I want it to happen. I eat normal food, not like I'm stuffing myself with garbage all the time. Though, I do enjoy a good kielbasa now and then. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Kielbasa… Okay. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I get heartburn, of course. That's part of it. And sometimes my throat feels a little… scratchy. Like something's been irritating it. And I have to clear my throat a lot, especially in the morning. But other than that, I feel fine. I'm a healthy man, for my age. Six foot five, you know. Pretty rare these days. Though, I've lost some weight recently. Probably from worrying about this whole… mess.
DOCTOR: Lost weight… How much weight, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know, maybe ten, fifteen pounds? It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t weigh myself every day. I'm a busy man, I run the emergency management for the whole county! Don't have time for fussing over numbers. But my pants are a little looser, that's for sure. And my wife keeps saying I look thinner, which is just… well, unhelpful. She worries too much. It's probably just stress, really. All these storms we've been having... it keeps a fella on edge. But this… stuff… is still happening. And it's getting old. Really old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Lie down for me, please. I'm going to listen to your chest and feel your abdomen. Don’t worry, it won’t take long.
PATIENT: Listen to my chest? What for? I don't have a cough or anything. Look, I appreciate you seeing me, but I'm telling you, it’s just acid. I need something to stop it. Not a whole examination. Is this going to take long? I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting. About the flood plan. Honestly, doc, you’re wasting my time. But fine, I'll lie down. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be comfortable. This table is hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: Just routine, Mr. Altine. Helps me rule things out. Chest first. Breathe deeply. Abdomen feels… soft. No masses. A little tenderness in the epigastric region, but not significant. Your heart sounds regular. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72. Okay. Now, I'm going to need to order some blood work and possibly an endoscopy. That's a scope to look at your esophagus and stomach.
PATIENT: Endoscopy? A scope? You're going to stick a camera down my throat? Absolutely not. No way. I've heard about those things. Sounds awful. And blood work? I just had blood work done last month! For the physical. And what will that even tell you? It's acid, doc. Plain and simple. I need a pill. A strong pill. Something to neutralize it. Not a bunch of tests and procedures. Honestly, this is ridiculous. You're making a mountain out of a molehill. I've got a county to run, I don't have time for this. Just give me something for the acid. Please. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, with all due respect, you’ve been self-treating for an unknown amount of time. I understand your frustration, but dismissing potential issues without proper investigation isn’t safe. The blood work will rule out other causes, and the endoscopy is the best way to visualize what's going on. We need to rule out things like ulcers, Barrett’s esophagus, or even something more serious. I'm not trying to waste your time, I'm trying to provide you with the best possible care. I will write you a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor, which should help reduce the acid production. But you need to schedule the endoscopy. I'll have the nurse give you the referral information. .
