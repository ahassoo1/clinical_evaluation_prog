DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Schneer’s the name. Hmm… what brings me in? Now let me think… It’s somethin’ about… not hearin’ so good, I reckon. It’s been gettin’ worse lately, that’s for sure. Folks gotta repeat themselves a lot. I don't rightly remember when it started, though. Seems like… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, so you’re experiencing some difficulty with your hearing, and it’s been gradually worsening. And it's been going on for a while now, you said?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Gradual. That’s a good word for it. Not like it just popped, you know? Just… faded. Like an old radio, maybe? I used to be able to hear a pin drop, my mother always said. Now… well, now it’s a bit of a struggle, especially with women's voices. They seem to get lost easy. Though, I can’t say for sure. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's been a slow process, and that’s helpful to know. And you’ve noticed it's more difficult to hear women's voices, specifically. That’s a specific detail, and we can certainly explore that further. Before we go any further, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, any dizziness, or any pain associated with the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm… sometimes, yes. A little bit of a… whine, I suppose you’d call it. Not all the time, though. Comes and goes. And no dizziness, no. Never had much trouble with dizziness. And no pain, neither. Just… quiet. Too quiet, mostly. Is that somethin' I should be worried about? I get a bit confused with all this medical stuff, you see.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. It’s good you're asking questions. The ringing, or tinnitus as we call it, is something we’ll note. No dizziness or pain is good. Now, Mr. Schneer, have you ever been exposed to loud noises regularly – perhaps at work, or as a hobby?
PATIENT: Loud noises… aye, at the factory, for sure. Shoe factory, it was. Lots of machines, clatterin' and thumpin' all day long. For… oh, goodness, must’ve been forty years, maybe more. Never thought much about it at the time. Just part of the job, you know? We all wore earplugs sometimes, but not always, I reckon. Especially when we were tryin' to hear each other over the noise. Does that matter? I don’t rightly recall what kind of earplugs they were, though. They weren’t fancy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely matters, Mr. Schneer. Prolonged exposure to loud noises, like you experienced at the factory, is a very common cause of hearing loss. It's good you mentioned that. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, the doctor told me a while back my blood pressure was a bit high, but I take pills for it. Been takin’ ‘em for…oh, I don’t know, ten years maybe? And my knees… they bother me somethin’ awful when it rains. Arthritis, they said. Aside from that… I think that’s about it. I've been lucky, all things considered. I get a bit breathless if I walk too far, but I mostly just take things easy these days. Does Medicare cover hearin’ aids, by the way? That’s somethin’ I’ve been wonderin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which you manage with medication, and arthritis in your knees. And some shortness of breath with exertion. That’s good information to have. We’ll make a note of all of that. And that’s a very good question about Medicare coverage for hearing aids. The coverage can be a bit complex, and it depends on a few factors. We’ll have our billing department provide you with information about that after the consultation. Now, Mr. Schneer, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Just the little white pills for my blood pressure. Sometimes I take a bit of somethin’ for my knees when they’re really achin’, but that’s just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Like… ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Not every day, though. Only when I really need it. And sometimes I take a little somethin' for sleep, but that's only when I can't get to sleep. My daughter gives it to me when I visit. I don’t remember the name of that one, neither. She handles most of my medicines, truth be told.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily blood pressure medication, occasional ibuprofen for your knees, and something for sleep as needed, which your daughter provides. It sounds like she’s very helpful. We’ll get a list of all your medications from her if possible, just to be sure we have everything accurate. Now, Mr. Schneer, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I can recall. I used to scratch a bit when I was a lad, but my mother said it was just the hay fever. Never had a bad reaction to any pills, not that I remember. I've had a bit of a runny nose lately, but that's just the weather, I reckon. It’s been damp, you see. A bit of a chill in the air. Is that important? I just don't want to leave anything out.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. It’s good you're being thorough. No known allergies is good to know. Now, Mr. Schneer, I'd like to do a quick exam of your ears, just to get a better look and see what's going on. It won't take long, and it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that's fine. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. My ears feel a bit…stuffed, sometimes. Like there's cotton wool in 'em. But I don't feel no pain, so I don't worry about it too much. Just a bit quiet, mostly. Go ahead, then. I'll just sit here and try not to move. Though, my knees might creak a bit. They always do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Just relax. I’ll be gentle. It's good you've described the feeling of fullness; that's helpful. Okay… I’m looking in your ears now. I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, which is common. The ear canals themselves look normal. The eardrums appear intact, but they are a bit…dull. I'm going to perform a quick hearing test now, just to get a better idea of how well you’re hearing different sounds. It’s a simple test, and I’ll explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Wax buildup… that's probably it, then. I don't clean 'em much, I always worried I'd push it further in. Dull, you say? Is that bad? I don't mind a bit of dullness, as long as I can still hear my daughter when she visits. A hearin' test… alright. Just tell me what to do. I'll try my best. I ain’t as quick as I used to be, though. And my knees… well, you know about my knees. But I'll sit still. Just point me in the right direction.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. We’ll take our time. It’s good you haven’t been cleaning them much; you were right to be cautious. The “dullness” just means the eardrums aren’t as vibrant as they should be, which can be caused by a number of things, including wax buildup, fluid, or age-related changes. We’ll see what the hearing test tells us. Okay, I'm going to put these headphones on for you. I’m going to play some tones at different volumes in each ear, and I want you to press the button every time you hear a sound, no matter how faint. It’s important to be honest, even if you barely hear it. Just press the button whenever you detect a tone. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I think so. Headphones and a button. Press it when I hear a sound, even if it's quiet. Easy enough, I reckon. Though, my brain ain't what it used to be. I might miss a few. Just tell me if I'm doin' it wrong. And don’t mind if I fidget a bit. My knees… well, you know. Alright. Let’s get on with it, then. I'm ready when you are. Just don’t shout too loud, alright? I'm a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I’ll keep the volume at a comfortable level. And don’t worry about missing any sounds. We’re just getting a general idea of your hearing ability. And it's perfectly alright to fidget. Alright, I’m starting now. Just listen carefully and press the button when you hear a tone…
PATIENT: …Hmm… that one…yes. Oh, and that one. No, wait… was that one? I think so… maybe. It’s hard to tell, Doctor. They all sound a bit… muffled. Like listenin' through a blanket. And my knees are startin' to ache a bit… is it alright if I wiggle my toes? It helps, you see. And I think I missed a few… I'm sorry. My brain just ain’t workin' like it used to. It's gettin' harder to concentrate, too… is it almost over?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, that's perfectly alright. We've gotten enough information. It's completely understandable that it's difficult to concentrate, and your knees are certainly a valid distraction. Based on the hearing test and the examination, it appears you have some degree of high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. The wax buildup is likely contributing to this, but there appears to be some underlying loss as well, which is common at your age. Now, let’s talk about what this means and what we can do about it. First, we can remove the wax buildup. That may improve your hearing somewhat. Second, we can discuss the possibility of a hearing aid if you’re interested. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… wax and age… I figured as much. It's been comin' for a long time, I reckon. High-frequency… what does that mean exactly? Can I still hear my daughter talkin'? That's the most important thing, you see. A hearin' aid… hmm. I always thought those were for old folks. I ain't that old! But… if it would help me hear my daughter better… maybe. What's involved? Is it expensive? And does Medicare cover it? That's the big question, isn't it? I don't want to be a burden to my daughter… she’s got enough on her plate. Talk to me slow, Doctor. My brain's a bit foggy today.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. Let's take it slow. "High-frequency" hearing loss means you have trouble hearing higher-pitched sounds, like birds chirping or the "s" sounds in speech. Lower-pitched sounds, like your daughter's voice, may still be audible, but they might sound muffled or distorted. That's why it can be difficult to understand every word. Removing the wax is a simple procedure, we can do that right here in the office. It shouldn't be painful. As for the hearing aid, they’ve come a long way, Mr. Schneer. They’re much smaller and more sophisticated now. They can be adjusted to amplify the sounds you have trouble hearing, making it easier to understand speech. The cost can vary depending on the type of aid and the features. And yes, you are right to ask about Medicare. Coverage is complex, but they do offer some assistance. We have a billing specialist who can go over the details with you and your daughter. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for wax removal first?
PATIENT: Aye, wax removal first sounds good. Get that out of the way, then we can see where we stand. And then… then maybe we can talk about the hearin’ aid. A bit at a time, that’s what I always say. And could you ask that billin’ lady to talk to my daughter? She's better with all the paperwork and insurance stuff than I am. Bless her heart, she handles everything. When can we get the wax out? And… is it gonna hurt? I don't like pain, you see. I've had enough of that in my life already. Just a little at a time, that's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. A little at a time is a perfect plan. I can schedule the wax removal for tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow at ten… aye, that's fine. Ten o’clock suits me just fine. As long as I can get a cup of tea beforehand. And you promise it won't hurt? Just a little tickle, maybe? Alright. Tomorrow it is, then. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think my knees are startin’ to complain again. I need to get up and stretch ‘em out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It's my pleasure. And don’t worry about your knees – take your time getting up. I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
