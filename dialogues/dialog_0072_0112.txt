DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I’m Dr. Hembrey. I see here you're a new patient with our practice. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the restroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, definitely. It’s… frequent. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. I’m not sure why it’s happening, and it’s a bit disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be disruptive, and there’s no need to be embarrassed. These things happen. Frequent urination… alright. And when you say “a lot,” can you give me a rough estimate of how often you’re going compared to, say, a typical day before this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult to say precisely. Before… well, before things changed, I’d go, I suppose, four or five times a day? Perhaps less. Now… it feels like every hour or two. It varies, honestly. Sometimes it’s less, but often it’s more. It’s hard to keep track, if that makes sense. I don’t mean to be vague, Doctor, it’s just… it’s not something I normally pay attention to.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a noticeable increase from your baseline. And is it just frequency that’s changed, or have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I haven't noticed any pain, thankfully. No burning or discomfort while… you know. And I don’t think my urine looks any different. Maybe a little paler, but I could be imagining things. I’ve been drinking more water, trying to stay hydrated, so that might explain that. No fever, no chills… honestly, just the frequent trips to the restroom. It’s a bit… unsettling, because it feels like something is off, but I can't pinpoint what.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no changes in urine appearance aside from perhaps being slightly paler due to increased fluid intake. You mentioned increased water consumption; is that a conscious effort to address this frequent urination, or are you simply drinking more for other reasons?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question, Doctor. It’s… a bit of both, actually. I started drinking more water because I thought that might help. I read somewhere that it can dilute things, you know, and I thought maybe it would lessen the urge. But I’ve also been trying to be healthier overall, so I’m making a conscious effort to drink more water regardless. It’s just… it hasn’t quite solved the problem, and I’m a little unsure what to do next.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you've proactively increased your fluid intake, but it hasn't fully alleviated the issue. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in diet… Not drastically, no. I haven’t really altered anything major. I’ve tried to cut back on sweets a little, but nothing significant. I do have a cup of coffee every morning, as I’m sure many people do, and perhaps a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. But I’ve been doing that for years, so I don’t think that’s new. It’s really difficult to pinpoint anything, Doctor. I’m not sure if any of this is helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant dietary changes, continued coffee and occasional wine consumption. Now, have you experienced any recent stress or anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That's a bit… personal, Doctor. I have been rather stressed lately, yes. I recently went through a divorce, and it’s been… difficult to adjust. A lot of upheaval, you know? It’s been emotionally draining, to say the least. I hadn’t really considered if that might be connected to this, but… perhaps it could be? I suppose it’s possible. Everything feels a bit unsettled, generally.
DOCTOR: I understand. Significant life changes can certainly contribute to a variety of physical symptoms. Stress can manifest in many ways. Now, let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not much, thankfully. I had chickenpox as a child, of course, and a few minor illnesses over the years, but nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions… I suppose I’m generally quite healthy. I haven't been to the doctor in… well, it’s been a while, to be honest. A routine check-up a few years ago, perhaps? I can’t recall the specifics. I’m not very good with dates, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't take any medications regularly. I might take something for a headache occasionally, but that's it. And I definitely don't take any supplements. I try to eat a balanced diet and get enough rest, and I haven’t felt the need for anything extra. I’m rather averse to taking pills, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – foods, environmental factors, etc.?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions to anything as far as I know. I spend a lot of time outdoors, gardening mostly, and I haven’t had any problems with pollen or anything like that either. I suppose I’m quite lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with a history of diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary issues?
PATIENT: Oh… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother passed away several years ago, and I didn't discuss her medical history in much detail with anyone. My father wasn’t very forthcoming with information either. I know he had high blood pressure, but beyond that… I'm really not sure. I don’t recall anyone specifically mentioning diabetes or kidney problems, but I wouldn’t be able to say definitively. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s not something I’ve ever really thought about before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history information available. Now, could you briefly describe your social habits – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! I absolutely do not smoke. I mentioned I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s the extent of my alcohol consumption. And I definitely do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a very quiet life, mostly gardening and reading. I’m not much of a social butterfly, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol consumption, no recreational drug use. Now, Ms. MacVittie, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It will be a standard examination. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Finally, I’d like to perform a quick neurological assessment and check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, but that doesn’t necessarily rule anything out. Given your symptoms and the recent stress you've been experiencing, the most likely explanation is a form of stress-induced urinary frequency. However, to rule out any underlying medical causes, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the basic metabolic panel will assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. If it will help rule things out, I’m happy to have those tests done. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and feel like myself again. How long will it take to get the results? And is there anything I should do in the meantime?
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay hydrated, but try not to overdo it, especially before bedtime. Also, try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. I understand that’s easier said than done, but even small things like deep breathing exercises or spending time in nature can make a difference. Given your recent divorce, it might also be beneficial to consider speaking with a therapist or counselor. They can provide support and guidance as you navigate this challenging time. I can provide you with a list of local resources if you're interested. In the unlikely event that you develop a fever, experience pain in your back or abdomen, or notice blood in your urine, please contact us immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That’s… very thoughtful of you, Doctor, offering the resources for counseling. I hadn’t really considered that, but… perhaps it wouldn’t hurt. Yes, please, if you could provide me with a list, that would be wonderful. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at this moment. Just… thank you again for your time and attention. I feel a bit more reassured now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. My nurse will have that list for you before you leave. We'll contact you as soon as your lab results are available. If anything changes or you have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call. I wish you all the best, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
