DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever keeps coming back. It’s been a bit of a nuisance, really. I haven’t been feeling myself, and my wife, Elena, she’s been worried sick.
DOCTOR: A recurring fever, alright. And you said you haven’t been feeling yourself… can you elaborate on that a little?
PATIENT: Well, tired mostly. Just… worn out. And a little achy, you know? Like I pulled something, but I didn't. It comes and goes with the fever. Happens maybe once a week now for the last month or so. It's not debilitating, but it's definitely not normal for me. I usually have a lot more pep.
DOCTOR: Once a week for a month… that is persistent. And the aches come with the fever, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Right when the fever starts, the aches hit. Mostly in my back and legs. Then they fade when the fever goes down. It's like clockwork, honestly. I’ve been taking some over-the-counter stuff for the fever, but it only helps for a little while. Doesn't really fix anything.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter… which medications have you been using?
PATIENT: Uh… mostly Tylenol. And sometimes, if it’s really bad, I’ll take some ibuprofen. Like I said, it takes the edge off, but it always comes back. Elena keeps telling me I should see a doctor, so here I am. I just don’t usually bother with doctors, if you know what I mean. Waste of time, usually. But this keeps happening…
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, it's good you're here now. We’ll try to figure out what's going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fever and aches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough, no congestion. No… rashes or anything like that. I’ve been sweating a little more at night, maybe? But Elena says that’s just the summer heat. Oh! And my appetite’s been a little off, but I figured that was just because I don’t feel good. Nothing major, just not as hungry as usual.
DOCTOR: Sweating at night and a decreased appetite… alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with diet and exercise. That’s it, honestly. No diabetes, no heart problems… I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I go for a walk every morning, try to eat right. That’s why this fever is so confusing! I’m usually a pretty robust guy.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Broke my arm when I was a kid, playing baseball, but that was it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I try to stay out of doctors' offices as much as possible, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had arthritis, bad arthritis when she got older. My father, he had some heart trouble, but lived a long life, into his eighties. Elena’s mother had… diabetes, I think. But nothing that runs strongly in either family, really. Just the usual old age stuff. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications besides the Tylenol and ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Nope. Just those two, when I need them. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel sluggish. Elena keeps trying to get me to take something for my blood pressure, but the diet works just fine. It has for years. She worries too much, that woman. A good woman, but… a worrier.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take anything. That’s one less thing to worry about, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your abdomen, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Get it over with. I got things to do, you know? But, yeah. Fine. Just… try to be quick, if you could. Elena’s waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your temperature. 100.8. Okay. Now if you could just lie back on the exam table… I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is a little wheezy, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular. Now I’m going to palpate your abdomen…any pain here?
PATIENT: Nope. Not really. A little tender, maybe, but nothing sharp. Just… normal tenderness. I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, so maybe that’s it. Elena says I eat too much spicy food. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Lymph nodes feel slightly swollen, but not significantly. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal so far, but given the recurring fever, night sweats, and slight lymph node swelling, I think we need to do some blood work to rule out any potential infections. It could be something simple, like a virus, but it’s best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… Fine. Whatever you think is best. It’s just… a pain, you know? Waiting for results, going back and forth. But, yeah. Do it. Let’s just get this over with. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a few inflammatory markers. It should give us a better idea of what’s going on. It usually takes a couple of days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory to help with the fever and aches. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should help manage your symptoms while we wait for the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. As long as it doesn’t knock me out. I gotta keep moving, you know? Elena’s got me doing a lot of things around the house these days. So, as long as it lets me function, fine. Just… write it down, whatever it is. Let's just get this done. Where do I go to get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: Here you are. The lab is just down the hall, first door on the left. They’ll take about ten minutes. And here's a prescription for Naproxen, 500mg twice a day as needed for fever and aches. Take it with food. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they come back. If you develop any new symptoms – a rash, severe shortness of breath, anything unusual – please call us immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Nope. I think that covers it. Naproxen, take with food, call if anything bad happens. Got it. Alright. Well, thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you getting this done. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I'm gonna go get this blood drawn then. See ya.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Brege. We’ll be in touch. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. .
