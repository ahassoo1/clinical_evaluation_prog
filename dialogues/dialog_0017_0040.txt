DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my side, mostly. Been hurting on and off for a while now. And… I keep getting these water infections, you see. Seems like they come back pretty quick after the medicine finishes. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “On and off” is rather vague, Mr. Espinueva. Can you be more specific about the location and nature of this side pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sorry. It’s… it’s on both sides, lower down, where your ribs kind of curve around. Not right on the bone, but nearby. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, that sometimes gets worse. Like a heavy feeling, if that makes sense? And it can come and go throughout the day. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times… well, it’s hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: “Heavy feeling,” interesting. And these water infections, as you call them… how often are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I’d say, on average, maybe once every two or three months. But sometimes it’s closer together, like every month. It's… it's been happening for a few years now, but it feels more frequent lately. I try to drink plenty of water, you know, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Do you need the exact dates, Doctor? I don’t usually keep track, to be perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: No, dates are unnecessary at this juncture. Mr. Espinueva, have you noticed any changes in your urine—color, odor, frequency, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the color is usually a bit darker than usual, you see. And sometimes it smells a bit… stronger, I suppose. Not a bad smell, exactly, just not normal. And yes, I do find myself needing to go more often, even if I haven’t had much to drink. It’s a bit of a nuisance, really. Sometimes it burns a little when I go, too. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: Burning sensation is… suggestive. Now, let’s move on. Any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or back pain accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fever, chills, or sickness, not at all. And my back is fine, no pain there. It’s mostly just the side and… well, the trouble with the waterworks, you see. I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but I put that down to my age, to be honest. I’m not as sprightly as I used to be! But no real sickness, no.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with palpation of your abdomen and flanks.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Just let me know if I need to do anything special, Doctor. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Mr. Espinueva. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen and sides. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. I’m noting some mild tenderness in both lower flanks, as you can see. Nothing overtly concerning at this stage. Now, let's listen to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished. I will also need to check your back. Please turn over. Tenderness present along the lower lumbar spine, but not acutely painful. No obvious vertebral abnormalities.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That wasn’t too bad. Yes, I do feel a little bit of ache there, where you were pressing on my back. It’s not sharp, more like… a dull pressure. Like a weight on my lower back, you see. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I do worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: Your symptoms, coupled with the exam findings, are… suggestive of several possibilities. We need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count to assess for infection and inflammation. We’ll also need to do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. I'm also ordering a kidney ultrasound to rule out any structural abnormalities. I want to be thorough. We'll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – at least eight glasses of water a day – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. I'll call you with the results as soon as they come in. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… thorough, yes. Eight glasses of water, you say? I’ll try my best. I do enjoy a cup of tea sometimes, though. Will I have to stop completely? And what about these tests… will they be uncomfortable, Doctor? I’m not very good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: A single cup of tea is unlikely to be detrimental, Mr. Espinueva, but I strongly advise limiting your caffeine intake. As for the tests, the blood draw will be a minor discomfort—a quick pinch. The ultrasound is non-invasive—a technician will simply glide a probe over your abdomen. No needles involved. I’ll have the lab draw scheduled for tomorrow morning. And I will also have my assistant schedule the ultrasound. We will proceed methodically. Now, is there anything else you wish to discuss, or shall we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for your time. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I do feel a bit better knowing we’re getting things checked out. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will guide you to the scheduling desk. I expect a prompt follow-up when the results are available. Good day, Mr. Espinueva. .
