DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. Like I might… lose my balance. It’s been concerning. I don't recall exactly when it started, though. It feels like it’s been some time.
DOCTOR: Hmm, unsteady… alright. And you said some time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s the frustrating part. It isn’t a recent thing, not that I can pinpoint. Weeks, perhaps? Months, even? It’s… vague. I wish I could be more helpful with the timing. Everything feels a bit… hazy lately, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, hazy… alright. Let's try to narrow things down. Is this unsteadiness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and others… well, others I feel as though I’m walking on a ship. Not constantly, thankfully. It seems worse when I'm… tired, I believe. Though again, it's hard to say for certain. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Worse when tired… Alright. Any dizziness associated with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes, yes. Not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like a… lightness in my head. A floating feeling, perhaps. It doesn't happen every time I feel unsteady, but it occurs often enough that I thought it worth mentioning. It's difficult to describe.
DOCTOR: Lightness, floating... alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this—anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, now that you mention it, I have been rather… fatigued. More so than usual for my line of work, I would say. And my appetite hasn’t been quite the same. Smaller portions, mostly. It’s subtle, but I have noticed it. Oh, and… I seem to be bruising rather easily, now that I think of it. Little bumps, and… well, noticeable marks.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, decreased appetite, easy bruising… Have you had any fevers, unexplained weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fevers… no, I don’t believe so. I haven't been taking my temperature, but I don’t feel feverish. Weight loss… that's possible. I haven't been weighing myself, but my clothes do seem a little looser than they were. And night sweats… yes, actually. Now that you ask, I have been waking up feeling rather damp. It isn’t every night, but it’s happened a few times recently. I hadn’t thought much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. And, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… That's a difficult question, Doctor. I... well, my husband, he always handled those things. He passed away about a year ago, and… truthfully, I haven't been to the doctor much since then. I know I’ve had the usual vaccinations, and… I believe I had chickenpox as a child. Nothing major, that I recall. He always managed everything when it came to appointments and such. I apologize for being so vague. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, a year ago… I understand. No significant past medical history… Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I've always been quite healthy, generally. Until recently, that is. He always said I was strong as an ox. Working out in the oil fields will do that to a person, I suppose. Though lately… I don’t feel nearly as strong. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… difficult. My family is mostly back in Ethiopia, and we haven’t been in regular contact for a very long time. I know my mother lived to a good age, but beyond that… I honestly don’t have much information. I never asked much about medical conditions, and… we didn’t discuss it often. I apologize again for my lack of detail, Doctor. It's frustrating to not be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family medical history. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't been taking anything regularly. Just… occasional painkillers for aches and pains from work. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter. And no vitamins or supplements, no. I’ve always believed in a good diet and plenty of rest, though lately… that hasn’t been enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I know, I don’t have any allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. He always double-checked when I needed something, but I’ve never had to tell anyone about an allergy. It’s been a blessing, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Lilyanna. Well, given your symptoms – the unsteadiness, fatigue, easy bruising, decreased appetite, and night sweats – I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Anything that might help figure this out, I’m happy to do. A physical exam and blood work… absolutely. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for trying to understand. It’s… reassuring. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your height and weight, then we'll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and do a brief neurological exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Height and weight first, then blood pressure and pulse… I understand. I'll do whatever you need. Please just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with the scale. Just stand as still as you can, and I'll get a reading. You mentioned working in the oil fields – that can be quite strenuous. What sort of work do you do specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As for what I do… I operate a rotary drill. It's… a physical job, to say the least. A lot of heavy lifting, maneuvering equipment, and… well, long hours in demanding conditions. It requires a lot of strength and coordination, which is why I'm so concerned about feeling unsteady. I'm usually very steady on my feet. It’s a bit worrying, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: 193 centimeters and 150 pounds. Alright. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That’s within normal limits. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you'll just lie back on the examination table, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow your finger. I’m focusing on it now. I hope I'm doing it correctly. It's… a little difficult, but I'm trying my best. Please let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And can you squeeze my hands, as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Is that sufficient? I don’t want to hurt you, but I also want to give you an accurate reading. Please tell me if it’s too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, good strength. And now, can you touch your nose with your finger, then touch my nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? I'm trying to be as precise as possible. It feels… a little clumsy, but I'm attempting it. Please let me know if I’m not doing it correctly. It’s strange feeling a little unsteady while performing these tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, good coordination, but a slight tremor is noticeable. Now, can you stand up, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Alright. It’s… a little difficult, I must admit. I feel rather off-balance, even more so than usual. I'm trying to steady myself. Please let me know if you see anything concerning. I’m worried I might fall.
DOCTOR: Easy now. Yes, a slight instability is present. Alright, Lilyanna. Based on the exam and your reported symptoms, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out several possibilities. We’ll be checking your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, kidney function, and vitamin levels, specifically vitamin B12 and folate. And I also want to check your iron levels. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. A complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, vitamin levels, and iron… It seems very thorough. I trust your judgment, and I'm happy to do whatever tests you deem necessary. I just want to figure out what’s going on. When will I be able to get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab should have the results back within 3 to 5 business days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe dizziness, weakness, confusion, or bleeding – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I also want to suggest you limit strenuous activity until we have the results back. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. 3 to 5 business days, and I'll contact you when the results are in. I'll go to the emergency room if anything worsens, and I’ll definitely limit strenuous activity. It’s… a relief to have a plan. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for being so thorough. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. And if you have any questions or concerns at all, don't hesitate to call the office. My nurse is excellent and can help with anything. Here's a printed list of the tests and instructions. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate you taking the time to help me understand what might be going on. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. I’ll be sure to contact the office if I have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You too, Lilyanna. Take care. And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
