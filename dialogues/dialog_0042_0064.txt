DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my chest... it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chest pain is certainly something we want to take seriously. “Tightness” is a good way to describe it. Could you tell me a little more about when this pain started?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started, oh, maybe… three weeks ago? I was gardening, pulling weeds. It wasn't a bad pain right away, just a little uncomfortable. But it’s been happening more since then, even when I’m just sitting, watching television. Not every time, but often enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, starting with gardening… and now it happens even at rest. Does the pain radiate anywhere – for example, to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Yes! Sometimes… it goes into my left arm. Not all the way to my hand, but mostly in my upper arm and shoulder. And… now that you mention it, yes, a little bit to my jaw too. Not a sharp pain in the jaw, just… a dull ache. Like when you have a bad tooth, maybe?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that detail, Sherion. That’s important information. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. It’s not always there, thank goodness. It lasts… maybe five or ten minutes at a time? Sometimes longer if I’m doing something… like walking up the stairs. Then it goes away, and then it comes back later. It's very unpredictable, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Intermittent pain, lasting five to ten minutes, brought on by activity. Does anything make it better – for example, resting, sitting still, or taking any medication?
PATIENT: Yes, resting helps a lot. If I stop what I’m doing and just sit down, it usually goes away pretty quick. Maybe in five or ten minutes, like you said. I haven’t taken anything for it yet. I didn’t want to take pills if I didn’t have to, you know? I thought maybe it would just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Now, let's talk a little bit about other things you may be experiencing. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or dizziness along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... shortness of breath, yes, sometimes. Not bad shortness, but… I get winded easier when I’m walking. Sweating… not really. And no dizziness, thankfully. I get a little bit… anxious when the pain starts, but that’s probably just because it scares me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some shortness of breath with exertion and anxiety when the pain occurs. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, no cold or flu recently. Last time I was sick was… oh, goodness, last winter, maybe? Just a little sniffle, nothing bad. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables. But this chest pain… it’s different than anything I’ve felt before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion. It's good you're proactive about your health. Let's review your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… yes, the doctor told me a few years ago I had a little bit. He put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. I didn’t like taking pills, and he said I could try to control it with diet. And… my mother had some heart problems when she was older. Not sure exactly what, but she had to go to the hospital a few times.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure and a family history of heart problems. That's important to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had my gallbladder out, oh, maybe twenty years ago? And I had a knee replacement five years ago. That went pretty well, thank goodness. But that’s it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a knee replacement. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just the one pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. I don’t take it every day, just when I remember. And… no allergies to medications that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to, but he quit a long time ago. He said it was the best thing he ever did.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, not much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, once or twice a week? Sometimes not even that. I don't really care for it much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your chest to see if there’s any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I’m a little worried, but I’m glad you’re listening.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular, but I am detecting a very faint murmur. I’ll need to evaluate that further. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is elevated at 148/92. Your pulse is 80 beats per minute. Finally, I gently palpate your chest. </stage> There is some tenderness to the left of your sternum, but no significant masses or deformities. I also want to check your extremities for any swelling. There is no swelling in your legs. I'll document these findings.
PATIENT: Oh… elevated blood pressure? That doesn’t sound good. And a murmur? Is that bad, Doctor? I’m a little scared now. I just want to know what’s going on, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion. It's natural to be worried. An elevated blood pressure needs to be managed, but it’s often controlled with lifestyle changes or medication. And a murmur doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It just means there's an extra sound when your heart beats, and we need to investigate it further to determine the cause. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings, I want to order some tests. I’d like to get an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart, and some blood work, including a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and cardiac enzymes to rule out any heart damage. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Tests are… good. Better to know, right? Yes, please. I just want to feel better. Can you tell me where I go to get these tests done? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Exactly, better to know. The lab and radiology department are just down the hall. I'll have my nurse, Maria, print out the orders for you. She'll also schedule the chest X-ray for you. The EKG and blood work results usually come back within a few hours, but the chest X-ray results may take a day or two to be reviewed by the radiologist. Once I have all the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds… manageable. No strenuous activity, I can do that. And I will remember to go to the emergency room if things get worse. Um… yes, one question. You said cardiac enzymes… is that to see if my heart is damaged? It sounds… scary.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. Cardiac enzymes are proteins released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is injured. Measuring their levels can help determine if there has been any damage to your heart. It can indicate a heart attack, but elevated levels can also be caused by other things, such as inflammation. It's simply a precaution to rule out any serious problems, and we won't know anything for sure until we get the results. I'm ordering the test to be thorough, not because I believe something is definitely wrong. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes a little more sense. To be thorough, not because something is wrong. Okay. That’s… reassuring. I guess. Well, thank you, Doctor. I’m still worried, but I feel better knowing you’re taking it seriously. I'll go get these tests done now. Where did you say Maria was?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. I understand your worry, and I’ll do everything I can to figure out what's going on. Maria is at the nurses' station, just around the corner. She'll be happy to help you with the orders and schedule your chest X-ray. Don't hesitate to ask her if you have any questions. I'll be in my office if you need anything further. Please take care of yourself, and remember to rest. And I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. .
