DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t really feel any different. It was just a number on a machine. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good your husband is looking out for you, even if it feels a little unnecessary right now. High blood pressure can be a bit of a silent condition, so it’s wise to investigate. Just because you don’t feel anything doesn’t mean it isn’t worth checking. The nurse did mention a reading of… 148 over 92, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Honestly, I was probably just stressed when they took it. Work has been… a lot lately. Lots of deadlines. And people. Do you need to take it again now? Because I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress absolutely can raise your blood pressure temporarily. We'll definitely take it again, it's standard procedure. It’s good to get a baseline reading when you’re calm. And don’t worry, it won’t take long. While I do that, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on at work that’s causing you stress?
PATIENT: Ugh, where do I even start? It’s mostly… incompetence. Seriously. I’m a technician, I do things, I build things. Half the people there just… talk about doing things. And then I have to fix their mistakes. It’s a new project, a bridge extension, and the plans were… not good. I had to rewrite half of them just to get them up to code. My boss doesn't seem to notice, or care, as long as things are "moving forward." Honestly, it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly frustrating. It’s demoralizing to constantly have to pick up after others, especially when it feels like your efforts aren’t being recognized. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88 this time. Still elevated, but a little lower. We’ll want to repeat this reading a couple more times over the next few minutes to get an accurate average. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or have you ever had any other medical problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. And no, nothing else. I’m… healthy. I mean, I used to play basketball in high school. I don’t now, obviously, but… I don’t sit around all day. Look, is this going to involve medication? Because I really don't want to be on pills for something that's probably just a temporary thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication, and we certainly won’t rush into anything. We need to gather more information first. We’ll start with some basic questions about your medical history, lifestyle, and family history. Then we'll do a brief physical exam. That will help us determine the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to medications, or have you had any reactions to drugs in the past?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. And I don't take anything regularly, not even vitamins. My husband tried to get me to take some, but… I don’t need things. I eat… normal food. Not a lot of salt, I guess. He worries about that too. Can we just… skip the history part? I don’t see what it has to do with this. It's probably just stress, like I said.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so upfront, Ms. Dudney. While it could be stress, a thorough evaluation is important to rule out any other underlying causes. A family history of hypertension or heart disease can increase your risk, for example, and even things like kidney problems can affect blood pressure. It really won't take long. Let's start with your family – does anyone in your immediate family—parents, siblings—have high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My mom had… something. When she was older. I don't remember exactly. She lived far away, on the reservation, and we didn't talk about… details. And my dad… he just worked. A lot. He didn’t really go to doctors. Honestly, I don't know. I don't keep up with family medical stuff. It's not really… a priority. Can we just take another reading now? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for family medical history to be unclear. We’ll proceed with the exam, then. It’s fairly quick. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your reflexes. Then, I'd like to briefly examine your abdomen, just to make sure everything feels normal. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I have a meeting this afternoon, so I really can’t be here all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, although I do detect a faint murmur – it's likely benign, but we’ll note it. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Blood pressure is now 138/85. Still elevated, but trending down. So, Ms. Dudney, we’ve established your blood pressure is consistently above the normal range. While lifestyle factors like stress can contribute, it's important to investigate further. Have you had a recent blood test, perhaps with your primary care provider?
PATIENT: No. I don't have a primary care provider. I just go to urgent care if something's really wrong. And honestly, I haven't been to a doctor in… years. This is all a waste of time. It's just stress. I'm a perfectly healthy person. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your consistently elevated blood pressure, the lack of prior medical care, and limited family history, I'm going to recommend a few things. First, I’d like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol. We also need to rule out any secondary causes of hypertension. And I strongly advise establishing care with a primary care provider, even if you're generally healthy. I can give you a list of providers in the area. Finally, while we wait for the blood work results, I suggest monitoring your blood pressure at home. I'll give you instructions on how to do that properly. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Blood work. Whatever. But I'm not promising I'll actually go get it done. And no, I don't want a list of doctors. I'm not establishing "care" with anyone. A list of instructions for taking blood pressure at home is… acceptable. But I'm telling you, it's probably just stress. And I don't need a lecture. Can we just get this over with so I can leave?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Dudney. I understand your reluctance, but I feel it's important to address this appropriately. Here are the instructions. It's important to take it at the same time each day, and to follow the guidelines carefully. I’m also sending an electronic order to the lab for the blood work. They should contact you to schedule an appointment. I will review the results when they come back, and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… can I go now? Seriously. This has been a waste of time. I have a meeting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. I hope you’ll reconsider establishing care with a primary care provider in the future. Have a good day. .
