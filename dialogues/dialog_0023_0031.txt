DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been like this for a few days now, and I was told it might be connected to... the fluttering in my chest, you see. I know I have that, but I’m not entirely sure how it could cause my leg to swell.
DOCTOR: “Fluttering in the chest,” you say. And the swelling is localized to the left leg, has been present for a few days… Right. We'll get to the bottom of this. To clarify, is this fluttering constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Sometimes I don't notice it at all, and other times it feels... well, like a fish flopping about. It’s usually not painful, just… unsettling. And it seems to happen more when I’ve been on my feet for a long time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, though frankly, self-diagnosis is rarely accurate. "Fish flopping about"... alright. And the swelling?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my calf, I think. It’s gotten worse each day. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. And it feels a bit… heavy. I haven’t been able to wear my usual shoes, and walking is a bit difficult. I was wondering if it might be a blood clot, to be honest. I read something online… although I know you said not to self-diagnose.
DOCTOR: Online resources… yes, they can be… misleading. A blood clot is a possibility, which is why we need to properly assess this, but let's not jump to conclusions. Have you experienced any pain in your leg – beyond the discomfort of the swelling?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. It's more of an ache, really. A dull ache that gets worse if I press on it. And it feels warm to the touch, if that makes sense. I haven't noticed any redness, though. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Warm to the touch… no redness. That's... helpful. And this ache, is it constant, or does it come and go like the… fluttering?
PATIENT: It comes and goes with the swelling, Doctor. When my leg is bigger, it aches more. When it seems a little less swollen, the ache isn't as bad. I hope that makes sense. It all feels connected somehow, but I'm not a doctor, so I'm only guessing.
DOCTOR: "Connected somehow"... Right. We need to get a better look at this leg, and I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs as well. Let’s start with a physical examination. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything special I should be doing? Like, should I cross my legs or anything? I want to make this as easy as possible for you.
DOCTOR: Just relax, please. No need to complicate things. Let me examine your leg first. Please extend your left leg. I'm going to palpate it, check for pulses, and assess the range of motion. Hmm… there is some pitting edema here, and it is tender to the touch. And your pulses feel… normal, but I'll want to confirm that with a Doppler. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: It feels a bit chilly, Doctor. Is it always this cold in here? And what exactly does "pitting edema" mean? I keep hearing words I don't understand.
DOCTOR: The temperature is regulated for optimal examination conditions. And "pitting edema" simply means that fluid is accumulating in the tissues, causing swelling that leaves an indentation when you press on it—which, as I've observed, is present in your leg. It’s not a particularly concerning finding in isolation, but in conjunction with the fluttering you describe, and the fact that it's worsening, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'm going to order a D-dimer test and an EKG to get a clearer picture. Do you have any history of blood clots, or any family history of them?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any history of blood clots myself. And… as far as I know, my family doesn’t either. My grandmother had a bit of a bad heart, I think, but I don’t remember the specifics. She passed away a long time ago. Will the tests be painful? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? I have computer science class tomorrow.
DOCTOR: "A bit of a bad heart"... vague family history isn’t particularly helpful, but we’ll proceed regardless. The D-dimer is a simple blood test; you won't even feel it. The EKG involves placing a few stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity; it's also painless. Results should be back within a couple of hours, but it will depend on the lab's workload. We will review them together, and then determine the next course of action. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your left leg as much as possible, and avoiding prolonged standing. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I've never had to take much medication, thankfully. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, should I drink more water, or… anything specific to help with the swelling? And… if it gets worse before I come back, should I go to the emergency room? I worry easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, increasing your fluid intake is generally a good idea. Water helps with circulation. And yes, if the swelling increases dramatically, or you experience sudden pain, shortness of breath, or chest pain, then you should absolutely go to the emergency room. Do not hesitate. However, I do not want you self-diagnosing and panicking over every minor sensation. We have a plan in place—we will review the test results, and then determine the appropriate course of action. I'm sending the lab orders now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. In the meantime, please remain here, and try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll just… sit here and wait, then. And I will try not to worry. .
