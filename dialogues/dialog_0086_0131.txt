DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sladen, so you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s my blood pressure, you see. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister, she kept on at me to get it checked. She’s a bit of a worrier, that one! But, you know, better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your sister sounds... attentive. “A bit high” isn’t terribly specific, though. Can you give me some numbers, if you have them?
PATIENT: Numbers… hmm. I do have a little machine, my friend Carol lent me. I took it a few times this week. Let me think… Tuesday morning it was 140 over 90, I think. And then yesterday, it was 135 over 85. Something like that, anyway. I wrote it down somewhere... Ah, here it is! 142 over 92 on Tuesday, 138 over 88 yesterday. Is that… bad? I don’t really understand all that numbers stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s… elevated. Not catastrophically so, but certainly not where we want it. Do you have any symptoms when your blood pressure is high?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not really. I mean, sometimes I get a little headache, but I get those anyway, you know? Stress, probably. And maybe a little tired, but who isn’t these days? Nothing that makes me think, “Oh, it’s my blood pressure!” Honestly, I mostly found out it was high ‘cause Carol was nagging me to check it regularly. She’s got one of those fancy machines that sends everything to her doctor automatically. A bit much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good you’re being proactive, even if it’s due to… external encouragement. Let’s get a proper reading here, just to confirm. And then we’ll need to go over your medical history. Do you have any other health problems – diabetes, heart issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, Doctor. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I get a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s just getting old, I suppose! And the headaches, like I said. Nothing serious. My mom had high blood pressure too, when she got older. That's why my sister's been on me about it. She remembers. I mostly just eat regular food and try to keep moving. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis, sometimes. It’s called… um… Naproxen? Yeah, that’s it. But I don't take it every day, just when my hands are really bothering me. And I take a multivitamin, does that count? Nothing else, I promise. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your pulse and do a quick exam. It’s standard procedure. Please sit up on the table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I always feel a little silly doing this, but I know it's important. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. And, um, is my sister right to be worried, do you think?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a little forceful. Pulse is 78, steady. 145 over 90. As for your sister... it’s good to be aware, certainly. Your readings are consistently elevated, and your family history is a factor. It’s not an emergency, but it does warrant attention. We need to rule out any underlying causes and see if we can get this under control before it becomes a problem. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? No, I don’t smoke, never have. Tried it once when I was a teenager, but it made me cough something awful. And I barely drink, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, on a special occasion. My sister always tells me I’m too sensible, if you can believe it! I do like a little sweet treat sometimes, though… a slice of rum cake, maybe. Does that count? Is that bad for blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Rum cake… isn’t ideal, no. We’ll discuss diet later. Now, let’s talk about exercise. How active are you, generally?
PATIENT: Well, I walk a bit. I walk to the shop most days to get groceries, and I do a little gardening. Nothing strenuous, mind you. Just weeding and watering, things like that. I used to go to a dance class, but I haven’t been in a while. Life just gets in the way, you know? It's a bit of a long walk to get there, and sometimes my hands are too sore. But I try to keep moving, I really do. I don't like sitting around all day. Does that sound like enough?
DOCTOR: It's… a start. But given your blood pressure and family history, we need to increase your activity level, and consider medication to help get things under control. We’ll do some blood work to rule out any secondary causes – kidney problems, thyroid issues – and then discuss options. Let’s start with the blood draw. I'll write you a requisition form.
PATIENT: Oh. Medication already? That sounds a bit serious, doesn't it? Is it really necessary? Maybe if I just walk a bit more and cut back on the rum cake... And what kind of blood work? Lots of needles? I'm not a big fan of needles, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, your blood pressure is consistently elevated, despite your efforts. We aren't at a crisis point, but ignoring it won't make it go away. Medication isn't necessarily permanent. It may allow us to manage it while you make lifestyle changes, and then we can reassess. As for the blood work, it’s standard procedure. A few vials. Yes, there will be needles. But it’s necessary to determine the cause of your elevated pressure and rule out other underlying issues. It’s a small discomfort for a lot of information. Take this to the lab. They're just down the hall. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Right. Will it hurt a lot? And what exactly are they looking for? You said... kidney problems? Is that serious? And...what if I don't want to take medication? Could I just… try really hard to walk more? I really don't like taking pills, Doctor. It just makes me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, the blood draw is a minor discomfort. A brief pinch. As for "trying harder"... we've discussed this. Your blood pressure is consistently elevated, despite your current efforts. It’s not simply a matter of willpower. As for the tests... they are to rule out serious causes, yes, but it’s standard protocol. It’s prudent. The medication is a possibility, not a requirement. But we need information first. Look, go to the lab. Get the blood work done. Then we can discuss your options, based on the results. I have other patients waiting. .
