DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ Doctor Pitmon. Just call me Venna, please. Well, my blood pressure’s been actin’ up lately. The numbers just ain’t right when I check ‘em at home. That’s what the nice lady at the pharmacy said, anyway. She told me to come get it looked at.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. “Actin’ up” is a bit vague, though. Can you tell me specifically what those numbers have been reading lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I try not to worry too much with ‘em, if I’m bein’ honest. I mostly just see if they’re red or green on that machine. But… I think the top one was around 150 the last time, maybe higher? And the bottom one… somethin’ in the 90s, I reckon. It’s all a blur, really. I don’t remember exactly. It was a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Hmm. 150 over 90 is… elevated, yes. We’ll need to get a better reading here in the office, just to confirm. Now, are you experiencing any symptoms with this higher blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feelin’ sick? Not really sick, no. Sometimes my head feels a little… full. Like when you’ve been in the sun too long, maybe? And I get kinda tired easier, I suppose. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I'm supposed to be tired. It’s hard to say what’s the pressure and what’s just… me.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Well, a headache and fatigue can be associated with hypertension, but as you say, they can also be due to other things. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we'll check your blood pressure again. Have you been taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things, regularly?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands. It’s… I think it’s called ibuprofen? The white pills. And sometimes a little somethin’ for sleep, when I can’t get to restin’. Not every night, though. Just when I really need it. My daughter brings it for me, mostly. I don’t always remember the names.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and something for sleep. We’ll need to get a list of those exact medications, if possible. Ibuprofen can sometimes raise blood pressure, actually, so that’s good to know. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your pulse. Can you roll up your sleeve for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Here. My daughter always says I gotta be more careful with what I take. She worries somethin’ fierce. She’s a good girl. I just forget so easy these days. It’s like tryin’ to hold water in your hands, you know? Slippin’ away before you know it.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not particularly concerning at this point, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Pulse is… 78 and a little weak. Alright, now let's get your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Okay, relax… I’m tryin’. It always makes me nervous when someone messes with my arm like that. Feels kinda tight. My blood pressure’s always higher at the doctor’s office, I swear. It's the white coat effect, my sister used to call it. She was a nurse, you know. Real good one.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it is a bit elevated here – 162 over 94. As you said, it's often higher in the office, but this is still a bit concerning. I want to run a few simple blood tests, just to get a better overall picture. We’ll check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a basic metabolic panel. Also, I’m going to order an EKG, just to look at your heart rhythm. It's standard procedure when we're investigating high blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, I reckon I can manage it. I just don’t want a lot of pokin’ and proddin’. My skin’s kinda thin, you know. Will it hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I got a pie crust started I need to get to. Apple. My grandkids love it. .
DOCTOR: It won’t be much pokin’ and proddin’, Venna. Just a standard blood draw, and the EKG is just stickers on your chest. As for your pie crust, we can usually get the results back within a few days. We’ll call you with the results, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a low-sodium diet and encourage you to get some gentle exercise, if you're able. Nothing strenuous, just a short walk each day. And, honestly, I want you to write down everything you’re taking, even vitamins and over-the-counter medications. It’s crucial we have a complete list. Does that sound doable?
