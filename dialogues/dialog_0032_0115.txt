DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my skin, you see. It’s turned rather… yellow. A bit unsettling, really. I believe it has something to do with my liver, the doctor I saw before mentioned something about that… hepatitis, was it? It’s all a bit hazy, honestly. I just want it to stop being yellow, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Yellowing of the skin – what we call jaundice – can certainly be concerning. And it's good you recall a previous doctor mentioning the liver; that's a helpful starting point. Hepatitis could be a cause, as you said. To clarify, Ms. Durig, do you remember when you saw this previous doctor, and what, if any, tests were done at that time?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when was that? It feels like… a very long time ago. Perhaps… two, maybe three years? It was before… well, before everything got so difficult. Tests… I’m afraid I don’t recall precisely which tests. Just that they poked me a bit. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is it alright if I don’t remember all the details? It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. Memory lapses are perfectly understandable, especially with time. We'll do our best to piece things together. So, this yellowing... has it been present for the same two to three years, or is it a more recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, definitely more recent. It started… well, I’d say within the last few months. It was barely noticeable at first, just a slight tinge. But now… now it’s quite prominent. It's worried me quite a bit, I must say. I’ve been feeling rather tired as well, though that could be just… old age. Everything aches these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the jaundice has progressed over the last few months, accompanied by fatigue. And you've noticed generalized aches as well. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… aches, fatigue, yellow skin… Oh! Yes, my stomach has been a bit… upset. Not constantly, but frequently. And I’ve lost my appetite, haven't been eating much lately. Everything tastes rather… bland. Is that important? I don't want to bother you with insignificant details.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Durig, that's not insignificant at all. Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite are certainly relevant. And the change in taste perception is something we should investigate. Now, could you describe this abdominal discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. It’s higher up, on my right side, I believe. It comes and goes, really. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times it’s just… bothersome. And it feels… full? Even when I haven’t eaten much. Does that make any sense? I'm afraid I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. You're describing it just fine. Right upper quadrant pain and a sensation of fullness, along with the other symptoms you've mentioned, does give us some direction. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination, if you don't mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen, pressing gently on your belly, and checking your skin and eyes more closely. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please? I’m a bit… fragile these days. And if it becomes too uncomfortable, please do let me know. I don't want to cause any fuss.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. We'll proceed as gently as possible. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, that would be wonderful. Alright. I'm listening to your abdomen now… and palpating… There is some tenderness in the right upper quadrant, as you described. No guarding or rebound tenderness at this time. The liver feels slightly enlarged and firm. I'll also check your sclera now… Yes, there is definite jaundice visible in the sclera – the whites of your eyes. Now, let's check your skin tone more closely. Skin tone is also jaundiced. No obvious signs of bruising or lesions. I'm also noting some mild edema in your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Oh… edema, you say? Is that… serious? Everything sounds so… concerning. I just want to know what’s wrong with me, Doctor. Is it the hepatitis? Is that what’s causing all of this? I understand you need to run tests, but could you… perhaps give me a preliminary idea? I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. And I don’t have much family to help me through this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, I understand your anxiety, but it's premature to draw any conclusions at this stage. While your previous doctor mentioned hepatitis, many conditions can cause jaundice, edema, and abdominal discomfort. We need to run some blood tests to assess your liver function, check for infection, and rule out other possibilities. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, a bilirubin panel, and a coagulation panel. We will also need a urine analysis. I’m also noting that, given your age and presentation, we should also consider an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer view of your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. This is a standard workup for these symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye that I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I haven’t taken much medication in years, to be honest. Perhaps… a slight rash once, from an antibiotic many years ago? But it wasn't very serious. And contrast dye… I haven't had any imaging done in a very long time. No, I don't recall any allergies to that either. I hope these tests aren't too… unpleasant? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. .
DOCTOR: Very well. A mild rash in the past is noted. We’ll proceed with the standard precautions. The blood tests should be processed within a day or two, and the ultrasound can usually be scheduled within the next week. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the appropriate course of action. In the meantime, I would advise you to maintain a light diet, avoid alcohol, and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – severe abdominal pain, fever, dark urine, pale stools – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Durig?
