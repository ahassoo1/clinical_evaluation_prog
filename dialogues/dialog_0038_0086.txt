DOCTOR: Hello Kahrin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just here for the results, you said? I’m Kahrin, by the way. Really hoping it’s nothing too bad, honestly. I’m trying to get back to work, so the quicker we can go over it, the better.
DOCTOR: Right, Kahrin, of course. And please, call me Neeraj. I understand you’re eager to get back to work, and we’ll definitely try to be as efficient as possible. Let me pull up your results here… Just to confirm, those are for the blood tests and urine sample we took last week, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Blood and… the other one. Last Tuesday, I think it was? Look, I don’t really remember all the specifics, just that I needed to get it done. Is everything okay? You’re looking a little… serious.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, last Tuesday. No worries at all about the specifics. Okay, so, the results came back a little… unusual. Your white blood cell count is elevated, and there’s some protein in your urine. Now, these things can be caused by a lot of different things, from a simple infection to something a bit more complex. Before we jump to any conclusions, I’m going to ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… “unusual” doesn’t sound great. But yeah, questions are fine. Just… try to keep it brief, if you don’t mind? I have a shipment schedule to reorganize. What kind of questions are we talking? Is it about, like, symptoms? Because honestly, I haven’t felt sick.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand wanting to be brief. We'll focus on the important things. And good that you haven't been feeling unwell, that's helpful. Let's start with the history of present illness – HPI, as we call it. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Chills, not really. Maybe a little cold a couple of weeks back, but nothing major. Night sweats… hmm. I do sometimes wake up a bit warm, but I live in Tahiti, Doctor. It’s pretty humid. Is that what you mean? I’m not usually drenched or anything. Do you need me to be more specific?
DOCTOR: Right, Tahiti, humidity… that's good context, thank you. No, no need for drenched, just wondering if you've noticed any increase in sweating at night compared to usual. Okay, so no significant fever, chills, or increased night sweats. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, frequency, or any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Okay, good. No to all of that, actually. Color’s normal, smells normal – as normal as urine smells, I guess. Frequency is… usual. And no pain. I mean, it's pee, Doctor. It doesn't usually hurt. Look, I'm a logistician, not a medical professional. Are we getting somewhere, or…? I’m just worried about what this means for work.
DOCTOR: Right, I apologize if the questions seem a bit basic, Kahrin. It’s important to cover all bases. And I appreciate your patience. No changes in urine, that’s good. Now, let’s move on to any other symptoms. Have you experienced any fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, skin rashes, or unexplained weight loss in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Fatigue… yeah, a little. But I’ve been working long hours trying to cover for someone who called out. So, probably just that. Muscle aches… sometimes, after lifting things at the warehouse. Joint pain, no. Skin rashes, definitely not. And weight loss? No, if anything I've probably gained a few pounds with all the takeout lately. Is this elevated white blood cell count a big deal? Honestly, just tell me if I need to see a specialist.
DOCTOR: Right, okay, that's helpful information. Fatigue likely related to work, muscle aches from lifting, no other significant symptoms. An elevated white blood cell count can indicate a number of things, Kahrin, from a simple infection to something more complex like an inflammatory condition. It's not necessarily a big deal, but we need to investigate further. Given your results and the fact that you’re feeling generally well, I think it's best to start with a more detailed review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing ever. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. Just the usual colds and stuff. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, no major injuries. My mom had high blood pressure, but that's it. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I have to. This is… stressful. Can we speed this up a bit? I have a shipment coming in tomorrow and I need to finalize the route.
DOCTOR: Right, okay, no prior medical conditions, family history of high blood pressure only. I understand your stress and will try to be as efficient as possible. Alright, let's quickly go through allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I can eat anything. No reactions to anything I know of. And I don't take any medications. Not even vitamins. I’m really trying to figure out if I need to call in sick. Is this something I should be worried about right now? Like, contagious?
DOCTOR: Right, no allergies or medications. That's good to know. And regarding your concern about contagiousness, it’s unlikely at this stage, but we can't rule it out completely until we have a better understanding of what's going on. Given the elevated white blood cell count and protein in your urine, and the fact that you’re otherwise feeling well, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. A quick one though, please? I really need to get back to work. Heart and lungs… okay. But seriously, if it's just a minor infection, can I get a prescription or something? I don’t have time for a long investigation. I have people relying on me.
DOCTOR: Right, a quick exam, I understand. If you could just have a seat here, please. I'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6, and your respiratory rate is 16. Everything looks normal so far. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs… Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear… No wheezing or crackles. Okay, everything sounds normal on the physical exam, which is reassuring.
PATIENT: Okay, good. "Reassuring" is good. So… what now? Can we at least rule out anything serious? I mean, I’m a logistician, not a hypochondriac. Is it a virus? Do I need to quarantine? Just give it to me straight, Doctor. I need to make some decisions.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand your need for a clear answer. The fact that your physical exam is normal does rule out some of the more serious possibilities, but it doesn't tell us the cause of the elevated white blood cell count and protein in your urine. It could be a mild viral infection, although you haven't exhibited any typical symptoms. It could also be a urinary tract infection, even without pain. To get a definitive answer, I would recommend a urine culture to check for bacteria, and a repeat blood test in a week to see if the white blood cell count has normalized. However, given your situation and concern about work, and the fact that you're feeling well, we can take a “wait and see” approach for now. I’m going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic as a precaution, in case it is a mild urinary tract infection. It's better to be safe than sorry. But if your symptoms worsen – fever, chills, pain when urinating, fatigue – you need to see me immediately. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Ugh, antibiotics… okay, fine. A “wait and see” approach sounds… less stressful. So, I take the pills, and if I feel worse, I call? And if I don't, I just… go back to work? Is there anything I should avoid doing? Lifting heavy things? Traveling? Honestly, just tell me if I need to reorganize my entire schedule.
DOCTOR: Right, you take the antibiotics as prescribed, and if your symptoms worsen, you call immediately. If you don't feel worse, continue with your normal activities, but be mindful of your body. I wouldn't advise any strenuous activity – heavy lifting, long hours – until we have the results of the repeat blood test. And if you start to experience any new symptoms, like fever, chills, or flank pain, please come back immediately. For now, try to get some rest when you can and stay hydrated. Here’s the prescription for the antibiotic. It's a 7-day course. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to repeat the blood test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Seven days of pills. Follow-up next week. No heavy lifting. I guess that's… manageable. Is there anything else? Honestly, I'm trying to get back to work. I don't want to waste any more time. Can I just… go now?
DOCTOR: Right. No, that's everything for now. I've documented everything in your chart and scheduled your follow-up appointment. Here’s a summary of the visit, including the prescription information and follow-up appointment details. Yes, you're free to go. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if your symptoms worsen, come back immediately. Get well soon, Kahrin, and try not to stress too much. I hope you get back to work quickly.
