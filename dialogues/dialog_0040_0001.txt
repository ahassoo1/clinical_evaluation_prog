DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch, good to see you, I suppose. Let’s not waste time, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I appreciate that. I… I understand you help people stop smoking? It’s been… a long time. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I’ve seen a lot of smokers in my time. “Long time” doesn't really tell me anything useful. How many packs a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Forgive me, Doctor. About… two. Two packs a day, for… well, since I was seventeen. That would be… fifty-eight years. Does that help? I always kept track, oddly enough. It was… a habit. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Fifty-eight years… remarkable. And have you tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many times. Patches, gum… even one of those… hypnotist things. Nothing stuck. I’d get… irritable. Very irritable. And then… start again. My brother, he quit cold turkey. But I… I don’t have his willpower, I suppose. It's a foolish habit, really.
DOCTOR: "Foolish" is putting it mildly. Irritability is… common. We need to get a baseline, though. Any coughing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A bit. Not… terrible. Mostly in the mornings. It’s… a smoker’s cough, I expect. Always have, really. Since… well, shortly after I started smoking, actually. It hasn’t gotten much worse, thankfully. Though my wife… she used to complain about it, waking her up. But that was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Right. And any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Not… regularly. Walking up the stairs… sometimes I have to pause for a bit. But I’ve always been… a bit out of shape, if I’m honest. Though, I did enjoy a good walk when I was younger. Before… everything. It’s probably just my age, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright, let’s have a listen to your lungs. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… again… Alright. A little bit of wheezing, as expected. Not alarming, but we’ll need to keep an eye on it. Any other health problems I should know about?
PATIENT: Just… my knees, Doctor. Arthritis, they say. Makes it hard to… well, to do much walking, as I mentioned. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, obviously. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been a fairly… resilient man, I think. Until this smoking, of course.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, eyesight… typical for your age. Do you take any medications for these, or anything at all, regularly?
PATIENT: Just… ibuprofen, when my knees act up. Nothing… prescribed. I try not to take too much. It doesn’t seem to do much good anyway. And… occasionally, some eye drops. For the dryness. That’s all, Doctor. Really. I try to avoid pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Knoch, based on what you've told me…and frankly, I’ve heard this story a thousand times…you’ve got a long-standing smoking habit with some expected age-related issues. We can try medication, but given your… aversion to pills, I don't have high hopes. Honestly, the best thing you could do is just stop. But that’s clearly easier said than done. I’m not going to waste your time with a detailed plan if you aren’t truly committed. Do you want me to write you a prescription for something, or shall we just leave it at that?
PATIENT: Doctor, I wouldn't be here if I didn't… want to stop. It’s… it’s been a long time, yes. And difficult. But I do want to stop. Perhaps… perhaps something to help with the irritability? Just… something to take the edge off? I don't need a miracle, just… a little help. And… and I'll try, Doctor. I promise. I’ll really try.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m writing you a prescription for a low-dose nicotine replacement therapy. It’s not a magic bullet, and it won’t do the work for you. Follow the instructions exactly. And if you relapse… don't bother coming back. I have other patients to see. Here. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That… that will be enough. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time… and the prescription. I will… I will follow the instructions carefully. And… and I'll do my best. Thank you again. .
