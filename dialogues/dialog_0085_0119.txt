DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s rather…uncomfortable to discuss, frankly. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It’s…a discharge. A male discharge. My…associate is experiencing it. It's quite upsetting, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is concerning when something unexpected happens. To clarify, you said your “associate” is experiencing a discharge. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must we be so…graphic? It’s coming from…down there. It’s not normal, that much is certain. A bit yellowish, if I’m being precise. And there’s…an odour. Not pleasant, I assure you. He’s usually quite meticulous, you understand. This is…out of character.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem graphic, Jinnie. It's important to gather accurate information to understand what’s happening. And you're right to be concerned about a change in discharge, especially with an odor. To help me figure out what might be going on, could you tell me how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it’s been… perhaps three or four days now? It started rather subtly, I thought it was just…a bit of dampness. But it’s gotten progressively worse. He hasn’t mentioned it, of course. Men are notoriously…unobservant. I noticed it when changing the linens, naturally. I do all the housework, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four days. And you noticed it yourself. Has he experienced any other symptoms along with this discharge – any pain, burning when he urinates, or fever, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, he has been a bit… irritable lately. More so than usual. And he complained of a slight ache, lower back, he said. But he puts that down to gardening. He's always digging around in the dirt. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know if that’s relevant. He’s a very… stoic man. Doesn't complain easily.
DOCTOR: It is helpful information, Jinnie. Any change in behavior or pain, even if he attributes it to something else, can be important. Now, has he had anything like this happen before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. He's a very… respectable man. Always careful. This is quite out of the question. He wouldn't… well, he wouldn't get anything like that. He’s been with the same… companion… for a very long time. It must be something… temporary. Perhaps a bit of irritation from his gardening trousers? They're rather rough, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, could you tell me about any allergies he has, or any medications he’s currently taking?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, he's allergic to dust, doesn't everyone get a bit sneezy with dust? And… let me think. He takes a little something for his waterworks, you know, the usual for older men. I believe it's… Flomax, yes, that’s it. And sometimes, a painkiller for his back, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think. He's not one for taking a lot of medication, mind you. Very self-reliant. He hates going to doctors, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Flomax for his waterworks and Ibuprofen as needed for back pain, and a dust allergy. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will help me to get a better understanding of what might be going on. This will involve checking his temperature, pulse, and listening to his heart and lungs, and I will also need to examine the area where the discharge is coming from. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Examine… down there? That sounds… rather intrusive. I don’t know if that’s necessary, Doctor. Couldn’t you just… prescribe something? An ointment, perhaps? He'd be terribly embarrassed. I'm not certain he'd approve of a stranger… poking around. Honestly, it all seems a bit excessive for a bit of… discharge. Perhaps it will clear up on its own?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jinnie, and I want to assure you I will be as respectful and discreet as possible. However, to accurately determine the cause of the discharge and ensure we’re providing the appropriate treatment, a physical exam is really the best course of action. It could be something simple, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. Without an exam, I would be guessing, and that wouldn’t be responsible medical care. We can keep the exam focused and brief. If you’re still uncomfortable, we could start with a urine sample to check for infection, but even that wouldn’t give us a complete picture. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A urine sample… yes, that sounds… less objectionable. He can manage that himself, I suppose. He’s quite capable. But I still maintain this is all rather unnecessary. Honestly, Doctor, men get all sorts of…little ailments. It’s usually nothing serious. But a urine sample… fine. Let’s start with that. But I'm warning you, if this turns into a lengthy ordeal, I’ll be very displeased.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. A urine sample is a good starting point. I’ll have a nurse bring in a collection cup and instructions. He’ll need to clean the area first, and then collect a midstream sample. Do you know where the restroom is located?
PATIENT: Of course, I do. It’s down the hall, to the left. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite capable of navigating a simple hallway. Just…please don’t make a fuss. He’s a proud man, you know. This is already quite humiliating enough for him. Just get the sample and…be done with it. I’m sure it’s nothing more than a bit of irritation. A touch of dust, perhaps. Or…gardening. Yes, gardening. That’s likely it.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. I’ll let the nurse know to bring the cup right away. Please let me know if you need anything at all. I’ll be just outside if you have any questions.
