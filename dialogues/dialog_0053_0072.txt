DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Heidenthal. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, it’s my memory. It’s just… not what it used to be. Little things, mostly. I forget where I put things, sometimes I have trouble remembering what I had for breakfast… that kind of stuff. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. “Little things,” you say. And when did you first start noticing these… lapses?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Probably… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. At first I just thought I was stressed, you know? Work’s been busy. But it hasn’t really gotten better, and now I'm starting to feel a bit… off. It's not like, forgetting big things, but… it's enough to make me wonder.
DOCTOR: Right. And can you be more specific about the "little things?
PATIENT: Well, like yesterday, I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for! I just… wandered around for ages. And then I got home and realized I needed milk, but I'd already been home! It’s things like that. Also, sometimes I have trouble remembering the names of people I’ve met recently. Not all the time, but often enough that it’s noticeable. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: So, forgetfulness and some difficulty with recalling names… Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think so, yeah. It’s harder to focus at work sometimes. I find myself rereading things more than once, or getting distracted easily. I just chalked it up to being tired, but maybe it’s related? I do a lot of detail work as a dentist, so needing to refocus is… not great. It slows me down.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any headaches or dizziness. No trouble sleeping, and my vision’s fine. I mean, I’m a dentist, I check that regularly! I just feel… a bit foggy sometimes, if that makes sense? Like my brain isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. I try to avoid medication whenever possible, honestly. I have no allergies that I know of either. I'm generally pretty healthy, I think. That’s why this whole memory thing is so worrying!
DOCTOR: Right. Do you have any family history of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had Alzheimer's, I think. It was quite a long time ago, and I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a lot of details. But my mother always said it ran in the family. Other than that, not really. My father was perfectly healthy until… well, until he wasn’t, but that was just old age, I think. Nothing neurological.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how would you describe your typical diet and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I don’t really eat a lot of processed food. I'm not a huge sweets person. As for lifestyle… I work a lot. Long hours at the practice. I try to exercise when I can – mostly walking, or yoga. I don’t drink a lot of alcohol, and I don’t smoke. I guess… pretty normal. I wish I had more time for hobbies, but… work always comes first.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Let’s do a quick cognitive assessment. Just a few simple tests to get a baseline. It won’t be anything too strenuous. We’ll start with a memory recall test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me immediately, and then again in about five minutes. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds fine. Five minutes, right? Okay, I’m ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: apple… table… penny. Please repeat them back to me now.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Got it. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll move on to a few other tests, and then we'll get back to those words in about five minutes. Now, I'm going to ask you to perform a simple calculation. What is 7 times 9?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. 7 times 9… That’s… 63. Is that right? I used to be so good at math!
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you spell the word "world" backwards?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… let me see… d-l-r-o-w? Is that right? It feels wrong somehow. I haven't had to spell backwards in years!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Let's take a brief break from the mental exercises. Now I'm going to perform a quick physical exam. Just a standard neurological assessment. I’ll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that okay? I have pretty good eye-hand coordination, from being a dentist. Hopefully that helps.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, please close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers. Okay, now I'm going to test your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. No obvious deficits in coordination or balance observed. Now, can you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It’s a bit wobbly, but I think I did okay. It's harder than it looks! I do this all day at work, but not like this.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, please have a seat. Now, let’s return to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them for me?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… Apple… and… table… Oh dear. I’m blanking on the third one. It was something… round? No, that doesn’t sound right. I'm so sorry, I just can't remember it. I feel terrible. It was right there a few minutes ago!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Based on your history, the physical exam, and the cognitive assessment, there are some concerning signs. While it's not definitive, your report of memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and the results of the immediate recall test are suggestive of mild cognitive impairment. It’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I will order some blood work to assess your overall health and thyroid function. I would also like to schedule you for a more comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation with a specialist. This will give us a more detailed understanding of your cognitive abilities and help determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That… sounds a bit scary, honestly. Mild cognitive impairment… is that… serious? And a neuropsychological evaluation… what does that involve? I suppose if it helps figure things out, then yes, that sounds acceptable. I just… I'm a bit overwhelmed. Blood work and a specialist… it's a lot. Is there anything I can do right now? Anything to help improve my memory?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Heidenthal. "Mild cognitive impairment" simply means there’s been a noticeable decline in cognitive function that doesn’t significantly interfere with daily life yet. It doesn’t automatically mean you’re developing dementia, but it does warrant further investigation. As for what you can do right now, there are some lifestyle modifications that can potentially help. Maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep are crucial. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as puzzles, reading, or learning a new skill, can also be beneficial. Social interaction is important too – staying connected with friends and family can help keep your mind active. I will write you a referral to a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. They’ll be able to perform the neuropsychological evaluation. In the meantime, I’ll order the blood work. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. And I’ll provide you with a list of resources for cognitive health. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay. That makes… a little more sense. Puzzles and reading… I can definitely do that. I think. I suppose staying social is good, even if I am a bit of a workaholic. The neurologist… is that going to be a long wait? And the blood work… is it a lot? I appreciate you explaining everything. It just feels… unsettling, you know? To think something might be changing.
DOCTOR: It is unsettling, Ms. Heidenthal. And you’re right to ask. The wait for the neurologist can be a few weeks, unfortunately. I will put in a rush request, but it depends on their availability. The office will contact you to schedule an appointment once they have an opening. As for the blood work, it’s a standard panel. Just a few vials of blood. It will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other markers to rule out any underlying medical causes. The phlebotomist will explain everything before they draw the blood. It shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. I'll print out the referral information and the blood work requisition now. I also have some pamphlets on cognitive health and memory strategies. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns between now and your appointments. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Pitmon. You’ve been very helpful, and… reassuring, actually. I still feel anxious, but I feel better knowing there’s a plan. I'll try to stay positive and do the puzzles. And I'll let the office know if I have any questions. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Take care. The office will be in touch. .
