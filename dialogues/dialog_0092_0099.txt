DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Giganti. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe they called it an “endo” test? And it wasn’t quite right, according to the office. That’s why I’m here. I was hoping you could explain what it means.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. An “endo” test, you likely mean an endoscopy. It involves looking inside your digestive tract. I can definitely review those results with you. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little bit more about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, endoscopy. That was the word. Well, for some time now – perhaps six months or so – I’ve been having a bit of trouble with my stomach. Not pain, exactly, but… discomfort. And sometimes a feeling of fullness even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s been… unsettling. The doctor I saw previously thought it best to look inside, just to be certain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Discomfort and early fullness can be quite concerning. Six months is a significant amount of time, so it’s good you followed up. And you mentioned the doctor ordered an endoscopy – did they give you any preliminary thoughts on what might be causing this?
PATIENT: He… he didn’t say specifically. He mentioned several possibilities, something about acid, or perhaps an irritation? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. He used a lot of… technical terms. He simply said the endoscopy would help him see what was going on and then he’d know more. That’s why I’m relying on you to explain these results. I do remember him saying not to worry too much, but naturally, one does worry when something is found.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Minatra. It’s common to feel anxious when you receive results you don't fully understand, especially when medical terminology is involved. It sounds like the initial workup was to rule out more serious issues. Let me access those results now. Just one moment... Ah, here we are. It appears the endoscopy revealed some inflammation in your esophagus and stomach. The report also mentions some evidence of gastritis and esophagitis. Have you heard of those terms?
PATIENT: Gastritis… esophagitis… no, I haven't. They don't sound pleasant, I must say. Inflammation… is that… serious? Is that why I’ve been feeling so full, even after a small meal? And what causes inflammation in those parts of… well, inside me? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just want to understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: You have every right to ask questions, Ms. Minatra. It’s my job to explain things clearly. Inflammation is essentially your body's response to irritation. In your case, the inflammation in your esophagus and stomach is causing discomfort and can definitely contribute to that feeling of fullness. Think of it like a raw patch on your skin – it’s uncomfortable and doesn’t stretch easily. There are several potential causes. Common ones include acid reflux – where stomach acid backs up into the esophagus – or an infection with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, often shortened to H. pylori. Less commonly, it can be caused by certain medications or even stress. Do you experience any heartburn or indigestion after eating?
PATIENT: Heartburn… yes, sometimes. Not terribly often, perhaps once or twice a week. It’s a… burning sensation, of course, right here . And I do find that certain foods seem to aggravate it – spicy things, or anything too acidic, like tomatoes. As for stress… well, Doctor, who doesn’t experience stress these days? My husband passed away five years ago, and while I manage, there are certainly times when I feel… overwhelmed. Could that be a factor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Minatra. The occasional heartburn, particularly with certain foods, certainly points towards acid reflux as a potential contributor. And yes, stress can absolutely play a role in digestive issues. It can increase stomach acid production and affect the normal functioning of your digestive system. Now, the report doesn't mention whether they tested for H. pylori during the endoscopy. It’s a relatively simple test, usually done with a breath test or a stool sample. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a test for H. pylori. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help determine the cause, then please do. A breath test or a stool sample… honestly, either is fine. I trust your judgement. And… what happens if it is this H. pylori? Is it… serious? And is it treatable? I apologize for all the questions, but I would rather be informed.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Minatra. It’s good that you're advocating for your health. H. pylori is a common infection, and thankfully, it's very treatable. Usually, we treat it with a course of antibiotics combined with a medication to reduce stomach acid. The treatment course is typically 10 to 14 days. If it’s not H. pylori, then we'll focus on managing the inflammation through lifestyle modifications – such as avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller meals, and elevating the head of your bed to help with acid reflux – and potentially using medications to reduce stomach acid production. Before we proceed with the H. pylori test, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any ulcers or bleeding in your stomach or intestines?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Never any ulcers, or bleeding, as far as I know. I’ve had a fairly healthy life, all things considered. Aside from some arthritis in my knees, I haven't had many serious health problems. My previous doctor did prescribe me a medication for the arthritis, a white pill… I can’t recall the name, unfortunately. And I did take antacids occasionally for the heartburn, but nothing regularly. Is that information helpful? I do take a daily vitamin as well, a multi-vitamin.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Minatra. Knowing about the arthritis medication is important, as some can irritate the stomach. And the occasional antacids give us a baseline. Alright. To summarize, we’re going to order a test for H. pylori. I’ll also write a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor – that’s a medication to reduce stomach acid – to help manage your symptoms while we await the test results. I’d also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks to discuss the results and create a more comprehensive plan. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A test for H. pylori, medication to help with the acid, and a follow-up appointment in two weeks. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease. And… where will I take this test? And will someone from the office contact me to schedule the follow-up?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. My pleasure. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. The H. pylori test can be done here at the clinic. We'll have you provide a stool sample. The nurse will give you specific instructions on how to collect it when you check out. It’s a very straightforward process. And yes, someone from the office will contact you within the next few business days to schedule your follow-up appointment. They’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the appointment, if necessary. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been very kind and patient with all my questions. I truly appreciate your thorough explanation and your calm demeanor. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. It was my pleasure to meet you. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
