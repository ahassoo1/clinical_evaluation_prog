DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my nose, it is… bothering me. A problem with my sinuses, I think. It has been… a while now. Not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sinus problem. I understand. And when you say “a while now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. It is hard to say, Doctor. Maybe… two, three months? It comes and goes. Some days okay, some days… not so good. I work outside, you know? Maybe the dust? I don’t remember exactly when it started. It is just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, two or three months of intermittent sinus issues. And you suspect it might be related to your work outdoors and dust exposure. That's helpful to know. Could you describe what "not so good" feels like?
PATIENT: It is… pressure. Right here. And… sometimes hard to breathe. Not always, but… when I bend over, it feels worse. And a little bit of headache, too. Not a bad headache, just… there. Like a weight. It is hard to explain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pressure in your sinuses, difficulty breathing that worsens when you bend over, and a mild headache. That does sound frustrating. And you’ve noticed it’s been happening for about two to three months. Have you had any other symptoms along with that – things like fever, facial pain, thick nasal discharge, or a cough?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. No cough. Um… maybe some… stuffy nose? Yes, very stuffy nose. And sometimes… a little tired. But I work hard, you know? So, I am always a little tired. Facial pain… not really pain, just… pressure. Like a full feeling. I don’t know if that makes sense, Doctor? Everything is just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mikeisha. You’re describing pressure, nasal congestion, some fatigue, and a general feeling of fullness. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with sinusitis, possibly triggered by your work environment. Before we go further, let’s quickly review some other things. Do you have any allergies that you know of – to pollen, dust mites, animals, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, Doctor. I don’t think so. Never been told I have allergies. I live outside, you know? Dust, plants… always around. Never bothered me before, not that I remember. My husband, he has some, but not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that – in the past few months?
PATIENT: Illnesses… hmm. I had a little… sniffle, maybe a month ago? Just a little one. Nothing bad. I took some… medicine, the kind you get at the store. It went away pretty fast. Not like this. This is… longer. More… annoying. I don’t remember much else, Doctor. Everything is… a little blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, a mild cold about a month ago that resolved quickly. And this sinus issue has persisted for two to three months. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like asthma, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… no, Doctor. Nothing like that. I have always been… healthy. I work hard, eat good food. Never been to the doctor much. Just… check-ups, sometimes. My husband takes care of things like that, usually. I don’t remember any… diagnoses. Nothing serious, anyway. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I try to stay out of trouble, you know? Just… work. Family. That’s all. Nothing serious ever happened, not that I remember. I am… a simple woman. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mikeisha. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. And thinking about your family, does anyone in your family have a history of sinus problems, allergies, or asthma?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had… a little cough sometimes. Not asthma, I don’t think. Just a little cough. My husband’s mother, she has… allergies, maybe? To flowers, I think. She sneezes a lot. But nobody… serious. Nobody with problems like me. Just… little things. I don’t remember much about it, Doctor. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild cough in your mother and allergies in your husband’s mother. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just… sometimes, for a headache. The kind you get at the store. Ibuprofen, maybe? And… sometimes a little something for my stomach. But not every day. And… vitamins, sometimes. My husband buys them. But I don’t remember what kind. Just… general vitamins, I think. Nothing special. I don’t take much, Doctor. I prefer to eat good food.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ibuprofen for headaches, something for your stomach when needed, and general vitamins. Just to confirm, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies to… anything, not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to medicine. I just… don’t take much, you know? I try to avoid it if I can. It makes me feel… funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. Now, before I do a quick exam, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Work… I work… with the drills. Oil and gas. Rotary drills, yes. Outside, mostly. It is… hard work. A lot of dust, a lot of noise. But… it is good work. I like working with my hands. I have been doing it for… a long time now. Maybe fifteen years? I don’t remember exactly. It is… a good job, Doctor. But… dusty. Very dusty.
DOCTOR: Okay, you work with oil and gas rotary drills outdoors for about fifteen years and it is a dusty environment. That’s very helpful. Alright, Mikeisha. I’m going to listen to your lungs and sinuses, and then I’ll take a look at your nose and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want this… pressure to go away. It is… annoying. Do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and again… good. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let me feel around your sinuses… … There's some tenderness here, on both sides, especially when I press here . Now, let’s take a look at your nose. … I see some mild swelling in the nasal passages and a bit of mucus. Your throat looks normal. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing sinusitis, likely exacerbated by your work environment. The tenderness in your sinuses and the swelling in your nasal passages are consistent with that. The mucus could be a result of the inflammation. We don't have a fever or any other signs of a more serious infection, which is good. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Sinusitis… from the dust? It is… from my work? That makes… sense, I think. So… what does that mean? What do we do about it? Will it go away? It is… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I just want it to stop, Doctor. Is there… medicine?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s likely related to your work environment and the dust exposure. It's common for people who work outdoors to develop sinusitis, especially if they're not wearing proper protection. As for what we do, there are several options. Mild cases often resolve on their own with supportive care, but since this has been going on for a couple of months, we can try a few things to help speed up the process. First, we can try a nasal saline rinse to help clear out the mucus and reduce inflammation. You can find those at most pharmacies. Second, a decongestant can help relieve the pressure and congestion, but it shouldn't be used for more than a few days. Lastly, if the congestion is really bothering you, we can try a short course of a nasal steroid spray to reduce the inflammation. Would you be willing to try those things?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am willing to try. Saline rinse… and… decongestant? Nasal spray? Yes, whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. Is it… expensive? I don’t have much… money. And… how do I use them? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. The saline rinse and decongestant are relatively inexpensive – usually under $10 each. The nasal spray might be a bit more, around $15-20, but there are often generic options available, which are cheaper. I'll write you prescriptions for the decongestant and nasal spray. The decongestant is to be taken as directed on the label – usually twice a day for no more than three to five days. The nasal spray, you’ll want to use two sprays in each nostril once a day. It’s important to shake the bottle well before each use. For the saline rinse, you can find instructions on the bottle, or I can print out a handout for you. Essentially, you'll mix the saline powder with distilled or sterile water and then flush it through your nasal passages using a neti pot or a squeeze bottle. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I don't think so. I told you before, I have never had a bad reaction to medicine. But… how do I know if it is working? And… what if it doesn’t get better? What then? I worry about… losing my job. If I can’t work… we will be in trouble.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mikeisha. It’s good you're thinking ahead. You should start to feel some relief within a few days of starting the saline rinse and medications. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they get worse, please come back and see me. We can discuss other options, such as a referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist, or consider other possible causes. And I understand your concern about your job. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better so you can continue working. In the meantime, it's also really important to wear a mask at work to protect yourself from the dust. Do you have access to masks?
PATIENT: Masks… yes, I have a few. My husband bought them when… everything was bad, you know? But they are… uncomfortable. It is hard to breathe when I work. But… I will try. I will wear a mask. If I have to. So… saline rinse, medicine, mask… and come back if it doesn’t get better? Is that right? And… how much does it cost? The medicine? I don’t have much money, Doctor. I worry about… everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly right. Saline rinse, medicine, mask, and come back if it doesn’t improve. Let’s talk about the cost. The saline rinse is usually very affordable, around $5-10. The decongestant and nasal spray will likely be around $10-20 total, depending on the brand and where you purchase them. I can also write you a prescription for a generic version of the nasal spray to help lower the cost. I also want to let you know about some resources in the area that can help with medication costs. There's a program called [Name of local medication assistance program] that offers discounts on prescriptions for people with limited incomes. I can print out some information for you. And I want to assure you, we'll work together to find a solution that works for you. Your health is the most important thing. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Resources… for medicine? That is… very kind of you. I will take the information. And… thank you. For everything. You have been very… helpful. And patient. I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… try the medicine, wear a mask, and come back if it doesn’t get better? Is that right? I think I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. Very much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Try the medicine, wear a mask, and come back if it doesn't get better. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’m glad I could help, Mikeisha. I want you to feel better soon. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day. And be sure to follow up with us in a week or so, or sooner if your symptoms worsen.
PATIENT: .
