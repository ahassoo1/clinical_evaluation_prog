DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Look here, Doctor, I ain’t got all day. I got a… a thing I wanna get done. A cosmetic thing. And I need you to say it’s alright. I understand you folks give clearances for… procedures. That's all. Don't need a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: A “thing,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a thing. Look, it’s… personal. But I need to know if my health… if it’ll allow for it. I don’t see what the problem is. I’m a reasonably healthy man, considering. Worked on towers my whole life. That should count for something, right? Don't need a full examination if it ain't necessary.
DOCTOR: “Reasonably healthy” is…subjective, Mr. Honcoop. And frankly, working on towers doesn’t preclude one from having underlying medical conditions. I require a thorough history to provide any sort of clearance, cosmetic or otherwise. It's a matter of professional responsibility, and frankly, it protects you. Now, let’s start with the basics. What specifically are you hoping to have done?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. It's… a little touch-up. A tummy tuck. That's all. Just want to get rid of some… excess. And I already told you, I don’t have time for a “thorough history.” I ain't got any problems. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Now, can we just get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: A tummy tuck. Very well. While I respect your time, Mr. Honcoop, a simple request for a cosmetic procedure does not exempt you from standard medical protocol. I need to understand your overall health to assess the risks. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions? No, sir. Not that I recall. Maybe a little… indigestion now and then. But that’s it. Look, I’m a simple man. Worked hard, ate right… mostly. I don’t go to doctors. They just tell you what you already know. I don't have time for ailments and diagnoses. Can you just check my blood pressure or something and tell me if I'm good to go?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, "a little indigestion" could be indicative of a multitude of things. And frankly, relying on self-assessment is… unwise. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No, not that I remember. Maybe when I was a boy? A tonsil thing, perhaps? A very long time ago. It was nothing serious. Look, I'm telling you, I’m a healthy man. I can climb a tower faster than a monkey. That takes… stamina. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Stamina is not a substitute for a medical history, Mr. Honcoop. Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, sir. I take whatever they give me. Never had a problem. Look, I’m a practical man. If something hurts, I ignore it. Now, are you going to clear me or not? I got a schedule to keep. This is getting ridiculous. I've wasted half the morning already.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, your…dismissive attitude is not conducive to a proper medical evaluation. I need to know what medications you currently take, if any. Even over-the-counter medications or supplements.
PATIENT: Supplements? Look here, I take a little… something for my joints. You know, aches and pains. Old age. Can't recall the name. Some kind of… herbal thing a friend gave me. And maybe some aspirin now and then for headaches. That’s it! I don't need a list of every little thing. Just tell me if I’m healthy enough for this tummy tuck, or not. This is beyond a joke. I’m a grown man, I know my body.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, an "herbal thing" could interact with anesthesia, or exacerbate underlying conditions. And aspirin thins the blood, which is crucial information before any surgical procedure. I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam. Blood pressure and pulse are insufficient. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and assess your overall health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I am not having you poke and prod me. I told you, I don’t have time for this. You’re wasting my time and my money. I’ll go somewhere else. Somewhere that respects a grown man's time. This is preposterous! Good day, Doctor. And don't bother sending a bill.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, refusing a basic medical evaluation is irresponsible! You are putting your health at risk. I strongly advise you to reconsider. .
