DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Georgiou, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently, and it’s…different. It's not worse, exactly, just different than what I usually smell like. I thought I should get it checked out, you know, just in case.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Kerriann. It’s always best to get these things checked out, and you’re right to be proactive. It's good you came in. “Different” is a helpful way to describe it. Can you tell me more about that difference?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think… Usually, I just smell…like me, if that makes sense? A little bit of soap, maybe. But lately, it's…sweeter, I guess? Not like perfume sweet, more like…a faintly fruity smell. It’s hard to explain. It’s mostly noticeable when I'm working, after I’ve been on my feet for a while. And it’s not all the time, just sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, “sweeter” and “faintly fruity” – that’s helpful. And it’s related to activity, you said, noticeable after being on your feet. Do you notice it in any other situations – like after certain foods, or at a specific time of day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… I haven’t really noticed it after eating anything specific. I eat pretty much the same things as always – lots of vegetables, some chicken, injera when I can get it. I haven’t noticed a specific time of day either, just when I'm working hard, getting a sweat on. It might be a little more noticeable in the evenings, but that could just be because I’m more aware of it after a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fairly consistent activity-related, not obviously linked to diet or time of day. Now, just to get a bit of a broader picture, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… Hmm. Well, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual lately, but honestly, who isn’t? I’m 49, I lay floors all day, that's gotta be it. No fever, no weight loss, nothing like that. My appetite is normal. I did have a cold a few weeks ago, but that's gone now. Oh! And my periods have been a little irregular, stopping and starting, but that’s probably just…you know, getting older. I haven't really thought much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, recent cold, and some irregular periods. That’s good information to have. Just to clarify on the periods – how irregular are we talking?
PATIENT: Well, usually they come pretty regularly, like clockwork. But the last couple of months, they've been…off. One month they were a few days early, the next they were late, and then they came lighter than usual. It’s not heavy bleeding, just…less. And shorter. Like, normally they're four or five days, now they're more like two or three. It’s not a huge deal, I just thought it was…normal. But now that you ask, maybe it's not.
DOCTOR: Okay, shorter duration and lighter flow, coupled with the irregularity. That’s definitely worth noting. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been under control with medication for a while now. I take lisinopril, 20mg every day. Aside from that, I’m pretty healthy. I don’t have any allergies, and I haven’t had any major surgeries. My mom had diabetes, but I haven’t been diagnosed with it myself. I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago, that’s probably important. And I get Medicare.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension with lisinopril 20mg daily, a history of hysterectomy ten years ago, and a family history of diabetes. Thank you for letting me know. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a look at your general appearance. Then I’ll want to do a more focused exam, if you don’t mind. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to get to the bottom of this smell. It's just… unnerving, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's always best to investigate something that's concerning you. Alright, let's start. Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so, and we know you’re on medication for hypertension. Now, I'd like to examine your skin. Sometimes changes in body odor can be related to skin conditions. And I'll also do a quick neurological exam just to be thorough. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Check away. I appreciate you being so thorough. I just… I want to make sure it’s not anything worrying. I really don't want to have to worry about some rare disease or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, your skin looks good, and your reflexes and coordination are normal. Everything looks physically okay so far. Given your history of a hysterectomy and the changes in your periods, and the unusual odor, I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any hormonal imbalances and check your overall health. I also think a urine sample would be a good idea, just to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood work and a urine sample, okay. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. Will the blood work tell us anything about… hormones? That makes sense, given everything. And it's good to check for infection too, I guess. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should avoid until we get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood work will include a panel to check your hormone levels, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and FSH. It's good you brought up the hormone levels, it's a very reasonable consideration with the changes in your periods and hysterectomy history. And checking a urine sample will rule out any potential infections that could be causing the change in odor. For now, there's nothing specific you need to avoid. Just continue with your regular routine. I would recommend avoiding any strong perfumes or scented lotions for the next few days, just to make sure it doesn’t interfere with our assessment. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. No perfumes or scented lotions, got it. I can definitely do that. A few days to wait for the results…okay. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Georgiou. It makes me feel a lot better knowing what we’re looking for. I'll go to the lab tomorrow and get everything done. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And I'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Have a good rest of your day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Georgiou. You too! I will.
