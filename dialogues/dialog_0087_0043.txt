DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right in the back of my head. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and it just doesn't seem to be going away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. A headache, you say. And you mentioned it's been going on for "a little while." Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? At first, it was just kinda dull, like a pressure. I thought it was just from working too long at the computer, you know? I do a lot of financial planning for folks, so I’m on it a good part of the day. But it hasn't gotten better, and sometimes it feels… sharp. Not all the time, just sometimes. It’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A dull pressure that sometimes sharpens – I understand. And it’s been about three weeks now. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It's not always there, thankfully. But it’s been happening more and more often. Like, a few days ago I was helping Mrs. Henderson sort out her retirement, and it really flared up while I was explaining everything. Had to stop for a bit. It’s worse when I’m really concentrating, I think. And sometimes, I notice it feels a little stiff in my neck too, when it's bad. Not always, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes and goes, is worse with concentration, and you’ve noticed some neck stiffness at times. Have you noticed anything else associated with the headaches?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I'm 84, Doctor! I figure some tiredness just comes with the territory, you know? Nothing major. And I haven’t had any trouble with my vision, or anything like that. No nausea, no dizziness. Just…the headache and sometimes the neck feels a bit achy. Oh, and I've been sleeping okay, if that matters. Pretty regular sleep schedule.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the sleep. And you haven't noticed any changes in your vision, no nausea or dizziness – that’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask some general questions, just to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, years ago, when my wife was still with us, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. But that was a long time ago, and he put me on a little pill for it. I took it for a while, and he said it was okay to stop after a few years, so I did. Haven't had any problems with it since. No diabetes, no heart problems, not as far as I know. I used to be pretty active, always out in the garden, but I don't get around as much these days. Mostly just workin' at the computer, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but it resolved with medication and hasn’t been a concern since. And you haven’t been diagnosed with anything else. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, yes. Years and years ago, I had my appendix taken out. When I was a young man, serving in the Army. And… well, when I broke my wrist falling off a ladder while pruning a pear tree. They set it, and it healed up fine. But that was a long time ago. No other surgeries that I can recall. Nothing recent, anyway.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and a wrist fracture in the past. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother, she passed away when she was quite old, but she had some trouble with her heart towards the end. And my older brother, he had a stroke, I think. But that was before I knew him very well – we didn't see each other much. My wife’s family… they mostly lived a long time, but I don't really know what ailments they had. We didn't talk about things like that much, back in those days. Does that help? It's hard to recall everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. History of heart trouble in your mother and a stroke in your brother. Thank you. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she used to smoke a little, but she quit years ago. I always told her it was bad for her health. And I drink… well, I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. Nothing heavy. Mostly just water, to be honest. I try to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Good. No smoking and minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Like I said, I used to take a little pill for my blood pressure, but that was years ago. Now, I just try to take care of myself, eat right, and get enough sleep. Mostly just vitamins, if that counts. A little Vitamin D, especially in the winter months. Living in this climate, you don’t get much sun, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell, thank you for answering all of my questions. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/86. Not dramatically, but something we'll keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Coordination is good. I'm also going to gently palpate your neck muscles to see if I can identify any tenderness. There's some mild tenderness in the muscles on the back of your neck, which likely corresponds to what you've been describing. Overall, the physical exam is relatively normal, but the elevated blood pressure and neck tenderness are things we’ll need to address.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I figured my blood pressure might be a little high, I haven’t had it checked in a while. And yes, my neck does get stiff sometimes, especially when I'm concentrating. So, what do you think it is? Is it serious? I'm not worried, but I just like to know what's going on, you know?
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, my initial thought is this is likely a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by stress and prolonged computer use, and possibly related to mild hypertension. The neck tenderness supports the tension headache diagnosis. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health and kidney function. And I’d also like to get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on and ensure there are no underlying issues. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before ordering these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. That sounds sensible, getting some tests done. Better to be safe than sorry, right? I trust your judgment. So, what happens next? Do I need to come back for another appointment? And… will these tests be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the allergies. And yes, better to be safe. I'll write you an order for the blood work and EKG. You can get these done at the clinic lab – we have a payment assistance program for patients with limited income, so please speak to the receptionist when you schedule your appointment, and they can provide you with information. The cost will depend on the specific tests, but we’ll do our best to minimize it. I’d like to see you back in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend trying some over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the headache, and making sure to take frequent breaks from the computer. Gentle stretching of your neck and shoulders might also help. And, perhaps most importantly, ensure you’re getting enough rest and minimizing stress. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very manageable. I can definitely do that. I’ll schedule the tests with the receptionist right away, and I’ll ask about the payment assistance program. I appreciate you thinking of that. And I'll try the pain relievers and the stretching. It's just sometimes hard to step away from work, you know? People rely on me. But I'll make an effort. One week, then. Thank you, Doctor Soodeen. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I understand completely about people relying on you. But remember, taking care of yourself is important too. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Here’s the order for your tests. And if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe headache, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness—please contact the clinic immediately, don’t wait for your appointment. I'll see you next week. Please let the receptionist know if you have any questions when scheduling. Have a good day, Percell.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too.
