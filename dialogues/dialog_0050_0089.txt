DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh dear… what does bring me in… It's… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. A lot of pain, down low. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, it’s quite unpleasant. I believe my regular doctor mentioned something about… a condition I have? Systemic Lupus… or something like that? It’s all a bit hazy, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Systemic Lupus, yes. I see here in your chart a confirmed diagnosis from Dr. Chen, approximately five years ago. And you're experiencing abdominal pain now?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Dr. Chen… a very good woman. I remember her being very kind. And yes, the pain… it’s been… well, it’s been happening on and off for… oh, goodness, I can't quite put a timeframe on it. Weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to say. Sometimes it's just a dull ache, other times it feels like… like a twisting. It doesn’t seem to have a pattern, not one I can discern, anyway.
DOCTOR: "Intermittent abdominal pain, duration approximately weeks, variable quality." Very well. And does anything seem to trigger this pain, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? That’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific, no. I eat pretty much the same things, do the same activities… I try to keep a regular schedule, you see. Perhaps… stress? Although, I haven’t been particularly stressed lately. Oh! Sometimes after I… exercise, a little bit of a sharper pain. But I don’t overdo it, mind you. Just a gentle walk, usually. It's all so perplexing!
DOCTOR: Exercise-induced pain… interesting. And you mentioned Lupus. Have you noticed any other symptoms coinciding with this abdominal discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Other symptoms… Let me think. Well, I do get rather tired, more so than usual. And my joints… they ache sometimes, but that’s been happening for years, honestly. It’s hard to say what's new and what’s just… the usual. I've had a little bit of a rash, on my cheeks, I think? It comes and goes, very faint, though. Is that connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: A facial rash, fatigue, and joint pain… These can be associated with Lupus flares, Ms. Glymph. However, abdominal pain is not typically a primary symptom, which is why we need to investigate further. Now, let’s delve a little deeper into the nature of this pain. When you say “twisting,” can you describe that sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Precisely… that's a difficult one. It's not a cramping pain, not exactly. More like… a pulling, a tightening. And it feels… deep inside. Not just on the surface, if that makes any sense. And sometimes it radiates… goes up into my back, a little bit. It's hard to explain… I’m not very good at describing these things, I apologize. It just… feels uncomfortable. Profoundly uncomfortable. And it makes me feel quite… weak.
DOCTOR: “Deep, pulling abdominal pain with radiation to the back, associated with weakness.” I understand it can be difficult to articulate these sensations. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel habits. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well, yes, actually. I’ve been… a little irregular, lately. Some constipation, some… other things, if you understand me. It's not severe, but it is different than usual. It’s all rather unsettling, truthfully. Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, changes in bowel habits are certainly pertinent information. And given your history of Lupus, it’s important to rule out any related complications. Now, Ms. Glymph, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination of your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need you to point to me exactly where you are experiencing the most discomfort. I’ll also be listening with my stethoscope and gently palpating your abdomen. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. I apologize, my balance isn’t what it used to be. A little help, perhaps? And yes, pointing to the area… that shouldn’t be a problem. It’s right… about here. That's where it's the worst.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. Let’s get you comfortable. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please breathe normally. Bowel sounds are… present, but somewhat diminished. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that’s… no, not particularly. Just… normal, I suppose. Ooh! Yes, that’s… a little tender there. A bit uncomfortable, yes. But nothing… unbearable. Just… noticeable. Perhaps it’s just me being sensitive. I do worry easily, you see.
DOCTOR: "Tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, no guarding or rebound tenderness noted." Now, Ms. Glymph, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and a stool sample for occult blood. These tests will give us a better understanding of what's going on and help rule out any other potential causes of your abdominal pain. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Those all sound… sensible. A complete blood count, you said? I suppose that will show if something is amiss. And a stool sample… Well, it’s not the most pleasant thing, but if it helps, then certainly. Yes, please. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your expertise completely.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will come by shortly to collect the samples. In the meantime, I’m going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. This will allow us to visualize your internal organs and identify any potential abnormalities. There is a small amount of radiation involved, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a CT scan? That sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? I haven't had one before. Contrast dye… I don't think I’m allergic to anything… but honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I used to be so organized, always keeping track of things. Now… I just can’t recall. No, I don’t believe I have any known allergies, but perhaps I should check with my sister? She remembers everything for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s always best to be certain. While we wait for your sister’s input, let’s proceed as though you do have no known allergies. The radiologist will administer the contrast dye intravenously prior to the scan. It may cause a warm sensation, and you may feel a metallic taste in your mouth. It’s also important to remain still during the scan. Now, Ms. Glymph, while we await the lab results and the CT scan, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help alleviate your abdominal discomfort. I'm going to start with dicyclomine, 20mg, three times a day. It's an antispasmodic that can help reduce cramping and spasms. Are you currently taking any other medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… helpful. A warm sensation, you say? And a metallic taste? Well, I suppose I can tolerate that, if it means some relief. And dicyclomine… that sounds… like a complicated name. Medications… let me think. I take a low-dose aspirin, every morning, for my heart. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little bit of melatonin. Just a small dose, mind you. Nothing else, I believe. Unless… oh, my sister gave me something for my arthritis a few months ago, but I haven’t taken it in a while. I don’t even remember what it was called.
DOCTOR: "Aspirin daily, melatonin prn. Obtain medication list from sister." Very well. It’s crucial we have a comprehensive list to avoid any potential drug interactions. Now, Ms. Glymph, given your Lupus diagnosis and the unexplained abdominal pain, I recommend a follow-up appointment with a rheumatologist. They are specialists in autoimmune diseases and can provide more specialized care. Would you like me to provide a referral?
PATIENT: Oh, a rheumatologist… yes, that sounds… sensible. A specialist, you say? Dr. Chen, my previous doctor, mentioned something about needing to see someone regularly, but I haven’t gotten around to it. Yes, please, a referral would be wonderful. That would take a great deal of burden off my shoulders. I do worry about remembering everything, you see. So many appointments, so many medications… it’s all rather overwhelming. And I trust your judgment entirely, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m printing the referral now. Now, let’s summarize. We’ve ordered blood work, a stool sample, and a CT scan. You’re prescribed dicyclomine for symptom relief, and I’m providing a referral to a rheumatologist. I want you to call my office immediately if you experience any severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That’s… a lot. Blood work, stool sample, CT scan, medication, referral… I’m not sure I can keep track of everything. But I will try, I promise. No, I don’t think I have any questions at this moment. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for taking such good care of me. I appreciate your patience, and your… thoroughness. I feel a little bit better, just knowing that we’re taking steps to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Glymph. I’ll have the nurse come by shortly to review the instructions and answer any remaining questions. Remember, don’t hesitate to contact my office if anything concerns you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Good day. .
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thank you again, Doctor. And good day to you as well. I appreciate your help. Now… where did I put my purse…?
