DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated for me to explain. My daughter, she wants… a baby. And she thinks I should come with her, to… make sure everything is okay first. I’m not sure I understand exactly why I’m here, but she was very insistent. It’s about… before the baby, right? Before it happens? I’m Smith, by the way.
DOCTOR: Right. So, your daughter is seeking pregnancy, and she’s brought you in for… a consultation related to that process?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. A process. She said something about… making sure I’m healthy enough. I’m… not a young man anymore. And she worries, you see. She’s a good girl, my daughter. Always looking after everyone. I don't know much about what I need to do, though. Is it… tests? Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: It sounds like she’s being proactive, which is good. Yes, it will involve some questions, and likely a physical exam and some bloodwork, Mr. Verrall. It's to assess your overall health and identify any potential risks that could affect a pregnancy. It shouldn't be painful, no. Mostly just routine checks. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor before this?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I’ve been… okay, mostly. A few aches and pains, you know, getting old. I worked as a Sales Engineer for many years, lots of travel. Didn’t have much time for doctors. I think I had a checkup… maybe ten years ago? But I can’t really remember what they did. I don't have a regular doctor I can tell you. I mostly just… tried to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, limited recent medical care. That's good to know. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe a bit of a sniffle sometimes with dust, but that’s it. When I was a boy, I got stung by a bee and my arm swelled up, but that was a long time ago. I don’t remember having any trouble with anything since then. It’s hard to recall, you know? So many years…
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant allergies reported. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a little something for my knee, sometimes. It gets sore after I walk too much. It's… I think it's called ibuprofen? The white tablets. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take something… a little pink one. But not every night. Just when I really need to. I get it at the shop, you know, not from a doctor. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is important, Mr. Verrall. Both the ibuprofen and the pink tablet. Do you know the dosage of the ibuprofen you’re taking?
PATIENT: Dosage…? Oh dear. I just… take two, usually. When it hurts. Sometimes one is enough. I don’t really pay attention to how many milligrams, I just grab a couple. The pink ones… even less idea. Small tablets. Maybe… five or six? I really don't know. I just take what seems right. Is that bad? I'm sorry, I'm not good with these things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verrall. We just need to get a clearer picture of what you’re taking. It’s important for assessing potential interactions and making sure everything is safe. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… hmm. The doctor, years ago, said my numbers were a little high, but he just told me to eat less salt. I don’t think it was a big deal. Diabetes… no, I don't think so. My father had something with his sugar, but I don’t know if it was diabetes. Heart problems… no, I haven't been told anything about my heart. I used to be very active, always walking and working. I feel pretty good, most of the time. A bit tired these days, but that’s just getting old, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, “a bit tired” and “a bit high” are not sufficient information. We need specifics. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with hypertension, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Formal… diagnosed? I don't know. He just… said things. I went to the doctor, and he took my pressure, and he told me to watch the salt. And he asked about my sugar, and said I should eat less sweets. He didn't give me any papers, or anything. Just… advice. I don’t remember the exact words. It was a long time ago, and I didn’t think it was important enough to write down. Is it important now? Should I have remembered all of this? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand it can be difficult to recall details from the past. However, for your daughter's sake, and to ensure the safety of a potential pregnancy, we need to be as thorough as possible. It's crucial to know if you have any underlying medical conditions. Given your limited recall, and the potential for undiagnosed issues, I recommend a full blood panel, a urinalysis, an EKG to assess your heart function, and a blood pressure check. We'll also need to review your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like… a lot. Blood panel… EKG… I'm not sure I can remember all that. But… for my daughter… yes, okay. If that’s what’s needed. Family history… hmm. My father… he had trouble with his sugar, like I said. And his heart… I think he had some problems with his heart when he was old. My mother… she was always very healthy, I think. Never sick. My sister… she had some trouble with her blood pressure, I remember now, she took pills for it. But that was years ago… I'm sorry, I’m trying my best to remember. It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. So, family history of diabetes, hypertension, and potential heart disease. We'll proceed with the blood work, urinalysis, and EKG. And finally, before we move forward with the physical exam, can you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… Oh! When I was young, I broke my arm, playing football. They had to put it in a cast. That’s… was that a surgery? And… later, when I was working, I had some trouble with my back. I went to the hospital, and they gave me some injections. It wasn’t a big operation, just… needles. I think that’s all. Nothing major. Just a broken arm and some back injections.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a childhood arm fracture and back injections. We'll document that. Now, Mr. Verrall, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too much, my back gets sore easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. We'll need to monitor that closely. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. I’m noting some mild tenderness in your lower back upon palpation. Can you describe the nature of that discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, that's where it hurts sometimes. It's... a dull ache, mostly. Gets worse if I bend over, or lift something heavy. It's not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes. I usually just try to ignore it, and take it easy. I've had it for years, really. It doesn't bother me too much, most of the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, chronic lower back pain, described as a dull ache exacerbated by bending and lifting. We will need to discuss potential management strategies for that pain. Now, I'm going to order the blood work, urinalysis and EKG. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. After the tests are completed, we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s a lot to take in. I hope everything is okay. For my daughter… I want to make sure she's safe, and the baby is safe. That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Verrall. We'll do everything we can to ensure both your health, and the potential health of your daughter’s future child. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don't hesitate to ask if any questions arise. .
PATIENT: .
