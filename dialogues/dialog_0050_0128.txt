DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I am Dr. Bradelee Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning Doctor… Paraskevopoulos, is it? Yes, that’s right. Um… well, my joints. They’re just… stiff, mostly in the mornings. It’s been going on… a while now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly how long. Everything feels a little foggy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Foggy” can be a very descriptive term. Stiffness in the mornings… and you say this has been ongoing for some time. Could you quantify that “some time” for me, if possible?
PATIENT: Oh dear… quantify. That means… how long exactly, right? Hmm… Let me think. It’s definitely since… well, since my husband passed. That was… oh, goodness. Three years? Maybe four? It’s all a bit of a blur, truly. I just remember waking up and things feeling… creaky. And it doesn’t really go away completely, just… less bad as the day goes on.
DOCTOR: Three or four years… I see. And is this stiffness localized to certain joints, or is it more generalized?
PATIENT: Generalized, I think is the word? It’s not just one spot. My hands, mostly. And my knees… definitely my knees. And sometimes my… shoulders? It’s hard to pinpoint. It's just… everything feels a bit rusty in the morning, you know? Like an old gate that needs oiling. I don’t think it’s painful painful, just… not easy to move.
DOCTOR: “Rusty” is a good analogy, Ms. Voner. It helps me to understand. And you've indicated it's not sharply painful, more a difficulty with movement. Do you experience any swelling or redness in any of these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't noticed any redness, no. My hands… they sometimes feel a little… thick? But I just figured that was because of the cold. It gets chilly in the mornings, even in August, you know? I haven't really paid much attention, honestly. It’s just been… easier to ignore it, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: I see. While dismissing discomfort can be a coping mechanism, it’s important to investigate these things. Now, aside from the joint stiffness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I do get tired, very tired sometimes. But who doesn’t, at my age? And… I don’t sleep as well as I used to, that's for sure. Just… restless legs, mostly. But I don’t know if that’s related to my joints or just… old age again. Everything hurts a little bit when you get older, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It is true that certain ailments become more prevalent with age, Ms. Voner, however, it’s important to ascertain if these symptoms are interconnected. You mentioned fatigue and restless legs… Have you experienced any fever, weight loss, or any changes in your vision or skin?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. And I don't think I've lost weight… maybe a little, but that's probably just because my appetite hasn’t been great lately. Everything just tastes… bland, you know? And my vision… hmm. I’ve been needing my glasses adjusted again, but I just haven't gotten around to it. It's always something, isn't it? And changes in my skin… no, not that I've noticed. They're just… old skin, I suppose. Wrinkly and a little spotty.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move onto your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or any other autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh dear… chronic conditions. That sounds… serious. Let me think. I had… something with my gallbladder, years ago. They took it out. And I had the flu, of course, many times. But… rheumatoid arthritis, lupus… no, I don't think so. The doctors never told me anything like that. I mostly just see a… a general practitioner, you know? He’s retired now, though. A lovely man.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. That was a long time ago, though. And… I think I had a cyst removed from my wrist once. But it was a very small thing, barely even a scar. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your family history… are there any family members – parents, siblings, or children – who have been diagnosed with autoimmune disorders, arthritis, or any chronic joint pain?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. That’s a good question… My mother… she had bad arthritis in her hands, yes. Very bad. She couldn’t knit anymore, it was so painful. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, she had something with her bones, I think. They said it was… osteoporosis? But I don't really understand all those medical terms. Everything just sounds so complicated, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. And finally, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Smoke? No, never. My husband smoked, but I always told him it was terrible for him. And drink… just a little wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass, just to relax. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I'm not a big drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Voner, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to assess your joints and overall condition. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m used to poking and prodding, you know? I used to help my mother with her creams and things when her joints were bad. So go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I’ll begin with an assessment of your hands. There is mild tenderness to palpation in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. Range of motion is slightly limited, with crepitus noted. No visible swelling or erythema. Knees exhibit similar findings to the hands - mild tenderness, limited range of motion, and crepitus. No effusion noted. Based on this preliminary examination, Ms. Voner, your symptoms and findings suggest possible osteoarthritis. However, to rule out other potential causes, I recommend some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and rheumatoid factor. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… osteoarthritis? That sounds… serious. Tests… laboratory tests? What exactly are those tests for? I don’t like needles, you know. And I don’t have insurance, so… will they be very expensive? Honestly, it all sounds a bit overwhelming. What happens if it is osteoarthritis? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, let me assure you, the laboratory tests are relatively straightforward. They are simply blood draws to help us determine the cause of your joint pain. They will provide us with more information and allow us to formulate an accurate diagnosis. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. We can discuss payment options with the billing department. Regarding surgery, that is not necessarily the outcome. Osteoarthritis is often managed with conservative treatments, such as physical therapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications. Surgery is typically reserved for severe cases that do not respond to these measures. However, before we jump to conclusions, we need to obtain the laboratory results. Would you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Well… if it’s just blood work, I suppose so. But please, be quick. And not too deep, alright? And… you said there’s other options besides surgery? Physical therapy… that sounds… tiring. But better than a knife, I suppose. Yes, alright. I’ll consent to the tests. Just… let me know what I need to do, and try not to poke too much, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. The laboratory requisition will be sent to the phlebotomy department. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. I will also provide you with a handout outlining exercises to help maintain joint flexibility. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. A handout… that’s helpful. Hmmm… Ibuprofen… I think I have some of that at home. Let me see… yes, actually, I do have a question. You said… exercise, right? But my knees… they sometimes feel like they’re going to buckle, just walking around. Will the exercise make that worse? And… is it alright to still do a little gardening? I really enjoy my roses, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Voner, it is essential to approach exercise cautiously, especially given your concern about knee instability. Start slowly, with gentle range-of-motion exercises. Avoid any movements that cause sharp pain. As for gardening… that is permissible, but modify your activities to minimize stress on your knees. Avoid prolonged kneeling or heavy lifting. Perhaps utilize a garden stool or assistive tools. However, if your symptoms worsen, immediately discontinue the activity and contact me. It is crucial to listen to your body and avoid exacerbating the condition. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Slow and gentle… avoid pain… listen to my body. Garden stool… I think I have one of those in the shed. It all sounds a bit… complicated. But I’ll try. I promise. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to review your laboratory results and assess your progress. In the meantime, should you experience any concerning symptoms – such as fever, severe pain, or sudden swelling – please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. And… please, don’t hesitate if you need anything. I'll be careful. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Voner. .
