DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me San. I need to get one of those cards… the one for driving people around, for work. A ride-share card, I think they call it. I operate logging equipment normally, but things have been slow, and I’m trying to pick up some extra money driving. It’s a bit of a hassle, all the paperwork, but I need to get it done. I hope this doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, a commercial driver's license endorsement for ride-sharing. I understand. It can be a bit involved, yes. We'll need to ensure you meet the medical requirements. Now, San, to begin, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… well, I’m seventy, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. But I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I try to stay active, even with the logging work being physically demanding. I had my gallbladder out… oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now? And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s manageable. Otherwise… I don’t really get sick much. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, San. Twenty years ago for the gallbladder removal… that’s helpful. And arthritis in the knees. Do you take anything for the arthritis, or manage it with other methods?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter stuff, mostly. Ibuprofen when it flares up, and I try to stretch regularly. Nothing prescribed, nothing fancy. It’s not bad enough for anything stronger, thankfully. I find keeping busy helps too – sitting still is what really makes it ache. You know, old lady problems.
DOCTOR: It's not just "old lady problems," San. Joint pain is common at any age. Now, let's talk about medications. Besides the ibuprofen as needed, are you currently taking any other prescriptions, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the ibuprofen when I need it. I used to take something for my blood pressure, maybe ten years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said I was doing fine without it. I haven't really needed anything since then. I eat pretty well, I think. Lots of fish, vegetables… my daughter always tells me I'm too healthy for my own good.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications currently. That's good to know. And fish and vegetables are excellent. Now, San, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me that question too – she worries a lot. I’ve eaten shellfish my whole life, no problems. Bees, pollen… nothing bothers me. Honestly, I think I’m the least allergic person she knows.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring, San. Now, let's briefly touch on your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father had heart problems later in life, needed a pacemaker. And my mother… she had some trouble with her memory as she got older, I think it was dementia, but it was a long time ago, and we didn’t really understand things as well then. My brother is fine, as far as I know, just the usual aches and pains of getting old. Is that what you needed? I'm not very good at remembering family medical stuff, honestly. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. That’s a helpful overview. Heart problems in your father and some memory issues in your mother. Now, just to be thorough, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried, and I put a stop to that very quickly. And I don’t drink, not really. Maybe a glass of wine with Christmas dinner, but that’s it. And definitely no… recreational drugs. I’m a very sensible woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I can certainly see that, San. Excellent. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. I really just want to get this card so I can start driving. Things have been slow with the logging, and my daughter keeps telling me I need to be careful with my money. So, the quicker we can get this done, the better! I appreciate you being so thorough, though.
DOCTOR: Very well, San. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and vision, and do a basic neurological assessment, just to ensure everything is in order. It shouldn't take long. Would you mind stepping up on the scale for me first?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Anything to get this done. Oh dear, I really should watch my weight. My daughter would have a field day with this number…
DOCTOR: 139 pounds. That’s alright, San. We all fluctuate. Now, if you could just have a seat on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first.
PATIENT: Okay. Here I am. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I always feel a bit silly sitting here in just my… well, never mind. Let’s get this over with!
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age and recent activity. Now, I'm just going to check your vision quickly. Can you read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me adjust my glasses… Okay, um… E, F, P, T… is that right? I think so. My vision isn’t what it used to be, you know. I need a stronger prescription, I think. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Vision is somewhat diminished, as you noted. We can certainly document that and recommend an updated prescription if you haven’t already. Now, just a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions and have you perform a few basic movements. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s… 2025, isn’t it? Yes, 2025. August 2nd, I believe. I try to keep track of the date, it's important. My daughter says I'm getting better at remembering things, but I still have my moments. Is that right? I hope I didn’t mess that up!
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfect, San. You are doing wonderfully. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? I have a bit of trouble with my neck, so it's a little stiff. Do I need to do anything else? I just want to get this over with quickly.
DOCTOR: Good, tracking is smooth. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that tight enough? I used to have very strong hands from working with the equipment, but they're not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Good, grip strength is adequate. Alright, San, everything appears to be within normal limits for your age and activity level. We'll document the slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished vision, and I recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician to discuss those further. Now, regarding the commercial driver’s license, do you have any history of seizures, loss of consciousness, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never had a seizure in my life, and I’ve never lost consciousness. I’m very careful, you see. I’ve always been a healthy person, despite my age. And I certainly wouldn't drive if I wasn't able to. So, no, no history of any of that. Are we getting closer to finishing now?
DOCTOR: Yes, San, we are. Based on this brief exam and your history, I don’t see any immediate contraindications to obtaining the commercial driver’s license. However, I recommend that you schedule a comprehensive eye exam with an optometrist, and follow up with your primary care physician regarding your blood pressure. I’ll also complete a medical examination report form – the DOT physical form – and we'll go over it together before submitting it. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news! Thank goodness. No, I don't think so. Just… how long will this form take to process? And will I be able to start driving right away? My daughter is already looking at cars, she’s very excited. I really appreciate you being so thorough and quick, Doctor. It’s a relief to know everything is okay.
DOCTOR: The processing time can vary depending on the state, but typically it takes between 2-4 weeks. Once the form is approved, you should be able to start driving immediately, provided you meet all other licensing requirements. I'll provide you with a copy of the completed form and instructions on how to submit it. Here's the completed DOT physical form. I've also highlighted the areas where the eye exam and blood pressure follow-up are recommended. Do you have any concerns about obtaining the eye exam or following up with your primary care physician?
PATIENT: No, no concerns at all. I’ll schedule the eye exam right away, and I have a good relationship with my doctor, so that won’t be a problem. I just want to get this done and start earning some extra money. Thank you so much, Doctor Pirl. You’ve been a lifesaver. I think that’s everything. I’m so grateful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Here's my card with the clinic’s contact information. Drive safely, and I wish you all the best with your new endeavor!
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you Doctor. I'm sure I'll be just fine. Thank you again for everything. .
