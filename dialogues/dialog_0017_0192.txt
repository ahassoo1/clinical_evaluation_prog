DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I'm here for this... exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first. Seems silly, but you gotta do what you gotta do, right? Don't see why I need a doctor for this though. I feel fine. Always have.
DOCTOR: “Military physicals have requirements, Mr. Hartness, whether we understand them or not. It's standard procedure. Fine is subjective, however. Let’s begin with a proper history. To clarify, are you attempting to enlist or is this a routine check for continued service?
PATIENT: Enlist. I'm fifty-one, for crying out loud. Not continued service. Though I was good in the reserves, back in the day. But yeah, trying to get in. Seems like a good thing to do, get some discipline back in things. And frankly, the benefits aren't bad either. Don't see what the big deal is with all the questions, though. I told you, I feel fine. Strong as an ox.
DOCTOR: “Yes, well, age does present…certain considerations. And while your self-assessment is noted, Mr. Hartness, the military has specific health standards that must be met. It is not a matter of belief, but of documentation. Now, let’s start with the basics. Any significant past medical problems?
PATIENT: Significant? Hmm. Let me think. When I was a kid, I had the measles. Bad case, nearly didn't make it, my mother said. But that was ages ago. And I broke my arm, climbing a tree. Stupid thing to do, really. Other than that… not much. A few colds, the usual. Nothing that kept me down for long. I heal fast, see? Always have.
DOCTOR: “Measles, broken arm… documented. Any surgeries, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had any surgeries. Not a fan of knives. Always figured if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And if it is broke, I fix it myself. Always been handy with tools.
DOCTOR: “Very resourceful, I’m sure. Now, family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother, yeah, she's still around. Ninety-two, stubborn as a mule. Dad… passed away when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. Worked too hard, never took a day off. Not much of a family history to speak of, really. Just them, mostly. And a few cousins I haven't seen in years.
DOCTOR: “Heart trouble in the father… noted. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Makes you cough. Drink? A beer now and then, with the wife on a Saturday. Nothing crazy. Recreational drugs? What kind of question is that? I’m trying to join the military, not… well, you know.
DOCTOR: “Standard questions, Mr. Hartness. We need a complete picture. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I get a bit itchy when I'm around cats. My wife has one, a fluffy thing. Drives me mad. But it's just a bit of a sniffle, nothing serious. And I think I got a rash once from some cheap aftershave, but that was years ago. Nothing I'd go to the doctor for.
DOCTOR: “Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that's about it. Don't believe in all those pills. Your body's meant to handle things itself, if you treat it right. I eat good, get enough sleep, work hard. That’s all you need.
DOCTOR: “Very well. Now, Mr. Hartness, to proceed, I must perform a physical examination. It is standard procedure. Please step onto the scale.”
PATIENT: A physical? Fine. Just get it over with. Seems a bit much, but I guess I gotta do it. Just tell me if I'm still in good enough shape, alright? Don't need a lot of fancy talk.
DOCTOR: “Your weight is… 53 kilograms, Mr. Hartness. And your height is recorded as 1.87 meters. That gives you a Body Mass Index of… 15.2. Which is… significantly underweight. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs.” “Breathe deeply.”
PATIENT: Underweight? What are you talking about? I'm solid muscle! I work hard, remember? That's not fat, that's… lean mass. Probably just the scale. Hear that? Strong lungs!
DOCTOR: “Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and your lung sounds are… diminished. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.” “Please relax your arms.”
PATIENT: Hey! What was that for? That tickles! And what do you mean diminished? I can run circles around most fellas my age. This is ridiculous. What’s the point of all this anyway? You're telling me a little tap tells you something about my health?
DOCTOR: “Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, these are standard assessments. Your reflexes are…hypoactive. Your overall physical condition is… concerning, given your desire to enlist. I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a cardiology consult. I'll also need a urine sample.” “Before we proceed further, do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you may have neglected to mention?
PATIENT: Neglected to mention? Look, I told you, I feel fine! I don’t have any pre-existing conditions! This is a waste of my time! And frankly, it's starting to feel like you're trying to find something wrong with me just to get me out of this. Complete blood… whatchamacallit? Cardiology? This is insane. . I'm not doing any more of this. This is a joke.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional obligation to assess your health accurately. Given your age and the results of this initial assessment, proceeding with enlistment without further investigation would be… irresponsible. I strongly advise you to reconsider. I can provide you with referrals to specialists, but I will not sign off on any enlistment paperwork without a comprehensive medical evaluation.” "And frankly, I believe you should prioritize your health." .
