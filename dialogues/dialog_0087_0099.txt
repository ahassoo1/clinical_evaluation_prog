DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Soodeen. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results back from a test… a GI Endo Test, I believe it was called? And they weren’t quite right, so I thought I should come in and discuss them with someone. I’m a bit anxious about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Minatra. It’s always best to discuss these things directly. Let me pull up those GI endoscopy results now… Yes, here we are. Could you tell me what specifically the report said that concerned you, or what your understanding of the findings was?
PATIENT: Well, the woman who called from the lab… she said something about some inflammation, and a bit of… irregularity. She used a word I didn’t recognize, something about “polyps,” I think? And that it needed further investigation. I admit, I didn’t fully grasp everything she explained. I’m not a medical woman, you see. I mostly work with my hands, metal and plastic mostly. Is “polyps” a bad thing?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Medical terminology can be quite confusing. “Polyps” aren’t necessarily a bad thing in and of themselves, Ms. Minatra, but they do warrant investigation. They're abnormal growths in the lining of the colon. Some are harmless, but others can have the potential to become cancerous over time. That’s why we need to determine what kind they are. To get a clearer picture, could you describe any symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Well, for the past few months, I’ve had a bit of discomfort, a sort of cramping in my abdomen, mostly on the left side. It comes and goes. And… my bowel movements haven't been entirely regular. Sometimes a little constipated, sometimes… not. It’s been difficult to predict, honestly. I haven't noticed any blood, thankfully. Is that helpful information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Minatra. The cramping and changes in bowel habits are certainly relevant. No blood is good to hear. Could you describe the cramping a bit more?
PATIENT: It's… not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a dull ache, really. It usually starts in the lower left abdomen, and it can sometimes radiate around my side. It doesn’t come on suddenly; it builds up gradually, and it’s usually worse after I eat. Not always, but often. It doesn’t keep me up at night, or anything, but it's… persistent. And it makes me feel a little tired, if I’m honest. It’s been going on for, oh, I’d say about four months now, maybe a little longer. I just assumed it was my age, and things… slowing down.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Gradual onset, dull ache, related to eating… those are all important details. And it’s always good to rule things out, regardless of assumptions. Now, regarding your bowel movements, could you tell me a little more about the changes you've noticed?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as I mentioned, it’s unpredictable. Some days I’ll go several times, and the stool is… fairly normal, if you don't mind me being so blunt. Other days, it’s very difficult to go at all. The stool then is… harder, smaller. And occasionally, it feels like I haven't emptied everything completely. It’s a strange sensation. And sometimes, after I go, there’s a bit of urgency… a feeling like I need to go again very soon after. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. I apologize for the details.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Ms. Minatra. These details are exactly what I need to know to understand what’s going on. It's important. The urgency and the feeling of incomplete evacuation are also helpful information. Now, let's move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I tend to… avoid the scale. But I believe I have lost a few pounds. Not a dramatic amount, perhaps five or ten, over the past few months. I just attributed it to… less appetite, and being a bit preoccupied. I haven’t been eating as much as usual, but I haven’t been deliberately trying to lose weight. Does that make sense? I’m a small woman to begin with, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A few pounds of unintentional weight loss, combined with the other symptoms… okay. Now, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Well, I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. As an adult, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, I believe it was. And I had a bit of a problem with high blood pressure a few years back, but it was managed with medication for a while, and the doctor eventually took me off of it. He said my lifestyle changes had helped. I don’t see doctors often, if I can avoid it. I prefer to keep busy and let my body do its work. I also had a hysterectomy when I was 45, if that’s relevant. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very helpful. Gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, and past history of high blood pressure… I’m noting all of this. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to any medications, as far as I know. I've taken antibiotics a few times over the years, for minor infections, and pain relievers when needed, but never had any problems. I’m very careful about what I put into my body. I try to stay away from unnecessary things, if you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or other digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we don’t talk about health very much. It’s considered… private, you see. My mother passed away when I was young, from… a general weakness, I believe. She wasn’t one for doctors, either. My father, he lived to a good age, but he didn’t really share much about his health. I do remember my aunt, on my mother’s side, having some stomach problems when she was older, but I don’t know what exactly. She had a lot of discomfort, and she was often constipated, if I recall correctly. But I don’t know if it was anything serious, or if it’s relevant. It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family medical history can be difficult to gather. It’s helpful to know about your aunt’s stomach issues, even if the details are vague. Finally, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone now, my husband passed away five years ago. I keep busy with my work, metal and plastic work as I mentioned. I have a small workshop in my home. I enjoy creating things with my hands, it keeps my mind active. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, and lean protein. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I walk a little each day, when the weather permits, but I’m not very active otherwise. I don’t have any pets, and I don’t have many visitors. It’s a quiet life, but it suits me. I find comfort in routine, and in working with my hands.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Minatra. That gives me a good overall picture. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of your GI endoscopy, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. The endoscopy showed some inflammation and some polyps, as you mentioned. While many polyps are benign, we need to determine what type they are to rule out any potential for malignancy. I'm going to recommend a colonoscopy. It's a more detailed examination of the colon that allows us to take biopsies of any suspicious areas. It will also allow us to remove any polyps that are found. Would you be open to scheduling a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… That sounds… rather invasive, Doctor. What does it involve exactly? And is it very painful? I’ve heard stories… I'm not a fan of procedures, if I’m honest. And what if they find something… serious? I understand you’re recommending it, but I’d like to know a bit more before I make a decision.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Minatra. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a procedure like this. Let me explain the process in detail, and address your worries. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum and gently guiding it through your colon. We use a sedative to keep you comfortable and relaxed – most people don’t feel any pain at all during the procedure. You’ll be monitored closely throughout. The preparation involves cleaning out your colon beforehand, which is the least pleasant part, but it’s necessary for a clear view. Regarding finding something serious, it’s true that polyps can sometimes be cancerous or precancerous. But the good news is that if we find anything concerning, we can remove it during the procedure and send it to a lab for analysis. Early detection is key, and removing polyps can prevent cancer from developing. It’s important to remember that many people have polyps that are completely harmless. We’re just being proactive to ensure your health. Would you like me to explain the preparation process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The preparation… that sounds the most daunting part, to be honest. I’ve always been rather… sensitive to things like that. And how long would I be… incapacitated afterwards? I don’t have anyone to help me, you see. I manage things on my own. I suppose if it’s necessary, I can manage, but I need to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. The preparation is often the biggest concern for patients. It involves drinking a special solution that cleans out your colon – it causes diarrhea, so you’ll need to stay close to a bathroom. It’s not comfortable, but it’s only for a few hours the night before the procedure. We'll give you detailed instructions on how to prepare, and we can discuss strategies to make it more manageable. After the procedure, you’ll likely feel a bit groggy from the sedative, so you’ll need someone to drive you home. You may experience some mild cramping and bloating, but it usually subsides within a few hours. Most people are able to resume their normal activities the next day. Because you live alone, we will require you to have someone available to stay with you for the first 24 hours after the procedure, just for safety. It doesn’t need to be a full-time caregiver; someone who can check on you and make sure you’re recovering comfortably. Do you have a friend, family member, or neighbor who might be able to help?
PATIENT: That… that is a problem. I don’t really have anyone close by. My husband’s family… we’re not very close. And most of my friends have moved away or are… unwell themselves. I suppose I could ask Mrs. Henderson, my neighbor. She’s a kind woman, but she’s older, and I wouldn’t want to burden her. I really don’t like asking for help. Is there… is there any alternative? Perhaps a nurse could stay with me? I’m willing to pay, of course. I just… I’m very independent.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Minatra. It’s admirable that you’re so independent. It is a requirement for having someone available post-procedure, and it's for your safety. Let me explore some options for you. We do have a list of home healthcare agencies we can recommend, and some of them offer post-procedure care, including having a nurse stay with you for a few hours. It will likely involve a cost, but we can provide you with the contact information and you can inquire about their services and rates. Alternatively, some patients opt to spend the night at a recovery center after the procedure, where they can be monitored by medical staff. That might be a good option if you don't have someone available to stay with you at home. Let me get you information on both home healthcare agencies and recovery centers. And I’ll also talk to our scheduling coordinator to see if there’s any flexibility in terms of procedure times, to perhaps accommodate a neighbor’s availability. Would you like me to start with the information on home healthcare agencies and recovery centers?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful, Doctor. Knowing I have options makes me feel much better. The home healthcare agency sounds preferable, if possible. I’d like to remain in my own home, if I can. Thank you for being so understanding. I really appreciate it. Perhaps we can discuss the details of the preparation once I've had a chance to look into the post-procedure care options?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Minatra. That's perfectly fine. I'll have the nurse print out a list of local agencies for you, along with their contact information and websites. She'll also include information on what to expect during the procedure and the preparation process. Take your time reviewing the options, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. We’re here to support you every step of the way. For now, let's focus on getting you the information you need. I want you to feel comfortable and confident before making any decisions. Is there anything else I can address for you today, or are you all set for now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all for now. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience and understanding. Thank you again for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I'll review the information and call the office if I have any questions. Have a good day, Doctor Soodeen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. We want what’s best for you, and we’ll work together to ensure you receive the best possible care. Have a good day as well. And please, take care.
