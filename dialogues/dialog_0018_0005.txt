DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Stilaire. It is a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here… well, my niece, she thinks it’s time I considered a senior living facility. She says I need a proper check-up before making any decisions. Just to make sure I’m… fit for it, I suppose. It’s a bit much, if you ask me, but she worries. A good girl, my niece.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your niece, Mr. Tkac. It’s always good to have someone looking out for us. A comprehensive check-up is certainly a sensible approach before making any significant life changes. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what specifically is prompting her concern?
PATIENT: Well, she says I… misplace things. Keys, mostly. And sometimes I forget what I was saying mid-sentence. Small things, really. I always find the keys eventually, and I usually remember what I was talking about, give or take a few minutes. But she worries about me being alone, you see. Says if something did happen, no one would know. I live out a ways, on the reservation. Not a lot of neighbors close by. She’s a practical girl, always thinking ahead. It’s just… I’m perfectly capable, I assure you. I still bake every day. Best sourdough this side of the Missouri, if I do say so myself.
DOCTOR: That is excellent information, Mr. Tkac. Baking certainly requires quite a bit of cognitive function and coordination! It’s reassuring to hear you remain so active. Let's delve a little deeper into these instances of misplacing things and momentarily forgetting your train of thought. When did you first notice this starting to occur?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It crept up on me, I suppose. Maybe… six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It started with the keys, like I said. Then, a word here or there would slip my mind. Nothing major, just… frustrating. I’d be telling a story, and the name of the fellow I was talking about… gone. But it always comes back, eventually. I just… need a moment. It didn't bother me much at first. Old age, you know? Everyone forgets things. But my niece, she gets worried easily.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that it started gradually, and it’s very common for memory to shift as we age. Your niece’s concern is thoughtful, and it’s good we’re addressing it proactively. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a recent instance of forgetting something?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just yesterday, actually. Old Man Hemlock came by to trade for a loaf of rye. Fine fellow, Hemlock. We were talking about the fishing, how slow it’s been this year. And I knew his dog’s name. Beautiful blue heeler, that dog. Been with Hemlock for ten years. But the name… it was right on the tip of my tongue. I could see the dog, I could see Hemlock smiling… but the name just wouldn’t come. I stammered a bit, asked Hemlock to remind me. He chuckled, said it was “Blue.” Right there, plain as day. I felt like a fool, Doctor. A complete fool. It’s not the forgetting itself, it’s the feeling of it. Like something is missing.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Tkac. That is frustrating, and it sounds like the experience itself is causing you some distress, which is completely valid. It’s helpful to have such a specific example. Now, outside of these memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or behavior recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Not that I’ve noticed, not really. I still read the newspaper every day, though I do have to use my glasses more than I used to. And I still manage my finances, pay the bills, balance the books. Though my niece offers to help with that, she thinks I should let her take over. I won’t hear of it. I still enjoy a good game of checkers with Old Man Hemlock, and I usually win, if I'm honest. I suppose I get a bit… irritable sometimes. But that's just my nature. Always have been a bit of a grumpy old man, if I'm truthful. Not much has changed there. I haven’t gotten lost or confused, haven’t had trouble with my vision beyond needing glasses, and my hands are still steady enough to bake.
DOCTOR: That’s all very reassuring to hear, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like you’re maintaining a good level of independence and cognitive function in many areas. And it's good to know you haven't experienced any disorientation or changes in your vision beyond needing glasses. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. When I was a young man, serving in Korea, I took a bit of shrapnel to the leg. Didn’t bother me much, healed up fine. Doctor patched me right up. Other than that… high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a little pill for it every morning. Nothing serious. And arthritis in my hands, of course. It’s the baker’s curse, you know. All that kneading. But it’s manageable. I take some medicine for that too. No other major illnesses, not that I recall. I've always been a strong Lakota man. And I don't drink or smoke, never have. Oh, and my wife, bless her soul, she passed away ten years ago. Heart trouble. A good woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like you’ve led a full life, despite some challenges. And it’s good to hear you’ve maintained good health overall. You mentioned high blood pressure and arthritis. Could you tell me the names of the medications you take for those conditions, if you happen to know them?
PATIENT: Let me see… the doctor writes these things down, but my eyes aren't what they used to be. For the blood pressure… I think it’s Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril, that’s it. Little white pill. And for the arthritis… Naproxen, I believe. Pink one, that one. I take one of each every morning with my breakfast. My niece reminds me. She keeps a close eye on my pills, makes sure I don’t mix them up. A good girl, my niece. I haven’t changed any of my medications recently, not at all. Everything’s been the same for… oh, goodness, I don’t know, maybe five years now.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Tkac. Lisinopril and Naproxen, taken daily. And no recent changes to your medication regimen. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not ever. I eat just about everything, though I try to avoid too much sugar these days. My niece says it’s bad for my blood pressure. I’ve never had trouble with bee stings or poison ivy or anything like that. I’ve spent my whole life outdoors, hunting and fishing, and never had a problem. I suppose I’m a pretty durable Lakota man. I've never had a reaction to any medicine the doctor has given me either. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Tkac. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she lived to be a good age, eighty-nine, I think. She died peacefully in her sleep. She had arthritis, like me, but nothing else. My father… he was a hunter, a strong man. He died when I was young, a hunting accident. I don’t recall him having any major illnesses. And my sister… she had some trouble with her heart, passed away when she was in her fifties. But other than that… not a lot of major illnesses in my family, not that I recall. We Lakota are a strong people, you see. We live hard lives, but we’re durable. Most of my family lived out on the reservation, so I don't know a lot about their medical histories.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. That gives me a good starting point. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your overall neurological function. It will just take a few moments.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Do as you need to. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I’ve had my share of doctors over the years, Korean War and all. A good examination is a good thing. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold, my old bones get chilly easily. Proceed when you’re ready. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. … 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not significantly concerning given your anxiety about the examination and your reported history of hypertension. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi are heard. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination is intact. Gait is steady, with no significant abnormalities observed. Alright, Mr. Tkac. Overall, your physical examination is within normal limits for your age, with the exception of slightly elevated blood pressure. Everything else appears to be functioning as it should. Now, do you have any concerns that you want to discuss about your current symptoms or past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, that’s good to hear, Doctor. Reassuring, actually. The blood pressure, that’s not surprising. I get a bit worked up easily, you know. Always have. And I worry about my niece. She's such a good girl, always looking after me. No, I don’t think I have any other concerns at the moment. You've examined me thoroughly, and I appreciate that. I guess… I'm mostly just worried about being a bother. About needing help. I’ve always been independent, you see. A proud Lakota man. And the thought of being… reliant on others… it’s hard to swallow. But if you think a senior living facility is the right thing, I’m willing to consider it. Just want to make sure I’m still… myself, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Tkac. It’s completely natural to feel apprehensive about losing your independence, and you’ve certainly led a full and capable life. Your concerns are valid, and it's important to address them. Based on my examination and our conversation, I don’t believe a senior living facility is immediately necessary. Your cognitive function appears intact, and you are maintaining good physical health overall. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should address. I recommend we start with some lifestyle modifications, such as a low-sodium diet and regular exercise, if your health permits. We can also discuss medication adjustments if needed. I also want to acknowledge your emotional concerns. Perhaps talking to a therapist or joining a support group could provide you with a safe space to process your feelings about aging and independence. To further clarify your memory concerns, I recommend a brief cognitive assessment test. This will help us rule out any underlying cognitive impairment and provide us with a baseline to monitor any changes over time. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Lifestyle modifications, I can do that. A little less salt, a little more walking. My niece will be pleased to hear that. She’s always nagging me about my diet. And a therapist… well, I’ve never been one for talking about my feelings, but I suppose it couldn’t hurt. If you think it would be beneficial. A cognitive assessment test… yes, I’m willing to take that. If it will ease your mind, and my niece’s, then I’ll do it. Just want to be sure, you see. Just want to be sure I’m still… myself. What does this test involve, Doctor? Is it… difficult?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Tkac. I’m glad you’re open to these suggestions. The cognitive assessment test is quite simple, and it’s not at all difficult. It involves a series of questions and tasks designed to evaluate your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. It’s similar to a puzzle or a short quiz. It will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. The results will help us understand your cognitive function and identify any areas that may require further evaluation. It's not a pass or fail test, and it won’t change anything about your current care. It’s simply a tool to help us monitor your cognitive health over time. I have the forms right here. We can complete it together, if you’d like. And if you prefer, we can schedule a separate appointment for the test, when you’re feeling more relaxed. Does that sound acceptable to you, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Let’s just get it over with, if you don’t mind. I’d rather know one way or the other. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I suppose… I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what I need to do. And if I get stuck… well, don't hesitate to help me along. An old man forgets things, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tkac. I’ll be here to guide you through every step of the way. Don't worry if you have difficulty with any of the questions. It's perfectly normal, and it doesn't mean anything is wrong. Alright, let’s start with this one. “What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. Let me think. It’s August… August 2nd. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly correct, Mr. Tkac. Excellent. Alright, now let’s try this one. “Can you tell me the name of the current president of the United States?
PATIENT: Hmm. That one… That one’s a bit trickier. Let me see… Is it… Biden? Yes, I believe it’s Biden. Joe Biden. Is that correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct, Mr. Tkac. Very good. Alright, now can you tell me the months of the year in reverse order, starting with December?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a tricky one. Let me see… December, November… October, September… August… July… June… May… April… March… February… January! Yes, I believe that’s correct. Did I get them all, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tkac, you got them all perfectly correct! That was excellent. Now, I'm going to say three words, and I want you to try and remember them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I'm ready. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll do my best to remember. Tell me the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, the three words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Try to remember those. Now, I’m going to ask you a few unrelated questions, and then I’ll ask you to recall the three words. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright, Doctor. Apple, Table, Penny. I’m repeating them to myself. Apple, Table, Penny. Unrelated questions, you say? Very well. Ask away. I’ll try to concentrate. Apple, Table, Penny…
DOCTOR: ...Alright, Mr. Tkac. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… Three words… Three words… It’s right on the tip of my tongue… Apple… Yes, I remember Apple! And… Table! Yes, that’s it. Apple and Table… What was the third one…? It’s… it’s… Oh dear. It’s gone. I know there were three, but the third one… I can’t seem to recall it. It’s terribly frustrating. It was something small… something… oh dear. I apologize, Doctor. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tkac. It’s very common to have difficulty with recall, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything is wrong. It could simply be due to stress or distraction. ...Alright, Mr. Tkac, we’ve completed the assessment. Overall, your results are within normal limits for your age, with some mild difficulty with immediate recall. This is not uncommon, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate any underlying cognitive impairment. However, I recommend we monitor your cognitive function over time to ensure there are no significant changes. Based on my examination and the results of the cognitive assessment test, I don’t believe a senior living facility is necessary at this time. However, I recommend we focus on lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities, to help preserve your cognitive function. We can also discuss referral to a neurologist for further evaluation if you’re concerned. Do you have any questions for me, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, Doctor. Very reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. And I appreciate you not immediately suggesting a senior living facility. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Just… thank you. And thank you for being patient with an old man who forgets things. I believe… I believe that will be all for today. Though, perhaps… perhaps you could recommend some mentally stimulating activities? Something to keep the mind sharp, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tkac. There are many activities that can help keep your mind sharp. Reading, puzzles, crosswords, and Sudoku are all excellent options. Engaging in social activities and hobbies that you enjoy can also be beneficial. I can provide you with a list of resources and local organizations that offer mentally stimulating activities for seniors. I also recommend joining a book club or taking a class at the local community center. Here’s a list of local organizations and resources that offer mentally stimulating activities. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with me in six months to monitor your cognitive function. We can also discuss any concerns you may have at that time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. This list is wonderful, thank you. I think I can find something to keep me occupied. Perhaps a good crossword puzzle. And thank you again for your patience and understanding. You’ve put my mind at ease. I'll schedule that follow-up appointment with the receptionist on my way out. Good day to you, Doctor Stilaire. And thank you, once again.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Tkac. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day, and please take care of yourself.
