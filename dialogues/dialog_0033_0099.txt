DOCTOR: Right. Denis Minatra, 67 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about a test I had done… a GI Endo Test, the paperwork called it. The results weren’t quite right, or so I was told, and I thought I should come in and discuss them with you. I received the letter about a week ago, requesting I schedule an appointment.
DOCTOR: A GI endoscopy… yes, I see it here. And you received a letter requesting follow-up. Hmm. Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Can you tell me what the paperwork said was… “not quite right”?
PATIENT: I wish I could be more specific, Doctor. To be honest, the letter used a lot of… well, words I didn’t understand. Something about inflammation, and a small… polyp, perhaps? It wasn’t very clear, and frankly, it worried me a little. I don't have a medical background, so I just saw the words and knew I needed to come and have someone explain it to me. Do you have the results in front of you? Perhaps you could tell me what it means?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I have it here. Inflammation… alright. And a small polyp. Look, these things happen. It doesn’t automatically mean anything dreadful. Let’s see… the report notes some mild esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus. Probably acid reflux, honestly. And a 5mm polyp in the descending colon. It's quite small. Have you had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, acid reflux… yes, I do sometimes get a bit of heartburn, especially after meals. It’s never been terribly bad, just a little burning sensation. I usually take something over-the-counter for it, and it goes away. As for other symptoms… I haven’t really noticed anything different, Doctor. No pain, no changes in my… habits, if you understand what I mean. Just… a little tired sometimes, but I'm 67, so that could be anything. Is the polyp something serious? You said it was small, which is good, but… still. A polyp sounds concerning.
DOCTOR: Well, “concerning” is a strong word. Most polyps are benign, especially small ones like yours. However, polyps can become cancerous over time, which is why we need to investigate. The standard procedure is a colonoscopy, if you haven't already had one recently. It allows us to remove the polyp and send it to pathology for analysis. Are you up-to-date on your colon cancer screenings?
PATIENT: You’re right to ask. I believe it has been a while. I… honestly, I can't recall the last time I had a colonoscopy. It was several years ago, at least. Perhaps ten? I’ve been reasonably healthy, so I didn’t think too much about it. And truthfully, Doctor, I’m a little nervous about the procedure itself. I’ve heard stories… Is it very uncomfortable? And how long does it take to recover? I’d like to know what I'm getting into before I agree to anything.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, yes. Look, it’s not pleasant, but it’s also not as bad as people make it out to be. You'll be sedated – you'll sleep through the whole thing. There's some prep involved – drinking a rather unpleasant liquid to clear your bowels – and you might feel a little bloated afterwards, some mild cramping, perhaps. Recovery is usually pretty quick, a day or so, maybe a bit of fatigue. The alternative – not having it done – is far more concerning. We need to rule out anything serious. I'll order a referral to Dr. Ramirez, she’s very good. I'll also have the clinic schedule a pre-colonoscopy consultation to explain the prep in detail. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining it so thoroughly. Dr. Ramirez, you say? I haven’t heard of her, but if you recommend her, I trust your judgment. And a consultation beforehand is a good idea; it will certainly put my mind at ease a little. The prep… well, I’m not looking forward to that part, but I understand it’s necessary. If it helps to be certain, then I’m willing to do it. Please do go ahead with the referral and the consultation. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the referral to Dr. Ramirez. The clinic will contact you to schedule the consultation. It’s important you follow her instructions exactly regarding the prep. And do let me know if you have any questions before the procedure. Otherwise, we'll review the pathology results once they're available. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I will be sure to follow Dr. Ramirez’s instructions carefully, and I will reach out if any questions come up before the procedure. I appreciate your care. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. You too. And don't hesitate to call if anything arises. Next patient. .
