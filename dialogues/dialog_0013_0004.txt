DOCTOR: Hi Teah, good to meet you. I’m Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hi Chriselda, good to meet you too. It's nice to be here. Well, I'm just in for my regular shots, I guess. Gotta keep up with things, you know? It's been a while since I've been in, so I figured it was time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good planning! It is important to stay up-to-date. Just to be thorough – and because it's been a while – let's quickly go over what those “regular shots” usually are for you, and then I'll ask a few general health questions, okay?
PATIENT: Sounds good. I usually get… hmm. I think the flu shot, and a tetanus booster every ten years? And maybe something for…shingles? Honestly, I forget which ones are which. My husband usually reminds me, but he couldn't make it today.
DOCTOR: No problem at all – that happens! We can definitely figure it out. Okay, so flu and tetanus are good ones to remember. Shingles is important too, especially as we get older. Let me just take a look at your records here… Ah, okay. It looks like you received a flu shot last October, and your last tetanus booster was… eight years ago, so you are due for one. And you received the Shingrix vaccine – that’s the shingles vaccine – a little over a year ago, so you’re all set there for now. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: That sounds about right, yeah. October for the flu... and eight years... my husband did tell me I was due for another tetanus one pretty soon. He's good with dates, that man. I'm terrible with them. Glad you have it written down though! Makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: That’s what we’re here for! Okay, great. So, we can definitely get you updated on your tetanus vaccine today. Before we do that, just to get a complete picture of your health, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any new symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Hmm, new symptoms… let me think. Not really, no. I've got a little bit of arthritis in my knees, that’s been going on for a while, and flares up with the weather. But that’s nothing new. No coughs, no fevers, no aches… just the usual old lady stuff, I guess. Nothing to worry Chriselda, I promise.
DOCTOR: “Old lady stuff,” I hear you! It’s good to know things are generally stable, though. And it’s helpful to hear about the arthritis – how long has that been bothering you, and how much does it impact your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, the arthritis... probably about five years now. Started slow, just a little stiffness in the mornings. Now it's pretty constant, mostly in my knees and sometimes my hands. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it makes it harder, you know? Like, I can still garden, but I can't kneel for very long anymore. And stairs are a bit of a challenge some days. I try to stay active though, that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Staying active is excellent! Have you tried anything specifically for the arthritis – like over-the-counter pain relievers, or any creams or physical therapy?
PATIENT: I've tried a few things. Mostly ibuprofen when it gets really bad. And I use a cream sometimes, the one with the menthol, for the ache. My daughter suggested glucosamine, but I haven't gotten around to trying that yet. No physical therapy, though. Honestly, I'm just trying to manage it on my own for now. I don't want to get into a lot of appointments if I don't have to. It's just… a little bit of stiffness, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Managing things on your own when you can is perfectly reasonable. Okay, we can certainly keep an eye on it. Let’s move on to some other quick questions, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung since I was a little girl. My husband always checks everything when he gets a new prescription, just to be safe. He's a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: That’s good! It’s always helpful to have a safety net. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen when my knees bother me, like I said. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just to make sure I’m getting enough. Nothing else. I try to eat pretty healthy, so I don't really need a lot of supplements. Oh! And sometimes I take a little bit of fish oil, for my heart. My doctor suggested that a few years ago. But that’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed, a multivitamin, and fish oil. Good to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise. Doctor said it was just stress, mostly. He took me off the medicine after a while. Other than that… nothing major. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a brief history of high blood pressure that's currently well-managed with lifestyle changes. That’s good to hear! Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, when I was in my thirties. And I was in the hospital when I had my son, but that was… well, a long time ago! Other than that, nothing major. No other surgeries or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, and delivery of her son. And finally, just a quick question about your family history. Are there any serious medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother had some heart trouble when she got older, but she lived to be eighty-five, so she did okay. And my father had diabetes, but he wasn't very good about taking care of himself. Other than that… not really. A lot of aches and pains, like me! My family is just prone to getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in her mother, and diabetes in her father. Alright, Teah. That gives me a good overall picture of your health. It sounds like you’re generally doing very well, and you’re being proactive about staying healthy, which is fantastic. Now, let's get you updated on your tetanus vaccine. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything looks good. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead, Chriselda. I trust your judgement. I always figured I was pretty healthy, despite a few creaky joints.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, taking a listen to your heart... sounds regular and strong, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear on both sides, good breath sounds. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Pulse is good and strong, blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning given she mentioned some stress and we just discussed a prior history of high blood pressure. I notice some mild swelling and limited range of motion in her knees, consistent with arthritis. Overall, everything sounds and looks good. It’s good you’re managing your arthritis, and we can continue to monitor that. Now, I’m going to give you the tetanus shot. It might feel a little pinch, but it shouldn’t be too bad. Is there anything you'd like me to know before I administer it?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've had it before, so I know what to expect. Just do your thing, Chriselda. I'm not afraid of a little pinch. You've been very thorough, I appreciate that. Makes me feel a lot better knowing everything's alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Alright, that’s done. You might feel a little soreness or redness at the injection site for a few days, but it should go away on its own. Just keep it clean and dry. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Just a little pinch, like you said. Nothing too bad. Yep, feels alright. No dizziness or anything like that. You're very good at this, Chriselda. It hardly hurt at all!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Okay, fantastic. So, you're all caught up on your tetanus vaccine. We’ve discussed your arthritis, and it sounds like you’re managing it well. I recommend continuing to stay active, eat a healthy diet, and monitor your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything really well, Chriselda. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things so clearly. And for not making me feel silly about forgetting what shots I've had! I think I’m all set. Thank you so much for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah! It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Here’s a printout of your updated vaccination record. Have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself!
