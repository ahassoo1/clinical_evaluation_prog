DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pfennig. It is nice to meet you. Oh, my… what was I coming in for? It feels like just yesterday I was… well, I suppose it was yesterday I made the appointment. It’s… abdominal pain, I believe. Quite severe, at times. And… something about… a condition I have? It's terribly frustrating, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s… SLE, I think that’s it. Yes, SLE. Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Yes, SLE – that’s Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. It absolutely rings a bell. It's good you remembered that. And you’re experiencing abdominal pain. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, you know it better than I do, apparently! Yes, Lupus… It feels like a very old friend, a rather unwelcome one, of course. The pain… hmm. It’s… low down, mostly. Like a cramping, but sharp too, sometimes. It comes and goes, but when it comes… well, it takes my breath away. It's hard to describe. It feels… internal, if that makes sense. Not like a bruise, but… deeper. And it’s been… more frequent, I think? Lately. Though, honestly, keeping track of time is… difficult.
DOCTOR: It does sound quite bothersome, and I understand how difficult it can be to keep track of things when you're dealing with pain and the effects of Lupus. “More frequent” is helpful – can you give me a rough idea of how often you’re experiencing this pain compared to, say, a month ago?
PATIENT: Oh, my… a month ago. Let me see… I believe I was visiting my sister then, in… oh, goodness, where was I? Never mind, that's not important. Compared to a month ago… it was… less consistent. A few twinges here and there, easily dismissed. Now, it feels like almost every other day. Sometimes even twice in one day. It doesn’t last long each time, thankfully. Maybe an hour or so, then it fades. But it’s disruptive, to say the least. And… worrying. It feels different this time. More… intense, perhaps? Though, that could just be my imagination. I do tend to fret.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like your imagination, Alese. A change in the pattern of your pain, especially increased frequency and intensity, is certainly something we need to investigate. Let's talk a little bit more about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… reassuring to hear you say that, Doctor. I was wondering if I was simply being overly sensitive. Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I do get rather tired, more so than usual, I suppose. And a little… achy, all over. It’s hard to tell with the Lupus, you know? It makes everything feel… muffled. I've also noticed a bit of… swelling in my ankles, sometimes. Not terribly noticeable, but there. And… oh, dear, I seem to be having a bit of trouble concentrating lately. Which, of course, doesn’t help with remembering things! Is that… is that all connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: It absolutely could all be connected, Alese. Fatigue, generalized aches, ankle swelling, and difficulty concentrating are all symptoms that can be associated with Lupus flares, or even complications related to it. We’ll need to explore this further. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking for your Lupus, or for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a good question. My medications… I have a wonderful home health aide, Beatrice, who helps me with those things. She keeps everything organized. Let me see… I believe I’m on… Plaquenil, yes, definitely Plaquenil. And… something for the pain, occasionally. A stronger one, when it gets really bad. I don’t recall the name, I’m afraid. Beatrice manages all of that. And… a vitamin D supplement, I think. Yes, that's it, I believe. Though, honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I apologize. I really do rely on Beatrice to keep me on track.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Alese. It's very common to have difficulty keeping track of medications, especially with multiple conditions and treatments. We can absolutely verify the full list with Beatrice. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. I don’t think so. I recall… a slight rash once, years ago, from a… a certain type of lotion, I believe. But nothing serious. No known drug allergies, to my knowledge. And I eat almost anything, thankfully. I’ve always enjoyed a good meal. Beatrice is very careful to check everything before I eat it, just in case. She’s a lifesaver, truly. I don’t think I’d manage without her. I’m… rambling, aren’t I? Forgive me.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Alese. You’re providing me with very helpful information. It’s good to know you don't have any known allergies, and it’s wonderful that you have Beatrice to help you. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your ankles for swelling. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. A physical exam is a good idea, absolutely. I trust your judgment completely. Please, do whatever you need to do. I will just… sit here, won't I? And try to relax. Though, I can’t promise I won't fidget. My legs sometimes have a mind of their own. Do let me know if you need me to do anything. And… thank you again for your patience. It’s very kind of you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally for me, Alese. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I'm noticing some mild tenderness in your lower quadrants. No rebound tenderness or guarding. And finally, I'm checking your ankles. I do see some mild swelling, as you mentioned, with some pitting edema. It’s not severe, but it’s worth noting. Alright, that concludes the exam. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, your symptoms, and the changes you've described, it sounds like you may be experiencing a Lupus flare. The abdominal pain, fatigue, and increased swelling are all consistent with that. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, just to be sure. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and some inflammatory markers, like ESR and CRP. We’ll also check your kidney function, as Lupus can sometimes affect the kidneys. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A flare… that doesn’t sound pleasant. But I suppose it was to be expected, eventually. It’s been rather quiet lately, perhaps too quiet. Blood work sounds… sensible, yes. Very sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. I just… I want to feel better. I want to be able to enjoy my days again. I’ve been… missing out on things. It’s silly, I know, but… Will the blood work tell you how bad it is? And… will there be something you can do about it? I’m not fond of being poked, but… if it helps, I’ll endure it. I just want to understand what’s happening, and… what comes next.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Alese. It's not silly at all. You absolutely deserve to feel better and enjoy your days. The blood work will help us assess the extent of the inflammation and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. It will also give us a baseline to monitor your response to treatment. The tests will tell us how active the Lupus is currently, and whether any of your organs are being affected. Based on the results, we can adjust your medications if needed. We might consider increasing your Plaquenil dose, or adding a short course of corticosteroids to help reduce the inflammation quickly. We'll discuss all the options carefully before making any decisions. In the meantime, it's important to rest as much as possible, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activities. And please, don't hesitate to contact me if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the blood work results and discuss a plan moving forward. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Rest, hydration… those are things I can manage, I believe. And I will certainly contact you if anything changes. A follow-up appointment in one week… yes, that’s good. Gives me something to look forward to, in a way. Knowing we’re taking steps to address this… it’s reassuring. Thank you. Truly. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. And… I hope these tests don't take too long. I have a book club meeting next Tuesday, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. A silly thing, perhaps, but… it’s a nice distraction. I'm terribly behind on the reading, though. Do you read, Doctor?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. I’m glad I could help. And don’t worry about the tests taking too long – we'll get the results back as quickly as possible. Book club sounds lovely! And missing the reading is perfectly understandable. Yes, I do enjoy reading when I have the time. I’m currently reading a historical novel. It’s a nice escape. Alright. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they’ll be able to assist you with scheduling the blood work. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… delightful. A historical novel… I used to read a great deal of history, years ago. Perhaps I should revisit that. No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been wonderfully thorough, and… I feel much better already, just knowing we have a plan. Oh! One small thing… I seem to have misplaced my glasses case. It’s rather embarrassing, but… I was wearing them earlier, and now… well, you see the situation. I apologize for the inconvenience. Perhaps it’s under the chair? Or… somewhere nearby? I’m terribly forgetful, as you know. But… thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. For everything. You've been a lifesaver. Truly.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Alese. Let’s take a quick look around. Here you are! It was hiding just between the chair and the wall. It happens to the best of us. Don't worry about it. Alright. Well, I’m glad I could help. Remember to rest, stay hydrated, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, Alese, and enjoy your book club meeting! .
