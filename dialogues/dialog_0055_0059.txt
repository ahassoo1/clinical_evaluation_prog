DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, honestly, it's a bit difficult to explain. People have been saying my speech hasn’t been very clear lately. It’s… slurred, I think is the word they used. I don’t really recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: I see. “Slurred speech,” you say. And you haven’t been able to pinpoint a specific time when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. It’s… fuzzy. Like a dream, almost. I just… noticed more people were asking me to repeat myself. And my husband mentioned it a few times. He said it was becoming more frequent. I don’t remember when it went from occasional to frequent though, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are… not uncommon, but certainly make establishing a timeline challenging. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Everything feels… normal, mostly. I’ve been working, same as always. Construction management, you know? Lots of… paperwork, meetings, being on site. Nothing particularly stressful, if that’s what you mean. I think my balance has been a little off sometimes, but I thought that was just from being tired. I really can't be certain. It’s all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Construction management… physically demanding work, then. And you’ve noticed some imbalance, perhaps related to fatigue. Are you experiencing any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… not that I’ve noticed, Doctor. I mean, I’m always a bit sore after a long day, but that’s just part of the job. Nothing… sudden or alarming. I haven't dropped anything, or tripped more than usual. My husband hasn’t mentioned anything about that, either, and he usually notices these things. I really wish I could be more specific, I'm sorry. It’s just… difficult to remember details.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Swaby. We will do our best to piece things together. Now, let’s move onto other areas. Have you experienced any headaches recently?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, actually. I get them sometimes. Not often, but maybe… once or twice a week? They’re not terrible, usually just a dull ache. I usually take something over-the-counter and it helps. I haven’t been keeping track, if that makes sense. They just… come and go. I don’t remember them being worse recently, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really thought about it. I wear glasses, you know, for distance. I got them checked last year, I think? No, wait… it might have been two years ago. I haven't noticed anything… blurry, or double vision, or anything like that. Everything seems… normal. I’m really sorry I can’t be more helpful. It's just hard to recall specifics when everything feels… distant.
DOCTOR: It’s… acceptable, Ms. Swaby. We'll proceed systematically. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing conditions… let me think. I have Medicare, so I must have something listed, but honestly, I don't recall what it is. I’m married, and generally healthy, I suppose. I haven't been to the doctor much in the past few years. No major illnesses, as far as I know. I think I had high blood pressure once, but it went down with diet and exercise. It was a long time ago. My husband handles most of the medical paperwork. I'm truly sorry I can't give you a clear answer.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly access your records through Medicare. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. That’s the only thing I can recall, definitely. And… I think I had a minor procedure on my knee years ago, a sports injury, but it wasn’t serious. Nothing major. I’m sorry, I wish I could remember more details. It’s just… frustrating. Everything feels like a distant memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any reactions to anything I’m aware of. No food allergies, no reactions to insect bites… nothing that I can recall, anyway. I don’t take any medications regularly. My husband will confirm that, I’m sure. He’s very good with remembering these things. It's just… my memory hasn’t been the best lately.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a difficult one. My parents… they both passed away a while ago. My mother… she had heart problems, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. But honestly, I don't remember many specifics. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very involved with their medical care. I have a brother, but we don't speak much. I'm sorry I can't provide more information. My memory is… hazy, at best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol—maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always been very health-conscious, generally. I just… this slurred speech is so worrying, because it’s not something I would expect from my lifestyle. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. That is helpful to know. Now, Ms. Swaby, I’d like to perform a brief neurological examination to assess your speech, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do. I just… want to figure out what’s going on. Please, go ahead. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please follow me to the examination table. First, I'd like you to state your name and today's date, to assess your cognitive function. Then, I’ll have you follow a few simple instructions.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My name is Adyn Swaby. And today is… August 2nd, 2025. I hope I remembered that correctly. It’s funny, even remembering the date feels a little… effortful, today. I’ll do my best to follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Now, can you repeat after me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
PATIENT: “The… quick b-brown… fox jumps ov-over… the la-lazy… dog.” It feels… strange saying that. Like my tongue is… heavy. Did that sound alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It was slightly slurred, Ms. Swaby. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger. Then, I'll move my finger, and I want you to follow it with your finger, maintaining your eyes closed.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’ve touched my nose. I'm ready when you are. I hope I don’t bump into anything.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger with your finger, please. Keep your eyes closed.
PATIENT: Um… this is… difficult. I’m trying, Doctor. It feels… so strange not being able to see where my hand is going. I keep… losing track.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. You can open your eyes now. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Please stand up and try to stand still for 30 seconds. Do not use your hands for balance. I will be right here if you need me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Trying… trying to stand still. This… feels precarious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby, you can sit down. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. I hope this isn’t too concerning. It's just… unsettling to feel so uncoordinated. Please, proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Based on this brief examination, I'm concerned about potential neurological issues. While it’s too early to determine a definitive diagnosis, these findings warrant further investigation. We need to rule out several possibilities. I'd like to order an MRI of the brain, and I'd also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist? That… sounds serious, Doctor. What are you thinking it could be? I mean, I understand you need to investigate, and I trust your judgement. But… is it something to be very worried about? And what does this all mean? I’m a bit overwhelmed, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Swaby. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed. The symptoms you’re experiencing—slurred speech, imbalance, and some difficulty with coordination—can be caused by a number of factors. The MRI will help us visualize your brain and identify any structural abnormalities. A neurologist specializes in the nervous system and can perform more detailed tests to pinpoint the cause. Potential causes could range from something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency, to something more serious, such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis, or even a tumor. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. We need the results of the MRI and the neurologist’s evaluation before we can make any definitive diagnosis. I’m ordering the MRI as a precaution to rule out the more serious possibilities and to ensure we provide you with the appropriate care. I will personally discuss the results with you as soon as they are available, and we will develop a treatment plan together. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that makes a little sense. It's… frightening, to be honest. A stroke… a tumor… those are very scary words. But you’re right, I suppose. It's best to know, even if it’s something bad. And I appreciate you being honest with me, Doctor. I trust your judgement. So… what happens next? How long will it take to get the MRI, and when can I see the neurologist? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could clarify, Ms. Swaby. Let’s discuss the next steps. I’m going to write a referral for the MRI, and my office will contact you to schedule the appointment. It typically takes a few days to get an appointment, perhaps within a week. Once the MRI is completed, the results will be sent to both me and the neurologist. I’ll also write a referral for a neurologist. Dr. Evelyn Reed is an excellent neurologist, and my office will contact you to schedule an appointment once you've scheduled the MRI. In the meantime, it’s crucial that you avoid any strenuous activity, and I advise against driving. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as sudden headache, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty swallowing—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. As a precaution, I'm also going to prescribe a Vitamin B12 supplement, as deficiency can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Avoiding strenuous activity and no driving… I can definitely do that. And the Vitamin B12, yes, please. Thank you for being so thorough. I really appreciate you taking my concerns seriously. This is all a bit overwhelming, but I feel… a little bit better knowing we’re taking steps to figure it out. What should I expect when I see the neurologist? And is there anything I should bring with me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. It's my job to ensure you receive the best possible care. When you see Dr. Reed, she will likely ask a more detailed history of your symptoms, conduct a more comprehensive neurological examination, and review the MRI results with you. She may also order additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies or an evoked potential test, depending on her findings. It’s helpful to bring a list of any medications you’ve taken, even over-the-counter ones, as well as a list of any allergies you have. If possible, it’s also helpful to bring a family member or friend with you, as they can help you remember the details of the appointment and assist with any questions you may have. It is also good to write down all of your symptoms, and the timeline for when they occurred, to help Dr. Reed. Does that sound helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s very helpful. Medications, allergies, symptoms timeline… and bring someone with me. I’ll definitely do all of that. My husband will come with me, he's very good at remembering things. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the MRI appointment, and try not to worry too much. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Before I leave?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Swaby. As I mentioned before, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms - a severe headache, sudden vision changes, weakness, difficulty swallowing or speaking - please do not hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Even if it turns out to be nothing serious, it's always best to err on the side of caution. I’m also going to give you a pamphlet with information about stroke symptoms, just as a reminder. Remember, these are just precautionary measures. We need to gather more information before we can determine the cause of your symptoms. And, feel free to call my office if you have any questions or concerns between now and your appointments. My staff is here to help. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve put my mind at ease, even with all of the uncertainty. Thank you again for taking my concerns so seriously. I’ll wait for the MRI appointment, and I’ll be sure to bring my husband and all of the information you mentioned. I appreciate your help, Doctor Eaddy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll work through this together. I wish you and your husband all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you once they are available. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call my office if you need anything. Goodbye, Ms. Swaby.
