DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I've been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes me a while.
DOCTOR: Difficult to start… and takes a while. Alright. Can you elaborate on that a bit for me?
PATIENT: Well, I feel like I have to go, like a normal feeling, but when I try… nothing happens right away. I have to… push a little. And sometimes it's just a weak stream. It’s been going on for maybe a month now, I'd say. Definitely not getting better. I remember noticing it around the Fourth of July, we had a big family picnic… though it might have been a bit before that.
DOCTOR: So, a month or so. Difficulty initiating urination, requiring straining, and a weak stream. Is it painful when you try to go?
PATIENT: No, not exactly painful. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like something is blocking it, maybe? And afterwards, I don't feel like I’ve emptied my bladder completely, if that makes sense. Like there's still some left in there. I always have to go back a little while later.
DOCTOR: Alright, discomfort, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and needing to return shortly after urinating. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… the color seems normal, I guess. I haven’t really paid close attention. The smell… no, not that I’ve noticed. I drink a lot of water, so it's usually pretty clear. Maybe a little more frequent trips to the bathroom overall, but I thought that was just from the water. I do remember a little bit of cloudiness once or twice, but that was after I had a lot of dairy. I had some cheese with my pierogi last week.
DOCTOR: Cloudiness after dairy… alright. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. My back is a little achy sometimes, but that’s just my age, I think. I have arthritis in my lower back, Doctor. It flares up now and then. No pain in my side, though. Just the usual aches and pains, really. I take ibuprofen for it. I've been taking it for years, actually. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen for arthritis… yes, that's relevant. Do you know the dosage and how often you take it?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… usually two tablets, 200 milligrams each, two or three times a day when it’s really bothering me. Sometimes just once a day if it's not so bad. I try not to take it too often, you know? It's not good for your stomach. I always take it with food. My daughter, she's a nurse, told me to always do that. I’ve been doing that for a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen 400-600mg as needed, taken with food. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Hmm. Not really, no. Everything seems pretty normal there. Maybe a little constipated sometimes, but that happens. I try to eat enough fruit, but it’s not always easy. I used to drink prune juice, but it’s not very tasty, so I stopped. Nothing major has changed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant changes in bowel habits. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh yes, let me think. I have high blood pressure, Doctor. I’ve been on medication for it for about ten years now, I think. Lisinopril, I believe it is called. And…arthritis, as I mentioned before. And I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, when I was in my forties. I don’t really have any other problems, I don’t think. Nothing major, anyway. My daughter keeps telling me I should write all this down… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with Lisinopril. History of gallbladder removal. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a child, but I haven't been stung in many years. And no problems with any medications, as far as I can remember. I've taken a lot of different things over the years, but never had a bad reaction. I always tell my pharmacist everything I'm taking, just in case. My husband… he had a lot of allergies, so I’m very careful. He's gone now, though. Passed away five years ago.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril and ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Let me see… sometimes I take a little something for sleep. Melatonin, it’s called. Just when I can’t fall asleep. It’s a small dose, only five milligrams. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were low. Oh, and sometimes a little something for my arthritis, when the ibuprofen isn’t enough. It’s a cream, Voltaren gel. I rub it on my lower back. That's about it, I think. Is that too much? I don’t want to be taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Melatonin 5mg PRN for sleep, Vitamin D supplement, Voltaren gel. Okay. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle… do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked. My husband did, for a long time, but he quit years before he passed away. It's terrible for your health, you know. I always told him that. And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, on a special occasion. Nothing regular. I prefer tea, actually. Herbal tea. It's much better for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol. And finally, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like prostate problems, kidney disease, or bladder cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. My father had high blood pressure, like me. And my brother had some problems with his kidneys when he was older. He needed dialysis for a while. As for other things… my mother had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had bladder cancer, a long time ago. She didn't live very long after that. It was very sad. Does that matter? I always worry about getting what my family had.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Based on what you've told me – your difficulty initiating urination, weak stream, sensation of incomplete emptying, history of high blood pressure, family history of kidney disease and bladder cancer, and your medication list – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. Now, this is more common in men, but women can experience similar issues due to changes in the bladder and urethra. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. I also want to do a post-void residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. And, given your family history, I'd like you to have a kidney function test. I may also refer you to a urologist for further evaluation. Does that sound alright?
