DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It's been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That’s good of you to come in and have it checked. When you say "a little while," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably around three months, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t painful at first, so I didn’t rush to come in. It’s only recently that I’ve started to feel some discomfort, a sort of dull ache.
DOCTOR: Three months, okay. And the discomfort – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not there all the time. It seems to be worse after I’ve been on my feet a lot, or if I’ve been doing anything strenuous, like… well, I do a lot of dancing, choreography, so maybe when I’ve been very active.
DOCTOR: Dancing, that's good to know. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is the lump located?
PATIENT: If you don’t mind me saying, it’s… well, it’s on my right side, a bit below my belly button. Not right on the belly button, but a few inches down and to the right. It’s hard to describe precisely.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, describing location can be tricky. A few inches down and to the right of your belly button. Has the size of the lump changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Yes, I think it has. It was quite small at first, barely noticeable, really. Now, it feels… bigger. Not dramatically, but definitely larger than it was three months ago. It’s become harder to ignore, which is why I’m here now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's grown somewhat over the past three months. And you mentioned a dull ache associated with activity. Have you noticed any other symptoms – any changes in your bowel habits, any weight loss, fever, nausea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, Doctor. My bowel habits are normal, no changes there. And my weight is stable, I haven't lost any weight. No fever or nausea either. It's really just the lump and the occasional discomfort. I feel otherwise healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen and feel the area to get a better sense of the lump. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy. I’m just going to press gently on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. …Alright. I do feel a firm mass in your right lower abdomen, consistent with where you described it. It’s approximately… 3 centimeters in diameter. It doesn't appear to be particularly painful to the touch, though you might feel some discomfort. Your abdomen is soft otherwise, no signs of guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, we need to investigate this further. There are a number of possibilities. It could be a hernia, a lipoma, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend. A complete blood count too, yes. I’d like to know what’s going on, of course, so I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Are those tests usually covered by Medicare? I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Amy. Yes, both a complete blood count and a CT scan should be covered by Medicare, though there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. I'll have the scheduling department verify your coverage before we proceed, just to be certain. In the meantime, I'm going to write up the orders for the tests. I’ll also give you a referral to a general surgeon, Dr. Elara Vance. She’s excellent, and if the CT scan reveals something concerning, she’ll be the one to discuss potential next steps, including possible biopsy or removal. Would you prefer to see her regardless of the CT scan results, or only if something is found?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Perhaps it’s best to see Dr. Vance only if the CT scan shows something concerning. I’d rather not trouble her unnecessarily if it turns out to be something minor. I trust your judgment on that, Doctor. If you think I should see her regardless, of course, I will. But if it’s a minor issue, I’d prefer to avoid an extra appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds reasonable. We'll proceed with the CT scan first, and if the results warrant it, we’ll schedule an appointment with Dr. Vance. I’m also going to document your history of present illness, review of systems, and the physical exam findings. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing at all. I’m very fortunate in that regard. Is there anything else you need from me at this point?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. I generally try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to manage things naturally, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And just to confirm, you said you do a lot of dancing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Choreography is my profession. I teach and perform. It keeps me quite active, as you can imagine. I’ve been dancing since I was a child. It's my passion, and thankfully, it hasn’t caused me too many problems until now.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. It’s good to stay active. Alright, Amy, I think that covers everything for now. I'm going to go ahead and write the orders for the complete blood count and the CT scan. The scheduling department will contact you to arrange those appointments. We’ll get the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, and I’ll give you a call to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my questions. I appreciate your patience and your clear explanations. I’m feeling much better now that we have a plan in place. Thank you very much for your help. I'll wait to hear from the scheduling department.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or if anything changes before your appointments. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again. Goodbye.
