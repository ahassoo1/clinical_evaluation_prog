DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Genard. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Hmm... well, it's... something down there. It's... leaking. Yeah, leaking. Not good, you know? I don't know what it is, but it’s been happening for a few days now. It's kinda embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: “Leaking,” you say. I understand it’s a delicate matter, Ms. Genard, and you needn’t feel embarrassed discussing it with me; it’s precisely what I’m here for. To clarify, could you describe the leakage a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Precise? Oh, goodness. I don't do precise. It's... wet. And kinda smelly, if I'm being honest. Not a good smell. Like... old fish, maybe? I dunno. It's just... coming out. I haven't been with anyone, if that matters. It just started happening, outta nowhere. It's not like me, you know? I keep myself clean.
DOCTOR: “Out of nowhere,” you say. And you haven’t experienced any pain or discomfort alongside this leakage?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little itchy sometimes, but that could be anything, right? I live by the ocean, lots of sandflies. It’s more the… the mess, you know? And the smell. It worries me. I don't want people to notice. I used to be a pretty lady.
DOCTOR: I see. And to confirm, you’ve not noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, urgency, burning sensation – anything unusual at all in that regard?
PATIENT: Urination? Oh… well, I go when I need to go. Same as always, I think. I mean, maybe I've been going a little more often, but I drink a lot of water. It's hot here, you know? Always hot. And no burning. Definitely no burning. I’d know if there was burning.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Genard, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing this. It will involve an external examination of the pelvic area. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh dear. You want to… look at it? Well, I suppose so. If you have to. But be quick about it, alright? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And try not to make a face, if you can. It's kinda embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as efficient and discreet as possible. Please lie down on the examination table and drape yourself with the sheet I will provide. I will need to visually inspect the area and may gently palpate to assess for any abnormalities. Before we begin, can you confirm your allergy status?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I used to be allergic to cats, but I haven't seen a cat in years. And sometimes my skin gets itchy from certain soaps, but that's all. Nothing serious, you know? No bee stings or anything like that. Just a little itchy sometimes. Oh, and I don't like mangoes, but that's a taste allergy, not a real one!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you would please lie down on the examination table. External genitalia appear erythematous with mild edema. No visible lesions or excoriations noted. Palpation reveals no palpable masses or tenderness. Odor present, consistent with your description of a fishy scent. Speculum exam not indicated at this time, given your history. Internal exam is not necessary. Based on my examination, the most likely cause is bacterial vaginosis. It's a common condition, often caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina.
PATIENT: Bacterial… what-now-sis? Is that… bad? Will I die? I don't understand all these big words, Doctor. Is it… catching? I don't want to give it to anyone.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, you will not die. Bacterial vaginosis – BV – is not life-threatening. It's a common infection, and it's easily treatable. As for being "catching," it's not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense, though it’s more common in sexually active women. It's an imbalance of naturally occurring bacteria, and it’s usually not something you “give” to someone. We will treat it with a course of oral metronidazole. It’s an antibiotic. You’ll take two 500mg tablets twice daily for seven days. I will provide you with a printed prescription and detailed instructions. It is crucial you complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if your symptoms improve before the seven days are up.
PATIENT: Antibiotics… hmm. I don’t like taking pills. They always make my stomach upset. And seven days is a long time. Are there… other options? Maybe a cream or something? I really don’t want to be sick on top of everything else. And what about the smell? Will it go away right away?
DOCTOR: While topical treatments exist, they are generally less effective for BV and have a higher recurrence rate. Oral metronidazole remains the gold standard. To minimize stomach upset, I recommend taking the medication with food. As for the odor, it should begin to subside within a few days of starting the antibiotics, but complete resolution may take up to a week. If the odor persists beyond that, or if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, pelvic pain, or abnormal discharge – you must contact me immediately. Here are your instructions and the prescription. Please read through the material carefully. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh, a week... Alright, alright. I guess pills are better than smelling like old fish. And I really don't want to be sick. Is there anything I should… avoid? Like certain foods or drinks? I like my mango juice, but if I have to… And what if it comes back? You said it might? Oh dear. I don't want this to be something I have to deal with forever.
DOCTOR: While on metronidazole, it is advisable to avoid alcohol consumption, as it can cause a disulfiram-like reaction – nausea, vomiting, headache. As for mango juice, there's no direct contraindication, but I recommend moderating your intake, given your sensitivity. Regarding recurrence, it is unfortunately common. About 30% of women experience a recurrence within three months. To minimize the risk, avoid douching, use mild, unscented soaps, and wear cotton underwear. Probiotics may also be helpful, though the evidence is limited. If the infection recurs, we can discuss further preventative measures. I will also provide a referral to a local gynecologist for follow-up care, should you desire it. It is prudent to establish a relationship with a specialist for ongoing monitoring. Do you have any other questions before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: A gynecologist? Oh dear. More doctors? That just sounds… complicated. I don’t know… I’m an old lady, Doctor. I just want it gone. I guess… no alcohol. And cotton underwear. I can do that. But I still don’t like the idea of it coming back. Is there… anything I can do? Besides pills and underwear? Like, a special soap or something? Or a… a lucky charm?
DOCTOR: While there is no scientific evidence to support the use of “lucky charms,” maintaining good hygiene is paramount. As for special soaps, avoid anything heavily fragranced or containing harsh chemicals. A gentle, pH-balanced cleanser is preferable. Ultimately, Ms. Genard, proactive self-care and adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen are the most effective strategies. If you experience any unusual symptoms, or if you are concerned about a recurrence, do not hesitate to contact me or seek immediate medical attention. I believe we have covered all pertinent aspects of your condition today. Here is the referral information for the gynecologist. I wish you a swift recovery.
PATIENT: Well… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I think. Pills and underwear… and no mango juice. What a bother.
