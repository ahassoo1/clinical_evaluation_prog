DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been having. It's been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little while now… could you tell me a bit more about that pain?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s mostly in my… well, it's hard to say exactly where. It feels like it's deep inside, you know? Not like a surface ache. And it comes and goes. Some days it's barely there, other days… well, other days it makes it hard to do things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Deep inside, comes and goes… That helps. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It's not really sharp, more like a dull ache, a constant pressure, almost. Sometimes it feels like a squeezing. And it radiates… goes down my back a little, I think. But it's hard to be sure. It's just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, constant pressure, sometimes squeezing, and radiating to your back. And you said it's been happening for a "little while now". Roughly how long is "a little while"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe three, four months now? It started off pretty mild, I barely noticed it, just a little stiffness after I'd been sitting for a long time. But it's definitely gotten worse over the last month or so. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured it was just getting old, you know? But now… it's making it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. Three or four months, gradually worsening, now impacting your sleep. That's important information. Besides the pain and trouble sleeping, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have been feeling a little tired lately. But honestly, at my age, who isn't tired, right? I haven't noticed anything else really. No fever, no numbness, no weakness… just the pain and the tiredness. I have been eating okay, I think. My wife does most of the cooking, so I’m not really sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, numbness, or weakness. Just pain and some fatigue. And your wife handles most of the cooking, so dietary changes haven’t been specifically noted. Do you have any problems with your bowel movements or bladder control?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… well, no, not really. Everything seems… normal there, if you don't mind me saying so. Nothing out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright to share. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, nothing major. The doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a little high, but he said to just watch my diet. That’s about it, really. No diabetes, no heart problems… just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, mildly elevated cholesterol, but otherwise no major medical diagnoses. And you haven't been to the doctor recently. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Everything’s still original, if you know what I mean! My wife always jokes I'm too stubborn to let anyone near me with a scalpel.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother had heart problems when she was older, I think. And my father had… well, I think he had some kind of cancer, but it was a long time ago and I don’t remember the details. My wife would probably know more about that. She keeps track of all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease and cancer. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I try to avoid them if I can. I believe in letting my body do its own thing, you know? Just a few vitamins sometimes, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life! My wife sometimes jokes I'll try anything once. No allergies, no reactions… nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine with me, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your abdomen, and finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just feels like… a normal pressing, I guess. A little uncomfortable, maybe, but no pain. It's a little tender right… here, on the left side, but not really painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness on the left side. Alright. And now I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are normal. Now, could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, squeezing… Is that enough? I don't want to overdo it.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Your grip strength is good. Everything seems to be normal so far. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect musculoskeletal pain, possibly related to muscle strain or a minor injury. However, because of the tenderness in your left upper quadrant and your age, I want to be cautious. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will rule things out, then yes, please. I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know? Blood work sounds good. What kind of blood work are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm ordering a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a lipase level. The CBC will check for infection or anemia, the CMP will assess your kidney and liver function, and the lipase level will help rule out pancreatitis. It’s a pretty standard set of tests. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as directed on the label. Avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates the pain. And if the pain gets worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, nausea, or vomiting, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a bit overwhelming, but I understand. CBC, CMP, lipase… I’ll try to remember all that. And yes, I’ll take the pain relievers and try to rest. No strenuous activity. And contact you if things get worse. Actually, yes, I do have one question. Pancreatitis… is that serious? It sounds… scary.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Pancreatitis can be serious, but it’s also treatable. The pancreas is an organ that helps with digestion. When it becomes inflamed, it can cause severe abdominal pain. We're ordering the lipase level just to rule it out as a possibility. It doesn't mean you have pancreatitis, just that we're being thorough. It’s much more likely that your pain is due to a muscle strain or something similar. But it’s always best to rule out the more serious possibilities first. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and we can discuss them then. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers it. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to… well, to listen to an old man complain! I’ll take it easy, get the blood work done, and wait for the results. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. It’s my job to listen, and I'm happy to help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s a printed summary of today’s visit and the lab orders. I’ll see you back in a few days. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too.
