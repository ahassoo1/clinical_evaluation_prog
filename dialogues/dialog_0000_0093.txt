DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Redfern, have a seat. Twenty-nine, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Twenty-nine. Though honestly, time… it all kinda blurs together, you know? Not that it matters much. Just figured you needed the number for the forms.
DOCTOR: It matters to me, Mr. Redfern. Age is… relevant. Now, let’s not get philosophical. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Doctor… Batara, is it? Someone mentioned something about not sleeping well. And, I dunno, feeling… not exactly bad, just… not good. Like a badly tuned instrument, I suppose. Which is ironic, isn’t it? I fix them for a living. Don't really remember who suggested I come here, though. It was probably my wife... before.
DOCTOR: Before?
PATIENT: Yeah. She… passed a while back. Doesn't matter now. Point is, she was always fussing over my health. Probably told someone I needed to get checked out. Said I wasn't looking after myself. Always did have a good ear for… everything, she did. Still, I'm here now, aren’t I? Mostly because it's… quiet when I'm alone, and I just… don’t sleep. Not a big deal, really.
DOCTOR: Not a big deal?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a practical man, alright? I deal with vibrations, frequencies, things that are wrong. A little sleeplessness isn’t going to ruin my life. It just… means I have more time to, well, not sleep. It’s not like I’m falling apart or anything. I eat, I work… I function. Maybe I'm just not built to need a lot of rest. Some instruments are just louder than others, you know? And they don’t need oiling every five minutes.
DOCTOR: “Functioning” isn’t the same as healthy, Mr. Redfern. And I suspect there’s more to this than just a lack of sleep. When did this start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn't tell you. It’s been… a gradual thing. Like a string slowly going out of tune. One day you notice it’s a little flat, the next it’s completely off. Months, maybe? Years? It all kinda blends together, like I said. After… everything, things just… lost their definition. I really don't keep track of dates anymore. Does it matter how long it’s been? If I can still repair a Stradivarius, what difference does it make?
DOCTOR: It matters because chronic sleep deprivation can have very serious consequences, Mr. Redfern. Let's try to be precise. Has anything changed in your life around the time you noticed this increasing difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… I stopped taking on apprentices. Too much trouble, really. They never appreciate the… nuance. And I guess I’ve been… more solitary. Used to have a few friends come by, but… it's easier to concentrate without distractions. No, nothing major. Just… adjustments. Like tightening a bridge on a cello. You tweak things here and there to get the right sound. It doesn't mean the whole instrument is broken. And truthfully, I don’t remember anything being particularly different before… before she went. Just… less quiet, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Less quiet." So, the loss of your wife… you’re saying that hasn’t affected you?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not saying it was… pleasant, alright? Obviously not. But I'm a practical man. Things break. Instruments need repair. People… pass on. It’s the natural order of things. Dwelling on it doesn’t fix anything. It just makes the workshop… more depressing. I threw myself into my work, that’s all. Focused on the vibrations, the wood, the mechanics. It's… concrete. Unlike… feelings. And, honestly, it's been a long time. You get used to things, I suppose. It doesn't mean I don't notice she's gone, just that… it's become part of the background hum, like a low frequency resonance. It’s always there, but you learn to filter it out. Doesn’t mean I’m not functional.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, with all due respect, that sounds… remarkably detached. And frankly, concerning. Let’s move on to some basic medical questions. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? I eat. I work. I don't cough. I don’t sneeze. I haven't broken any bones recently. I suppose… sometimes I feel a little… tired. But that's hardly a symptom, is it? I mean, everyone gets tired. And I get… frustrated, easily. Especially with… subpar instruments. Or people who don’t understand the importance of proper tuning. But that's more of a personality flaw, I think. Really, I'm perfectly alright. Just… not sleeping as well as I used to. It's a minor adjustment, that's all. Like fine-tuning a soundpost. Doesn’t require a whole overhaul.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Let’s try a very simple question. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never really been one for pills and potions. I prefer a good oil and a properly fitted bridge, if you know what I mean. I might have some aspirin in the workshop, for a headache, but that's it. And honestly, I rarely get headaches. Too focused on the vibrations, you see. They drown everything else out. No, no medications. Absolutely none. Just… wood and string and the occasional stubborn soundpost. And a good ear. That's all I need.
