DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Jaylyne. Uh, yeah, it’s good to meet you too. I’ve been having this ringing in my ears… it’s been going on for a little bit now and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jaylyne. It’s good to meet you as well. Ringing in the ears, or tinnitus as we call it, can be quite disruptive. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is! It's… hard to explain. It’s not constant, you know? Sometimes it's just a faint hum, other times it's like a high-pitched whine. It seems to get worse when it's quiet… like at night when I'm trying to sleep. And… sometimes after I’ve been around loud noises, like at work. I’m a waiter, so it can get pretty busy.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s intermittent, varies in pitch, is worse with quiet, and seems to be exacerbated by noise exposure. When did this start, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably about three months ago, I'd say. Maybe a little longer? I didn't think much of it at first, just figured it was from a loud night out with friends. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Three months, alright. And you mentioned a loud night out – have you experienced any other significant noise exposures since then, apart from work?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Just… the usual weekend stuff, you know? Music's a bit loud sometimes where I hang out, but nothing crazy. Work is definitely the biggest thing. We have a pretty lively bar, and I'm usually running around taking orders, being near the speakers and everything. It gets pretty noisy in there, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily noise exposure at work seems to be the main factor. Have you noticed any hearing loss alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Uh… not that I've noticed, no. Everything sounds… normal, I think. I haven’t really tried to test it or anything, if that makes sense. I just haven’t felt like I’m missing anything. I mean, I can still hear people fine, and music sounds normal, too.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you haven’t noticed any difficulty hearing. Let's move on to some other things to help narrow down potential causes. Do you experience any dizziness, vertigo, or a feeling of fullness in your ears alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No dizziness or anything like that. And my ears don't feel blocked or full, thankfully. It’s really just the ringing. It's annoying, but… that’s it. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness or fullness – that's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you had any prior ear infections, sinus problems, or head injuries?
PATIENT: Hmm… ear infections, not since I was a kid, honestly. I think maybe one or two when I was little, but nothing in years and years. Sinus problems, sometimes I get a stuffy nose, especially during allergy season, but nothing major. And… no head injuries, thankfully. Never been in a bad accident or anything like that. I'm pretty careful!
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications at all, thankfully. And allergies… just a little bit of hay fever during the spring and summer. Nothing too bad, I just sneeze a bit. I don’t take anything for it, usually. Just try to stay indoors when it's really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or significant allergies. Do you have a family history of hearing loss or tinnitus?
PATIENT: That's a good question... You know, my grandfather on my mother’s side… he had trouble hearing when he got older. I don’t know if it was tinnitus specifically, but he definitely needed hearing aids for a while. Other than that, not really, no. No one else that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hearing loss in your grandfather. Now, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, or are you regularly exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And thankfully, not much secondhand smoke either. Most places don't allow it these days. I try to stay away from it when I can, anyway. It just smells awful.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, to get a better understanding of your condition, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I will need to look into your ears with an otoscope, and we'll do a quick hearing screening just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on and, hopefully, get some relief. Let's get it over with, if you don't mind. I have work later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jaylyne. I understand. Please have a seat here. First, let's take a look in your ears. Both ear canals appear clear, with normal tympanic membranes. No signs of infection or fluid. Now, let's proceed with a quick hearing screening. Okay, the screening indicates mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. It's not severe, but it is present. It correlates with your reported tinnitus and noise exposure.
PATIENT: Mild hearing loss, huh? Okay… That explains a bit, I guess. So the ringing is because… I’ve damaged my hearing a bit? Is that what you’re saying? What can I do about it? I really don’t want to have to quit my job.
DOCTOR: That's a reasonable interpretation, yes. Prolonged exposure to loud noises, such as those at work, can cause damage to the small hair cells in your inner ear, leading to both hearing loss and tinnitus. The good news is that mild hearing loss is often manageable, and there are several options we can explore to help alleviate your symptoms. Before we discuss those, however, I want to rule out any other potential causes, just to be thorough. I'm going to order a complete audiometry test, which is a more detailed hearing evaluation performed by an audiologist. This will give us a better understanding of the extent and nature of your hearing loss. Would you be open to a referral to an audiologist for this testing?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. If it helps figure things out, then absolutely. A more detailed test sounds good. And… I want to do everything I can to fix this, so yeah, a referral to an audiologist is fine. Is there anything I should… avoid doing in the meantime? Like, at work? Any tips? It’s pretty loud there, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will go ahead and write you a referral to a local audiologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office number and address are on the referral slip. She’s very good and will schedule you for a comprehensive assessment as soon as possible. In the meantime, to minimize further damage at work, I recommend several things. If possible, try to limit your exposure to loud noises. This may mean requesting a different workstation, if available, or taking breaks in quieter areas. Wearing earplugs is highly recommended – even foam earplugs can provide significant protection. There are also custom-molded earplugs available that are more comfortable and offer better noise reduction. Finally, be mindful of the volume levels of any music or speakers around you. I'll also provide you with a handout on tinnitus management strategies, which includes information on relaxation techniques and sound therapy. These can help you cope with the ringing and reduce its impact on your daily life. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… really good, actually. Earplugs, breaks… I can definitely try to do that. Custom molded ones, huh? I'll look into that. And the handout sounds helpful too. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing there are things I can do. So, just schedule an appointment with the audiologist and… try those things at work? Is there anything else I should be aware of? Or anything I should tell the audiologist specifically?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad I could provide some clarity and reassurance. Yes, your next step is to schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma. When you do, please inform her that I referred you and that you are experiencing tinnitus associated with mild high-frequency hearing loss and occupational noise exposure. When you see her, she will conduct a comprehensive hearing evaluation to determine the extent and nature of your hearing loss, and she will discuss potential treatment options, such as hearing aids or tinnitus management therapies. She will also be able to provide you with personalized recommendations for protecting your hearing in the future. I'll also ask you to follow up with me in about six weeks, after you’ve had a chance to see Dr. Sharma, so we can discuss her findings and create a comprehensive management plan. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Six weeks… I’ll mark it in my calendar. I’ll tell Dr. Sharma everything you’ve told me. And I’ll definitely try to protect my hearing in the meantime. Thank you, Doctor. I think that's everything for now. I appreciate your time and help. I’ll see you in six weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could assist you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out sooner if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns. Here is the referral slip and the handout on tinnitus management. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in six weeks.
