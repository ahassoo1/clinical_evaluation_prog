DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see… what brings me in… Well, it’s a bit of a worry, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been after me to come. She says I’ve been… well, having little spells, I suppose. Not often, but enough to make her nervous. And my husband’s mother… she had terrible headaches, and then trouble with her arm… it was a bit frightening. So, here I am. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your daughter encouraged you to come in, and it’s wise to get these things checked out, especially with family history to consider. “Little spells” can mean a lot of different things. Could you describe one of these spells for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… describing them… it’s hard. It feels like… sometimes my hand just feels… heavy. Like I can’t lift it properly. Not completely useless, mind you, just… sluggish. And the other times… well, a headache will come on, a proper throbber, and I feel a little… confused, maybe? Like I’m searching for words. It doesn’t last long, usually. Maybe an hour, if that. Then it just… goes away. It’s just… unsettling, you know? And I worry it's something like what happened to my mother-in-law.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Sluggishness” in your hand and headaches with some confusion—that definitely warrants a closer look. It’s good you’re able to describe it, even if it’s hard to pinpoint. Let’s try to get a more detailed picture. When you say the headache comes on, where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… where do I feel it? Hmm… it’s usually on this side… … right here, around my temple, I think. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… a pressing feeling. Like a tight band around my head, squeezing. And sometimes it radiates… goes to the back of my neck a little. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain these things. I’m not very good with… well, with knowing where things hurt, exactly.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Tofani. A pressing, band-like pain on one side of your head, radiating to the back of your neck – that’s very helpful. And it’s perfectly alright not to be precise with medical terms! We’ll figure it out together. Now, when these spells happen, are there any other symptoms you notice?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… other symptoms… well, sometimes I feel a little… nauseous, maybe? Not enough to actually be sick, just a queasy feeling in my stomach. And… oh! Sometimes, things seem a little… brighter, you know? Like the light is too much. I’ll squint a little. My daughter says I get a little quiet, too. She says I just… stare off into space. I don’t remember that part very well, to be honest. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea and sensitivity to light – those are important things to note. And the quietness your daughter mentioned is helpful as well. It sounds like these spells involve more than just the headache and hand weakness. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… medical history… Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, a long, long time ago. And I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back. Nothing serious, really. Oh! And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, but he put me on a little pill for it. I take that every day. I can’t remember the name of it, though. My daughter manages my pills, mostly. She’s very good at keeping track of things. I don’t think I’ve ever been told I had anything… serious, you know? Just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Tofani. You had your tonsils removed, a bout of the flu, and you’re currently taking medication for high blood pressure. Your daughter managing your medications is excellent – that’s very proactive. Do you know the dosage of the blood pressure medication you’re taking, even if you don’t know the name?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… the dosage… Hmm. Let me see… It’s a little white pill… and… I think it’s… 25? Or maybe 50? I really can’t remember. My daughter, Maria, she knows. She has a list of everything. I just take what she gives me, to be honest. I don’t want to mess things up. It’s all a bit confusing, all these pills and numbers. I’m better at cooking, you know? I make a lovely lasagna.
DOCTOR: Lasagna sounds wonderful, Ms. Tofani. It's perfectly alright that your daughter helps with your medications; it’s good to have support. We can double-check the dosage with your pharmacy later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than your tonsils?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Just the tonsils, when I was a little girl. Hospitalized… hmm. Well, I stayed overnight once when I broke my wrist a long time ago, when I was a teenager. Fell off a bicycle, silly thing. But that was… a very long time ago. Nothing serious, really. Just a cast for a few weeks. No other surgeries or hospital stays that I can remember. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? It’s like… little bits are missing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries besides your tonsils and a brief hospital stay for a broken wrist as a teenager. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or maybe even migraines?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s what my daughter was worried about, wasn't it? Let me see… My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. She was always tired, and she had to take pills for it. And like I said, my husband’s mother… she had terrible headaches. Really awful migraines. She had to lie down in a dark room for hours. And… oh! My brother… he had a stroke a few years back. It left him a little… weak on one side. That’s why my daughter wanted me to come in, I think. She’s very worried about me having the same thing. It’s all a bit frightening, really. I try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. Family history of heart trouble, migraines, and stroke is important to note. It's good your daughter is being proactive, and it’s wise to be aware of potential risks. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. And alcohol… well, I might have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Just a little one. I don’t really care for it much, to be honest. I prefer a nice cup of tea. And I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables and pasta, of course! A good Italian girl always loves her pasta.
DOCTOR: A good Italian girl does love her pasta! That's good to hear. And having only a little wine occasionally is fine. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat all sorts of things. My daughter always makes sure I don’t eat anything I shouldn’t. She's very careful. No allergies, no, thankfully. That would be terrible, wouldn’t it? Having to worry about what you can and can’t eat. I’m lucky, I suppose. I can eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know, Ms. Tofani. No known allergies are very helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... let me think again. Besides the blood pressure pill… hmm. Sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take something for the pain. It’s a little white pill too, I think. My daughter gives it to me when I complain. I don’t know what it’s called, and I don’t know how much I take. Just when my joints get achy. It's not every day, though. Just when I need it. Otherwise, no, I don’t take anything else regularly. It’s mostly just the blood pressure pill and the little pill for my arthritis when it bothers me. I really rely on my daughter to keep track of everything!
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication and a pain reliever for arthritis as needed. That gives us a clearer picture. Now, Ms. Tofani, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long, and it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I’m not very good with… well, with things like exams, but I’ll try my best to cooperate. Just take your time, please. And let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m a bit of a worrier, you know. But I’ll try to be brave.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Tofani. I'll definitely take my time, and I'll explain everything as I go. It’s perfectly alright to be a little worried, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. …Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so, and it's not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep, slow breaths in and out. …Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not a major concern at this point, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. This will involve some simple tests to check your reflexes, coordination, and strength. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… Yes, I think so. It's a little… wobbly, maybe? My eyes aren’t what they used to be, you know. It’s hard to focus sometimes. And my neck… it gets a little stiff. But I’m following your finger, Doctor. I hope that’s alright. It’s just… a little hard to keep my head still. And what did you say about a murmur? Is that… bad? I get a bit anxious when I hear words like that.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that it’s a little wobbly, Ms. Tofani, and it’s good you mentioned the neck stiffness. We'll factor that in. And a murmur isn’t necessarily bad. Many people have innocent heart murmurs, especially as they get older. It just means there’s a slight whooshing sound when your heart beats. We’ll want to monitor it, but it’s not cause for immediate alarm. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap your knee with this little hammer. …Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon with age. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… I’m squeezing… is that alright? It’s a little hard… my hand feels a bit… weak, maybe? Not completely weak, just… not as strong as it used to be. And the other hand… it feels a little… clumsy. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… it doesn’t want to cooperate. Is that what you’re checking? The strength of my hands? I hope I’m doing it right. I always worry about doing things wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Ms. Tofani. And you’re describing it exactly right. I’m checking the strength in your hands, and you’ve noticed the difference yourself. It’s good that you’re aware of these changes. Now, I'm going to check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… I’m walking… it’s a little… wobbly, isn’t it? My legs aren’t what they used to be, you know. I feel a bit… off balance. And my knees… they ache a little. I try to walk straight, but it’s hard. I always worry about falling. Is that what you’re checking? My balance? I hope I’m not making a mess of things. It’s just… a little scary.
DOCTOR: You're not making a mess of anything at all, Ms. Tofani. And yes, I’m checking your balance and gait. It’s good you acknowledge the unsteadiness. It’s a little wider than usual, and slightly slower, and I noticed the ache in your knees. Okay, Ms. Tofani, thank you for letting me do that exam. That gives me a much clearer picture. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, we have a few things to consider. You’re experiencing headaches with some confusion and nausea, and you’ve noticed weakness in your hand, some imbalance, and neck stiffness. The neurological exam shows diminished reflexes and some unevenness in your strength. Given your family history of migraines and stroke, and the symptoms you’re experiencing, I think it’s important to rule out a few potential causes. We need to investigate this further. Would you be comfortable with a few tests, including a blood test to check for inflammation and other markers, and a brain scan – a CT scan or an MRI – to get a better look at your brain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… tests… a brain scan? That sounds… frightening. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I don’t like the sound of that at all. I get so anxious when I hear words like “scan” and “inflammation.” Is it… is it a stroke? That’s what I’ve been worried about all along. My daughter… she’s been so concerned. I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to know what’s going on. But a scan… I don’t know… It sounds… serious. Can’t we just… take something for the headaches? And maybe rest a little? I don’t like the sound of tests… not at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly normal to feel frightened when you hear about tests, especially a brain scan. And I want to assure you, we’re not jumping to conclusions. We're simply being thorough to rule out any serious causes and get to the bottom of what’s going on. We're not diagnosing a stroke at this point. The symptoms you’re describing could be caused by a variety of things, including migraines, a transient ischemic attack , or other conditions. The scan will help us differentiate between these possibilities and determine the best course of action. I wouldn't recommend a scan if I didn't think it was necessary to get you the right diagnosis and treatment. Before we make any decisions, let me explain the scans in a little more detail. A CT scan is quick and painless, like a specialized X-ray. An MRI is a bit longer and uses magnets, but it's also painless. We’ll discuss the risks and benefits of each one, and choose the one that's best for you. Would you like me to go over the potential causes of your symptoms, and what each scan would help us rule out?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… explain the causes, please. That might… calm me down a little. I just… I hate being in the dark. Knowing what we’re looking for… that might make it less scary. And explain the scans again, too. I get so confused when you use those big words. I’m an old woman, you know? My brain doesn’t work as well as it used to. Just… explain it slowly, please. And tell me… is it possible it’s just… a bad migraine? That’s what my daughter keeps saying, but I worry about something more serious. Just… tell me everything. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tofani. I’m happy to explain everything slowly and clearly. And you're right to want to understand what's going on. You deserve to know. Let's start with the potential causes of your symptoms. The most common possibility is a migraine. You've experienced headaches before, and the symptoms you're describing – the throbbing pain, nausea, sensitivity to light – can all be part of a migraine. However, the weakness in your hand and the imbalance are less typical of a migraine, which is why we need to investigate further. Another possibility is a transient ischemic attack, or TIA. It's often called a "mini-stroke." It happens when there’s a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain, causing symptoms similar to a stroke – weakness, confusion, imbalance – but the symptoms usually resolve within a few minutes or hours. A TIA is a warning sign that you might be at risk of a full stroke, which is why it’s important to take it seriously. Less commonly, your symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as a viral infection, a tumor, or a neurological disorder. But these are less likely, given your medical history and the exam findings. Now, let's talk about the scans. The CT scan is like a specialized X-ray of your brain. It’s quick and painless, and it can help us identify any signs of bleeding, swelling, or a tumor. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine, and the scan takes just a few minutes. The MRI is a more detailed scan of your brain. It uses magnets and radio waves to create a detailed image of your brain tissue. It’s a bit longer than a CT scan, usually about 30-45 minutes, and you’ll lie on a table that slides into a long, narrow tube. Some people feel a little claustrophobic in the tube, but we can give you medication to help you relax if needed. The MRI can help us identify any signs of a stroke, a tumor, or other neurological disorders. Do you have any questions about the causes or the scans so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a tumor? That sounds… terrible. I don’t think I could handle that. And a stroke… my brother… it was awful. He couldn’t speak properly for months. I don’t want that to happen to me. And the tube… I don’t like small spaces. I get very anxious. So, the scan will tell us if it’s a tumor or a stroke? And if it’s not those things… what then? What if it’s something else? I just… I hate being in the dark. Knowing what we’re looking for… that’s good. But what if it’s something serious that they can’t fix? I get so worried. My daughter says I worry too much. But I can’t help it. I’m an old woman, you know? I’ve seen a lot of bad things happen. And the medication… will it make me sleepy? I don’t want to be sleepy. I want to be alert. I need to be alert. Just… tell me what the scan will tell us. What are we looking for, exactly? And what if it’s something bad? I need to know. Slowly. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly normal to be scared when you hear about serious possibilities like a tumor or a stroke. And I want to assure you, we’re not jumping to conclusions. We’re simply trying to rule out the most serious causes so we can get you the right diagnosis and treatment. Let’s focus on what the scan will tell us. The primary goal of the scan is to look for any signs of bleeding, swelling, or blockage in your brain. If there’s bleeding or swelling, it could be caused by a stroke or another condition. If there’s a blockage, it could be caused by a stroke or a tumor. If the scan is normal, that doesn’t necessarily mean there’s nothing wrong. It could mean that the cause of your symptoms is less obvious, such as a migraine, a viral infection, or a neurological disorder. In that case, we would need to do further tests to figure out what’s going on. And if the scan does show something abnormal, we would discuss the results with you in detail and explain your options for treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the cause of the problem, but they can include medication, surgery, or therapy. Now, let’s talk about the medication. We can give you a medication to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious about the scan. It’s a mild sedative, and it won’t make you completely sleepy, but it can help you feel more comfortable and less stressed. We can adjust the dose depending on your needs. And what if it's something bad?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... you said "what if it's something bad?" That’s what I’m afraid of. What if it is something bad? What if it’s a tumor? Or a stroke that they can’t fix? What if I lose my ability to speak? Or move? I’ve seen what happens to people with strokes. It’s awful. I don’t want that to happen to me. My daughter says I worry too much, but I can’t help it. I’m an old woman, you know? I’ve seen a lot of bad things happen. And I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter. She’s got her own life. So, if it is something bad… what then? What are the options? What kind of treatment is available? And what are the side effects? I need to know. I need to be prepared. Even if it’s something terrible. Just… tell me everything. Slowly. Please. I need to be prepared for the worst.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way. It's brave of you to face these fears and ask these difficult questions. And you deserve honest answers. Let's talk about the worst-case scenarios, and what options would be available. If the scan reveals a tumor, the treatment options depend on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Options can include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy to shrink the tumor, chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, or a combination of these treatments. The side effects of these treatments vary depending on the specific treatment, but they can include fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and cognitive changes. We would discuss these side effects with you in detail before starting any treatment. If the scan reveals a stroke, the treatment options depend on the type and severity of the stroke. If it's a clot causing the stroke, we can use medication to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the brain. We can also provide therapy to help you regain lost function, such as speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove a blood clot or repair a damaged blood vessel. The side effects of these treatments vary depending on the specific treatment, but they can include bleeding, infection, and cognitive changes. It's important to remember that even if you experience a stroke or have a tumor, there's hope for recovery. Many people with strokes and tumors are able to regain significant function and live full and productive lives. And we would provide you with the best possible care and support throughout the recovery process. I also want to assure you that you wouldn’t be a burden. Your daughter loves you and wants to be there for you. And we would provide you with all the resources you need to manage your health and well-being. Before we move forward, would you like me to call your daughter in to speak with us?
PATIENT: Oh… calling my daughter… yes, that might be good. She’s much braver than me. She asks all the right questions. And she keeps track of everything. I always forget things. Yes, please call Maria. She needs to know what’s going on. And she can ask you the questions I can’t think of. She’s very good at that. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for explaining everything. It’s still scary, but… it’s a little less scary knowing what to expect. Just… call Maria, please. And… thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tofani. I’m happy to help. And you’ve been very brave, facing these fears and asking these important questions. Hello?
PATIENT: .
