DOCTOR: Right. Ellan Ranells, 74. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Batara, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it. Says it’s good for… things. I’m not one to just jump on bandwagons, you understand. But she’s insistent. I thought I'd just see if I could even get a… a permission slip, if you will, to look into it. It’s not like I’m some… needing it, but one never knows, does one?
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana. Yes. A… permission slip. I see. Well, frankly, it’s become quite the… trend, hasn’t it?
PATIENT: Precisely! A trend. Exactly. And I do try to avoid being… fashionable, if you catch my drift. Though my daughter… she thinks everything new is the best. It’s exhausting. But, she mentioned something about needing a doctor to… sign off on it. Is that what this visit is for? Just the signing, really. I'm not here complaining of aches and pains, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: So, you want me to essentially rubber-stamp something based on your daughter’s… enthusiasm?
PATIENT: Oh, now, don’t put it quite like that! It’s not just enthusiasm, Doctor. She does her research, bless her. It's more… due diligence, wouldn’t you say? She read something about it helping with… well, I can't quite recall what specifically. Something about sleep, perhaps? Or nerves? It's just… it seems a lot of people are using it, and I thought, well, why not inquire? I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of managing my own life, but I don’t like to be left behind, if you understand. It’s simply about having the option, Doctor. That’s all.
DOCTOR: “Having the option.” Right. Well, just to be clear, I don’t simply hand out “options” based on hearsay and… parental pressure. There are specific medical conditions for which medical marijuana might be considered. Sleep disturbances and “nerves” are… broad terms. Now, let’s go through a proper review. Have you been diagnosed with anything specifically, like insomnia, anxiety, or another condition?
PATIENT: Well, diagnosed... that's a strong word, Doctor. I wouldn't say diagnosed. I sleep… adequately. Though not as soundly as I used to, of course. One doesn't sleep like a baby at my age, naturally. And nerves… well, who doesn't have nerves these days? The world is a stressful place! My husband, bless his soul, he passed away three years ago. That was… unsettling. It’s not as if I’m constantly beside myself, but… grief, you understand. It lingers. Is that what you mean by a “condition”? Just… normal life, Doctor. Perhaps a bit sad at times, but normal.
DOCTOR: “Normal life.” Right. Grief is… certainly a factor. But grief, while profoundly difficult, isn’t automatically a medical condition requiring medication. And simply not sleeping “as soundly as you used to” doesn’t meet the criteria for a medical marijuana prescription. It sounds like you're experiencing expected challenges following a significant loss, and that’s… understandable. Have you considered grief counseling or support groups?
PATIENT: Counseling? Oh, no. Absolutely not. I don't air my laundry in public, Doctor. And support groups... the very idea! Sitting around with a bunch of… others sharing their woes? Heavens, no. I have my daughter, and she’s quite capable, thank you very much. And I manage. I always have. I simply thought… well, I thought this marijuana might be a… a little something extra. A boost, if you will. Not some… desperate attempt to fix anything. Just… a pleasant evening, perhaps? Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: A “pleasant evening” is not a medical indication, Mrs. Ranells. I understand you don’t want to “air your laundry,” but a proper assessment requires honesty. You are asking me to essentially endorse a substance for recreational use under the guise of a medical need. I am not comfortable doing that. There are potential risks and side effects, even with medical marijuana, and without a legitimate medical condition, it is simply… irresponsible.
PATIENT: Recreational use? Are you implying I am… frivolous? I assure you, Doctor, I am a woman of considerable dignity! I came here seeking information, and now you are accusing me of… what exactly? My daughter suggested it, yes, but I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions. And I would hardly call wanting a little peace of mind “frivolous”. Perhaps I came to the wrong doctor. One who is more… open-minded. You seem determined to find fault with everything I say. It’s quite… unpleasant, actually. I think I've wasted enough of my time here. .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Ranells, I am not accusing you of anything. I am practicing responsible medicine. And frankly, it seems clear that you are not seeking medical treatment; you are seeking a prescription to validate a personal choice. I wish you well, but I cannot fulfill your request. Perhaps a second opinion would be beneficial. But I will not be complicit in endorsing a substance without a legitimate medical need. Good day.
