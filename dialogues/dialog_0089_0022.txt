DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It just doesn’t feel right. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “big” and not feeling hungry. I understand things are a little hazy with remembering dates, that’s perfectly alright. Let's try to piece things together. When you say “big”, can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… like I swallowed a watermelon, maybe? Not painful, exactly, just… full. And heavy. Like I’m carrying something extra. It's just… uncomfortable. I used to be smaller, you know? I don’t think I’ve gained weight… have I? It’s hard to tell these days. I mostly just eat soup, when I eat at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fullness like you swallowed a watermelon, not painful, just uncomfortable and heavy. And you're mostly eating soup. I see. Let me just pull up your records here… Alright, Soila McConnon, age 90. Height 154 cm, weight 106 pounds. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – more frequent, less frequent, or any changes in the stool itself?
PATIENT: Oh dear… bowel… what now? You mean… going to the bathroom? It's… normal, I think. Maybe a little less than usual. Everything feels slow, you know? Like an old clock… ticking very, very slowly. I don’t really pay attention to it, if that makes sense. Old lady problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, “slower” than usual is good to know. And you're right, it's helpful to know if things are moving a little slower. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your appetite besides just not feeling hungry?
PATIENT: Nausea… like wanting to… throw up? No, no, not really. I haven't thrown up. Just… don't feel like eating. Everything smells… strong, sometimes. Even soup. It’s funny, isn’t it? I like soup! But it doesn't tempt me like it used to. My stomach just feels… blah. Is that a word? "Blah?"
DOCTOR: “Blah” is a perfectly good word, Soila. It describes it well! Alright, no nausea or vomiting, just a loss of appetite and things smelling stronger. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. I… don’t know. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. My clothes… maybe a little looser? But I’ve always been small. I don’t really weigh myself anymore. It used to upset me, you know? Numbers… they aren’t always kind. I just feel… weaker, maybe? But that could be just getting old. Everything aches, Doctor. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, clothes a little looser, feeling weaker, and aches all over. That helps me get a better picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just listen to your tummy, feel around a little, and check your overall condition. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust you. Just be gentle, please. Everything is… fragile these days. Like an old teacup. You don’t want to break it.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Okay, I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, although they are a little quiet. Now, I'm going to gently press on your tummy to feel for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, no pain there. Just… feels a little full. Like a balloon. Not bad pain, just… aware of it. Everything feels… stretched, I think. Like it’s been filled with air. But it’s not hurting, really. Just… odd. You're being very gentle, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m noticing some mild fullness, as you described, and it doesn't seem to be causing you any sharp pain. No obvious masses that I can feel. Now I'm going to listen to your lungs, just to make sure everything sounds clear. Take a deep breath for me, Soila. Sounds clear on both sides. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6. Okay, everything seems stable, but the fullness in your abdomen and loss of appetite are concerning. Given your age and the changes you’ve described, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better understanding of what's going on. We'll also need to do a stool test to rule out any infections.
PATIENT: Oh my… a lot of tests. Is it something serious, Doctor? I don’t want to cause you too much trouble. I just thought it was old age catching up with me. All those tests… will they hurt? And what do they… look for, exactly? I don't understand all the medical words.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. It’s standard procedure to investigate when there are changes like these, and we're just trying to be thorough. The tests aren't painful. The blood test will just be a small prick of a needle, and the stool test will involve collecting a small sample. The blood test will look at your overall health, check for anemia and infection, and see how your kidneys and liver are functioning. The stool test checks for any bacteria or parasites that might be causing your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, it just helps us to rule things out. Given your symptoms and age, we need to consider possibilities like diverticulitis, constipation, or even something more serious like a bowel obstruction. These tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and ensure you get the right care. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear… allergies… let me think. I don't think so. I haven't taken much medicine in years. Maybe a little aspirin sometimes, for my aches. But nothing regular. I don’t really remember having a bad reaction to anything… but my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? Diver-what-now? And a bowel… obstruction? That sounds… scary. I just want to feel better, Doctor. I miss eating my soup.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried when you hear those terms. Diverticulitis is an inflammation of small pouches in the colon, and a bowel obstruction means something is blocking your intestines. But again, we don’t know if that’s what’s happening yet, these are just possibilities we need to rule out. No known allergies, occasional aspirin. Okay. The lab can draw your blood now, and they’ll give you a container for the stool sample. I’ll explain the collection process, it’s quite simple. Here's a pamphlet with instructions. It explains everything clearly. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Do you have any questions right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that pamphlet looks helpful. Stool… sample… right. It’s a little embarrassing, isn’t it? But if it helps… I suppose I can manage. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? And will it hurt? I don't want to be waiting for weeks, worrying.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed, Soila, but it’s a very common test and the lab technicians are very professional. It shouldn’t take more than a few days to get the results back – usually around 2-3 business days. And no, it won't hurt at all. The only discomfort might be the slight inconvenience of collecting the sample. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you try to stay hydrated – drink plenty of fluids. And if you start experiencing any severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or constipation, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a mild stool softener to help things along. And remember, I’m here to answer any questions you have, so please don’t hesitate to call. Do you have someone who can help you get to the lab and pick up the results?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know about the stool softener. Thank you, Doctor. I think my neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, could help me. She’s a very kind woman. She drives, you see. And she always asks after me. It's just… getting old is so tiring. Everything feels like such an effort. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I think… I think that's all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. It’s my job to help, and you’re not alone in this. Getting older is tiring, and it’s perfectly alright to need a little extra help. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any more questions, no matter how small. Here’s the prescription, and the lab information is on this slip. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Thank you again. I think I'll just go home and rest now. And try to drink some water. And maybe… maybe some soup. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. Get some rest, and enjoy your soup. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Take care.
