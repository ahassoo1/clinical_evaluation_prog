DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I think. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, I have been noticing things. Things with my memory. It is… troubling, and my blood pressure has been… not good. I want to find out what is happening. I do hope this will not take too long.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. Memory concerns and blood pressure issues are definitely worth investigating. We’ll take things at a comfortable pace, and I’ll do my best to address all of your concerns. To start with the memory issues, could you tell me a bit more about what you’ve been noticing?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is… difficult to explain. It is not that I forget everything. No. I remember dates, names… very specific things, actually. It is more… like a fog. Sometimes I will go to put something away, and… the reason I was putting it away is gone. Or I will be speaking, and the word… the correct word… escapes me. It is frustrating. And it is… newer. This has been happening more these last few months. My husband… he would always remind me of things. It is… different now.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s not a global memory loss, but rather difficulty recalling recent events or finding the right words?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Recent… things. And the words. It is like they are on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot… grasp them. It is a very unpleasant feeling. I used to be very articulate. I managed many properties, you see. Lots of meetings, reports… I needed to remember details, negotiate… it is worrisome that this is happening. I hope it is not… something serious.
DOCTOR: That certainly sounds concerning, Ms. Alvara, and it's understandable that you're worried. It’s good you’re addressing this now. Given your history of managing properties and needing to be articulate, a change in your cognitive function is certainly worth investigating. Let's move on to your blood pressure. Do you know what your readings have been recently?
PATIENT: Yes. My… friend, she is a nurse, she checks it sometimes. Last time, it was… 160 over 95, I believe. She says it is too high. I do not always feel unwell, but I get… headaches. And sometimes my vision… it blurs a little. Is that… connected, do you think? To the memory? My friend says high blood pressure can cause problems, but I do not know which problems.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95 is elevated, Ms. Alvara, and your friend is right to be concerned. High blood pressure can absolutely affect cognitive function, as well as cause headaches and blurry vision, as you've experienced. It’s quite possible your blood pressure and memory concerns are related. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask you a bit more about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: No. Not before. It was… a surprise, really. I have always been… healthy. I eat well, I walk… not as much as I should, perhaps. But no diagnosed conditions. My husband… he had heart problems. But I… I have always been… robust. This blood pressure, it only began about six months ago, maybe? Around the time… around the time of his passing, actually. It has been… difficult, adjusting.
DOCTOR: I see. And I am very sorry to hear about your husband's passing, Ms. Alvara. Significant life events like that can certainly impact your health. Okay. To clarify, you said this started about six months ago, coinciding with your husband’s passing. Have you noticed any other changes in your health besides the blood pressure and memory issues?
PATIENT: Yes. Well… I sleep poorly. I wake often, and I do not feel rested. And… I have been more… irritable, I think. Not with people, necessarily, but just… easily frustrated. Small things bother me. And… my appetite has been less. I used to enjoy cooking, very much. But now… it is a chore. I am trying to eat, but… it is not the same. Is that… important, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all important things to note, Ms. Alvara. Changes in sleep, mood, and appetite can all be related to both high blood pressure and cognitive changes, especially given the stressful circumstances you’ve been through. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I do not like taking pills. My husband… he had so many medications. I always said I would not. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but… that is all. I have not taken anything for my blood pressure yet. My friend said I should see a doctor first. Which… is why I am here. Is that… foolish, do you think? Waiting this long?
DOCTOR: No, not at all foolish, Ms. Alvara. It’s very wise to seek medical advice before starting any treatment, and you were right to wait to see a doctor. It's good you're being cautious. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I have never had a reaction to anything. I eat… most things. I used to enjoy shellfish, but… I have not eaten much of anything lately. Not because of allergies, but… lack of appetite, you see. I do not recall ever being allergic to anything in my life. Is that all, do you think? Perhaps we can discuss… a plan? To address these things?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We've covered a lot of important ground. To move forward, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. I also want to perform a short cognitive assessment to get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds sensible. A physical exam… and the assessment. I suppose it is necessary. I do hope it will not take too long. I have some… property matters to attend to this afternoon. But yes, please. Proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… want to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I will be as efficient as possible. It shouldn’t take long. Please, if you could just follow me this way to the examination room. First, I’m going to check your vital signs. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes. Of course. I do hope it is not too high. My friend says… worry makes it worse. I try to be calm, but… it is difficult. This whole situation… is rather unsettling. But yes. Proceed. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm and try to breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 168 over 92. A little elevated, as your friend noted. Your pulse is 78, which is within a normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Everything sounds good so far, physically. Now, let's move on to the cognitive assessment. This will involve a few simple questions and tasks to assess your memory and thinking skills. It shouldn’t be anything to worry about, just a quick check. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes. I am ready. As long as it is… quick. I do not enjoy tests, you see. But I understand it is necessary. Proceed. I shall do my best. Although, I must warn you, my memory… is not what it once was. But I shall try.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. We’re not looking for perfection, just a baseline. Okay, first, could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… It is… August 2nd. The year is… 2025. Yes. August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I hope I remembered correctly. It is… disconcerting how easily these things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: That is correct. Very good. Now, I’m going to name three objects. I want you to repeat them back to me, and then I’ll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes. Ready. Please proceed. I shall try my best to remember. Three objects… it should not be too difficult. But… my mind feels… foggy. Proceed. Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three objects are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I believe that is correct. Now, what comes next? I trust you will remind me soon, before I forget. It is… unsettling, this feeling. The words… are still there, but… tenuous.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Ms. Alvara. You remembered them perfectly. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of simple questions. Please just answer to the best of your ability. First question: What city are we in currently?
PATIENT: What city… Hmm. I… I believe it is a suburban area. I do not recall the specific name of the city. I traveled here with my friend. It is… quite close to… oh dear. The name escapes me. I do not recognize the surroundings. Is that… bad? I am so sorry. I should know this.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. It's not a problem at all. Sometimes it's difficult to remember details when you're in a new place. We can revisit it later if you prefer. Now, let’s try a different question. Can you tell me your husband’s name?
PATIENT: My husband… His name was… Dimitri. Dimitri Alvara. We were married for… many years. A very long time. I remember his name… of course I remember his name. He was… a good man. It pains me to speak of him, still. But yes. Dimitri. Dimitri Alvara. I hope I am not… upsetting you with this. It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: You're not upsetting me at all, Ms. Alvara. It's perfectly natural to feel emotional when you talk about your husband. And you remembered his name perfectly. Now, one last quick test. I will give you three unrelated words, and I would like you to recall them after a short delay. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes. Ready. Please proceed. I shall try my best, although I have a feeling… this will not go well. Three words… Very well. Let us proceed. Quickly, if you please. I have some… pressing matters to attend to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: book, chair, tree. I will ask you to repeat them back to me in about five minutes. Let's move on to discussing your past medical history for now, while you try to remember those words. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No. None. As I said before, I have always been… healthy. I do not have diabetes, or heart disease. My joints ache sometimes, but I attributed that to… age. Nothing a doctor has ever diagnosed. I have always been very… robust. I eat well, I walk… although perhaps not enough, now. But I have never been seriously ill. Never. But… those words… I cannot recall them. I am so sorry. It is… dreadful. Are you certain this is… helpful? Perhaps we should simply… discuss treatment?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. It’s not a test, just an assessment to get a better understanding of your cognitive function. And it’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things, especially with everything you're going through. Now, let's talk about your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have never had a surgery. Not a single one. I have always been… fortunate in that regard. I avoid hospitals whenever possible. I find them… unsettling. So no, I have never been operated on. Not once. But those words… they are gone. Completely gone. It is… frightening, Doctor. Truly frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. It’s alright. We have enough information for now. It seems you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, including recent memory loss and difficulty recalling words. Given your recent blood pressure readings and these cognitive concerns, I would like to discuss a plan of action. First, we need to address your high blood pressure. I recommend we start you on a low dose of an antihypertensive medication, and monitor your blood pressure regularly. We can adjust the dosage as needed to get it under control. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds sensible. Medication for the blood pressure. I suppose it is necessary. As long as it is a low dose. I do not like taking pills, you see. But if it will help… then yes. Proceed. But please, keep the dosage as low as possible. But will the medication… help with the memory? Is there anything… anything at all… that can be done to improve my recall? It is the memory that troubles me the most, Doctor. More than the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Alvara. Addressing your high blood pressure may certainly help improve your cognitive function, as uncontrolled high blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the brain. However, we need to investigate further to determine the underlying cause of your memory difficulties. I recommend we schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I also want to order a comprehensive blood panel to check for any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory loss. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests… An MRI sounds… unpleasant. And blood tests… I dislike needles. But if it is necessary… if it will help determine the cause… then yes. I suppose I must agree. But please, Doctor, let me know if there is anything… anything at all… I can do to prepare. And… will the results be… alarming? I am worried, you see. Very worried. It is… difficult, facing this uncertainty. But yes. Proceed. If you believe it is necessary. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Alvara. The MRI is non-invasive, although it does require you to lie still inside a scanner for about 30-45 minutes. We’ll provide you with earplugs and headphones to minimize the noise. The blood tests will be a routine draw, and the phlebotomist will be very gentle. I want to be honest with you. The results of the tests could help us identify the underlying cause of your memory loss, which could range from something relatively minor like a vitamin deficiency to something more serious. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. We need to wait for the results and discuss them thoroughly. For now, let’s focus on getting your blood pressure under control. I’m going to prescribe you Lisinopril 10mg once daily. Please start taking it tomorrow morning. I also want you to monitor your blood pressure at home twice a day and keep a log of your readings. Would you like me to provide you with instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Instructions on how to monitor my blood pressure at home. And… what if the readings are high? What should I do? I do not want to… overreact. I just want to… understand. And… is there anything… anything at all… I can do to improve my memory now? While we wait for the tests? Any exercises? Any vitamins? Any… tricks? I just want to… cling to something. This is… unsettling. Very unsettling. Please, Doctor. Tell me there is something I can do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. Here are the instructions for monitoring your blood pressure at home. It's important to use a properly fitted cuff and follow the instructions carefully. If your readings are consistently above 140/90, please call my office to schedule an appointment. Now, regarding improving your memory, there are several things you can try. While they may not be a cure, they can help stimulate your brain and potentially improve your cognitive function. First, regular mental exercise is crucial. This could include activities like crossword puzzles, Sudoku, reading, or learning a new skill. Second, a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids is important. Third, regular physical exercise can also improve blood flow to the brain. Regarding vitamins, there is some evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency can contribute to memory loss, so I recommend getting your vitamin B12 levels checked. I'll include that in the blood panel. You can also consider taking a multivitamin with vitamin B12. Finally, staying socially active and maintaining strong relationships can also help improve cognitive function. We're going to work through this together, Ms. Alvara. It's important to stay positive and focus on what you can do to improve your health. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. It is… a lot to take in. Medication… MRI… blood tests… vitamins… exercises… But thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And thank you for being… gentle. I just want to… understand what is happening. I believe that is all for now. Perhaps… perhaps I should schedule the MRI soon? Before I forget. I have a feeling… I would forget. Yes. Please. Schedule the MRI. As soon as possible. I just want to… know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I’m scheduling the MRI for you now. It’s scheduled for August 9th at 10:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. They will call you to confirm the appointment and provide instructions on how to prepare. Here's the confirmation slip with all the details. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the MRI results and blood panel. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I believe that is all. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. You have been… most helpful. I just hope… I hope everything will be alright. Thank you again. And… good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I hope everything goes well with the MRI. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well, and please take care. .
