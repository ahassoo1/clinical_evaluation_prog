DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Lovely to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me see… My… my son, bless him, he said I should come. Something about needing to know… my blood type? Yes, that’s right. Something about it being good to know, just in case. I don't quite remember why, myself. Old age, you know. It slips the mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's always a good idea to have that information, and your son is very thoughtful to encourage you to come in. Knowing your blood type can be important in various situations, as he mentioned. So, just to clarify – is this the only reason for your visit today, or are you experiencing any other health concerns – perhaps any new symptoms or anything that’s been bothering you recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing else really. Just the blood type thing. I feel… well, I feel my age, naturally! A little creaky, maybe, but nothing that a good lie-down doesn't fix. No new aches or pains, not that I can recall. Everything's been… pretty normal, all things considered. Though, I did trip over the cat last week… but that wasn't exactly a health concern, was it?
DOCTOR: No, tripping over the cat doesn’t sound like a medical emergency! It’s good to hear that you’re generally feeling well, and that any discomfort is just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Let’s go ahead and get that blood type checked for you, then. While we're at it, would you mind if I ask a few routine questions about your medical history, just to have a complete picture?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, dear. Ask away. I’ll try my best to remember. It’s been… a long life, you know? Lots of things happen. I might need a little prompting now and then, if that’s alright. What sort of questions are we talking about? I used to be quite the rigger, you know. Strong as an ox, I was! Though, that was… goodness, decades ago now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, take your time. And don't worry about remembering everything – I’m happy to help prompt you. It's wonderful that you were a rigger – that sounds physically demanding! Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Heart problems… I don’t think so. The doctor did tell me once my blood pressure was a little high, ages ago, when my husband was still… well, never mind that now. He gave me some pills, I think. I took them for a while, but honestly, I can’t recall if I finished the course. Everything’s a bit of a blur. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I always loved a good pastry, but I wasn't ever told I had that problem. I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder at work, but that was just a break, wasn’t it? Not a condition.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you were briefly treated for high blood pressure, which is good to know. And yes, a broken arm is an injury, not a long-term condition. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh dear. Let me think. My appendix, I believe. When I was quite young, still a girl. And… and I think my gallbladder, many years later. But honestly, it’s all so long ago. I remember being very sick afterwards, but not much else. I don’t recall any other surgeries. My husband always took care of the paperwork, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, appendix and gallbladder surgeries. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh my. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived to a good age, I think. Though, I don't really recall what age. She had… she had a weak heart, I believe. My father… he passed away when I was young, from… something. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. And I had a brother and sister, but they both… they both moved away, a long time ago. I haven't seen them in… decades.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for memories to fade over time. So, it sounds like your mother had a weak heart. Knowing that is helpful. Now, let's talk about any medications you are currently taking, or have taken recently. Do you take any pills, creams, or liquids on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Right now? Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up. A small white pill. I don't recall the name, though. The pharmacist handles that. And… and I used to take something for my blood pressure, like I said, but I stopped taking that ages ago. I don’t think I’m on anything else regularly. I have some cream for my hands, they get so dry, but that’s not a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Just the arthritis medication as needed. And yes, the hand cream doesn't count as a medication. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything. I loved shellfish, even. Never had any trouble. And no reactions to any medicines, as far as I can remember. I did get stung by a bee once, when I was a little girl, but that wasn’t an allergy, was it? Just a painful sting!
DOCTOR: No, a bee sting isn’t an allergy. It sounds like you don’t have any known allergies, which is excellent. Now, to complete the picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you need. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. My bones are old, but they're sturdy! Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Deep breath… and out… Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/92. That's not drastically high, but it is something we should keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear, and your throat is a little dry, but nothing concerning. Finally, I’m going to check your pulse and reflexes. Your pulse is good and strong, and your reflexes are a little slow, but that’s not uncommon with age. Everything seems generally good, Ms. Nini, but the elevated blood pressure is something we should discuss.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? I suppose I shouldn't have had that extra pastry with my coffee this morning… Everything feels a little… fuzzy lately. Is it something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? Perhaps my son was right to bring me in…
DOCTOR: It's good that we're checking it now, and it’s not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm. Elevated blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is quite common, especially as we get older. It’s often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. It's good your son encouraged you to come in – preventative care is always a good idea. The good news is, your heart sounds strong, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are a little slow, which is perfectly normal for someone your age. To get a better understanding of your overall health and the cause of the elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some routine blood tests. This will help us rule out any other potential issues and see if there are any underlying factors contributing to the high blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? Well, alright, dear. If that’s what you think is best. I don’t love needles, but I’ll do what I need to. I’ve had my share of scrapes and bruises in my life, a little prick won’t bother me too much. Will it be very painful? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? I have a bridge game on Thursday…
DOCTOR: It won’t be very painful at all, Ms. Nini. Just a quick little prick. The phlebotomist is very good, and it will be over before you know it. The results usually take about 2-3 business days. So, you should have them back well before your bridge game on Thursday. While we are waiting for the results, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. These include reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Oh, those all sound… sensible, dear. Salt, fruits, exercise… I suppose I could try. I do love my little treats, though! And getting exercise… my bones aren't what they used to be. But I'll try. I really will. My son would be pleased. Perhaps a little walk in the park each day? And I suppose I could lay off the pastries… a little. Is there anything else I should be doing? And… who will explain the results when they come back?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Nini. A little walk each day is a perfect start. Even 15-20 minutes can make a difference. And reducing your pastry intake a little is a great goal. Small changes can add up to big improvements. As for other things, try to get 7-8 hours of sleep each night, and avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. But most importantly, manage stress. Find activities you enjoy to relax and unwind. I will personally explain the results to you when they come back. I’ll call you with the results, or we can schedule a follow-up appointment, whichever you prefer. Now, I'm going to write you a requisition for the blood tests and give you a handout with information on lifestyle changes for managing high blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Let me see… managing stress… Easier said than done, dear! But I’ll try. Hmm. I think that covers everything, for now. Oh! Just one thing. Do I need to fast before the blood tests? My son said something about that… I always forget these things!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question! Yes, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. It's important for accurate results. Your son is right to remind you – it’s a common requirement. Is there anything else I can clarify for you before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know. 8-12 hours… I can manage that. I usually have a late dinner, so that should be fine. No, I think that’s all, dear. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing what’s going on, and I’ll do my best to follow your instructions. Perhaps I will lay off the pastries… a little. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nini. I’m glad I could help. And remember, small steps can make a big difference. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your bridge game on Thursday! It was lovely meeting you.
