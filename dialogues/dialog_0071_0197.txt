DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Please, have a seat. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. It’s… well, I need a card to drive for those ride-share companies. You know, like Uber and Lyft. And maybe taxis too, if that’s different. I think it’s called a Commercial Driver Medical Card? I want to get it done quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, a Commercial Driver Medical Card, exactly. It can be a bit involved, but we’ll do our best to get through it efficiently. It sounds like you’re looking for a DOT physical. Just to be clear, are you currently driving for any of these companies, or are you hoping to start?
PATIENT: Hoping to start. I just got divorced, and… well, I need something to do, and the money would be helpful. I haven’t driven for them yet, no. I figured I needed to get this card first, before I even apply. Does that make sense? I don’t want to get ahead of myself.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible, San. Absolutely right to get the medical card sorted first. It’s always best to be prepared. Okay. So, this will involve a thorough physical exam and a review of your medical history. We'll need to cover a fair bit of ground, just to make sure everything’s in order. First, let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let’s see… high blood pressure, yes, for a while. But the doctor put me on something, and it’s been… well, controlled, I think. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since… since things with my husband got bad. About two years, maybe? It’s been good, though, really. No problems. I had a gallbladder removed, oh, maybe fifteen years ago? And… hmm. I think that’s it. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication – good. Gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. And childhood illnesses. We'll need to get the specifics of the medication you're on for your blood pressure, if you have a list or remember the name. And just to confirm, about two years since your last general check-up?
PATIENT: Yes, about two years. The name of the medicine… hold on. …Here! It’s Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I have it right here, see? I keep a few extra days with me, just in case. I am very careful with it.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Lisinopril 10mg daily. That's helpful. And you said it’s been well-controlled?
PATIENT: Yes. My blood pressure used to be very high, I could feel it. But since I started the Lisinopril, it’s… normal, I think. I haven’t had any dizzy spells or headaches or anything like that. I check it occasionally at the drugstore, and it’s usually around 120 over 80, something like that. Not perfect, maybe, but much better than it was.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, San. And no other medical problems, no chest pain, shortness of breath, or any recent hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. I walk every day, about thirty minutes, rain or shine. Keeps me moving. And no hospitalizations… not since the gallbladder, and that was ages ago. I’m pretty healthy, really, for my age. I just want to get this card so I can start driving. It's been… difficult, lately, you know? But I don't want to bother you with that.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, San. And it sounds like you’re doing a very good job of taking care of yourself, walking thirty minutes a day is excellent. Okay, just a few more questions about your history, then we’ll move on to a quick physical exam. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of. I eat everything, I’ve never had a reaction to anything. And I can take any medicine without a problem. I’ve always been lucky that way. My husband, on the other hand… he was allergic to everything! But not me. I’m pretty tough, really. I’ve always been able to handle things.
DOCTOR: Good to know, no known allergies. And just one last thing, before the exam. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements, besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Just a multivitamin, every morning with breakfast. And sometimes, if my knees are bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. But not every day, just when I need it. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. Just the Lisinopril and the occasional ibuprofen and multivitamin. Is that all you need to know? I’m ready for the exam, if you are.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, San. Thank you. Okay, let’s move on to the physical exam. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also check your vision and reflexes, and a general neurological exam. Could you please sit up straight on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m a bit… rusty, maybe, it’s been a while since I’ve been to the doctor. But I’ll cooperate, I promise. Just let me know if anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, San. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82, and your pulse is 72, regular. Not bad at all. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your vision. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… E… F… P… T… 20/30… is that good? I always had trouble seeing things far away, even when I was young. I don’t wear glasses, though. I get by. Is that bad? I can see things up close perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: 20/30 vision, a slight correction needed but not necessarily requiring glasses for daily activities. Okay. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees and elbows with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. Okay, reflexes are normal. Everything seems good so far. Now, just a quick neurological exam... Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? I'm trying to keep my head still. It’s a little difficult, my neck gets stiff sometimes. But I’m following it, are you happy? Is that good? My eyes are a bit tired, maybe. I was up late reading last night. A mystery novel, very good one.
DOCTOR: Yes, very good, San. Eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Everything seems normal. Okay, last thing. I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Everything seems normal, San. Alright. Based on the physical exam, everything appears to be within normal limits. However, to be absolutely certain, and in accordance with DOT regulations, I'd like to order a urine test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. A urine test, no problem. I haven’t had one in… well, a long time. But I’ll do it, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to get this card, so I can start driving. Is it a difficult test? Do I need to… prepare in any way? I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a book I want to finish.
DOCTOR: It's a very straightforward test, San. Nothing to worry about. You'll just need to provide a sample. It's mainly to check for things like protein, sugar, and infection. We have a private restroom right down the hall. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. It shouldn't take too long at all. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and proceed with the DOT certification if everything is normal. Do you have any questions about the test or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Just… give me a minute, and I’ll go do it. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, after so long. But I’ll manage. Thank you for being so… kind. I appreciate it. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: So far so good… slightly impaired vision, managed hypertension… needs to be documented carefully. Hopefully, the urine test comes back clear. She seems very motivated to get this done. It’s good to see. .
PATIENT: .
