DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Heindel. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi Doctor. Thanks. Just... curiosity, mostly. I ain't really sick sick. Just figured I should, ya know, check things out. Been workin' on the boats a while now, and figured it couldn't hurt.
DOCTOR: "Curiosity," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like, make sure everything's still workin' good, ya know? Long days, heavy work… lots of sun. Ain't had a check-up in… well, a long time. Before the divorce, maybe. I just wanna be sure I'm okay, for the future.
DOCTOR: Well, preventative care is… admirable, I suppose. Though usually people come when something is wrong. Still. Alright. Let’s start with a basic history. You said you’ve been working on boats for a while… what kind of work exactly?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get that. Probably shoulda come sooner. Mostly I'm a marine oiler. Keep the engines runnin' smooth, ya know? Grease stuff, check the fluids, that kinda thing. Sometimes I help with the sails too, when they need an extra hand. It's hard work, but it pays the bills. Been doin' it since I was… eighteen, I think. Something like that. Lots of time out on the water.
DOCTOR: Alright. Marine oiler. That does involve physical labor, certainly. Any specific injuries or issues you’ve had from the work?
PATIENT: Hmm… Nah, nothin' major. Plenty of scrapes and bruises, ya know? Tripped over ropes, bumped into things... usual boat stuff. My back gets a little sore sometimes, after a long shift. And my hands… they get kinda rough and cracked from the salt water and grease. But nothin' I couldn’t work through, usually. See? Not too bad.
DOCTOR: "Not too bad" isn’t exactly a medical assessment, Mr. Heindel. Alright. We'll get to a physical exam in a moment. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… no, not really. Not that I know of, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but that healed up fine. And I had the usual childhood stuff, ya know? Chickenpox, measles… but nothin' serious. Never been told I had anything wrong with me, nothin' like that. My ex-wife always took care of the doctor stuff when we were together. I just… went along with it. I didn't really pay attention.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Always been pretty lucky, I guess. Scrapes and bruises, yeah, but nothin’ that needed cuttin’ or stitchin’. Never even broken a bone as an adult. Still got all my parts, workin’ order, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family?
PATIENT: My family… Uh, my mom passed away a few years back. She was okay, always a bit worried. My dad, he’s still around, lives down south. Haven’t seen him in a while, things got… complicated. He had high blood pressure, I think, but other than that, they were both pretty healthy. Not a lot of family history of serious illness, as far as I know. Mostly just… regular old people stuff. Ya know?
DOCTOR: And what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Uh… well, I don’t really have a lot of social life, to be honest. Work takes up most of my time. When I ain’t workin’, I mostly just… relax. Watch TV, read a book. Sometimes I go fishin’. I don’t really go out to bars or nothin’. I used to drink a bit more when I was married, but I cut back a lot since the divorce. Mostly just a beer or two now and then, if I'm with a friend. Don't smoke. Never have. Pretty boring life, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I don't like takin' pills, if I can avoid it. I'll try to tough things out, ya know? If I got a headache, I'll drink some water. If my back's sore, I'll stretch it out. I don't really believe in relyin' on medicine unless I absolutely have to. Old-fashioned, maybe. But it's worked for me so far.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's proceed with a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Always figured I was lookin’ kinda rough, but I guess a doctor’s gotta have a look. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please breathe deeply through your mouth. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay, breathin' deep... No problem. Everything feels… normal, I guess. Just the usual boat life aches and pains. Go ahead. Let me know if you feel anything weird. It's probably just gas, though. I eat a lot of beans.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses palpated. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Any history of numbness or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: Okay, tappin’ the knees… Feels kinda funny. Nope. No numbness or tinglin’. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My feet get a little cold sometimes, workin’ on the boats, but that’s about it. Nothin’ weird, I promise. Everything’s workin’ pretty good, for an old sailor.
DOCTOR: Ears are clear bilaterally, tympanic membranes are intact. Alright. Based on the physical exam, everything appears within normal limits. However, given your history of long-term physical labor and sun exposure, I recommend a few baseline tests. We should check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also recommend a skin check with a dermatologist. Prolonged sun exposure increases your risk of skin cancer.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Cholesterol, blood sugar, kidneys… gotta check those things. Skin check too, you’re right. I been out on the water a lot of years. Never really thought about skin cancer, to be honest. So, what do we gotta do? Blood test? Seein’ another doctor? Just let me know what I need to do. I appreciate you lookin’ everything over. It’s good to know I ain’t fallin’ apart just yet.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll order a complete blood panel, including a lipid profile and comprehensive metabolic panel. I’ll also send a referral to a dermatologist for a full skin examination. The lab is just down the hall; you can go there at your convenience. They'll need a requisition form, which the nurse will provide. As for the dermatologist, they will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I also recommend increasing your water intake and wearing protective clothing and sunscreen when you’re outdoors. It’s good practice, even if you don’t feel like it. And please, schedule a follow-up appointment with me in three months to review the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, got it. Blood test, dermatologist, drink more water, wear sunscreen… sounds like a plan. Three months, follow-up. I can remember that. Uh… no, I think that covers it. Maybe just… what kinda sunscreen should I be lookin’ for? Is there a specific number or somethin’? I ain’t really paid attention to that kinda stuff before.
DOCTOR: You want a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Broad-spectrum means it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. And reapply it every two hours, or more frequently if you're swimming or sweating. There are plenty of options available at any drugstore. Look for one that's water-resistant, too. And don't forget to apply it to your ears, neck, and the back of your hands. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: SPF 30, broad-spectrum, reapply every two hours… got it. Water-resistant, ears and neck… okay. I can handle that. Nah, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate you takin’ the time to look me over, Doctor. And explainin’ everything so clearly. It’s good to know what I need to do to stay healthy. I’ll go get the blood test done and schedule that dermatologist appointment. Thanks again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well, Mr. Heindel. .
PATIENT: .
