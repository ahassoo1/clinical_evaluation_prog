DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's lovely to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won't stop. Been going on for… goodness, I'd say almost a full day now. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, especially for a woman my age!
DOCTOR: I understand. A full day of hiccups is quite bothersome, and I can certainly appreciate it being a little embarrassing. Let's try to figure out what's going on. Could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, they come and go, mostly after I eat, or sometimes just… randomly. There doesn't seem to be a pattern, not really. And they’re not painful, exactly, just… startling! And a bit tiring, if I'm honest. I've tried holding my breath, like my grandmother used to tell me, and drinking water really fast, but nothing seems to do the trick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they’re associated with eating sometimes, but also happen randomly. And you've already tried some common remedies – holding your breath and drinking water quickly. Good to know. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe what you’ve been eating over the last 24 hours or so?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Yesterday for breakfast, I had a little bit of papaya and toast with a smear of jam. Lunch was a tuna sandwich – white bread, I'm afraid, I should really switch to whole wheat – and a small salad. Dinner was… oh dear, it was a bit of a feast, actually. My daughter came over, so we had roast chicken with potatoes and vegetables. And a tiny bit of chocolate cake for dessert. Perhaps the chocolate cake is the culprit?
DOCTOR: It’s possible the chocolate cake played a role, though sometimes hiccups can be a bit mysterious. We'll investigate. Now, apart from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… No, not really. No heartburn, no indigestion… I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that. My stomach feels perfectly normal, apart from the hiccuping, of course! I’ve been sleeping alright, and my appetite is fine – well, maybe too fine, if you count that chocolate cake! It’s just the hiccups are… distracting, you know? And a little worrisome when they go on for so long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Distracting and worrisome are fair feelings when something persists for a full day. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… Years ago, I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that hasn't bothered me since. Apart from that, nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older! I’m generally a very healthy woman, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the history of hypertension, well-controlled on medication, and the cholecystectomy twenty years ago. That’s helpful. And I appreciate you mentioning you generally feel healthy – that's important information. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for the blood pressure. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take a little bit of ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. I always take it with food, of course. Is that something I should be worried about? The ibuprofen, I mean?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. The Lisinopril is listed here, and occasional ibuprofen use shouldn’t be a problem, as long as you’re taking it with food, which you are. We will keep that in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine, as far as I can remember. I'm not allergic to any food that I know of. Sometimes I get a little bit of a sniffle when the pollen is high, but that’s just seasonal, you know? Nothing serious at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. Not a bit of discomfort. It feels… normal, I suppose. It's just a bit tender right here, maybe. But it’s nothing really, just a little bit. I often feel a bit gassy, you know, being an older woman. Perhaps that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel a bit of mild tenderness there. It's not significant, but noted. Blood pressure is 130/80. That's well-controlled. Alright, everything seems normal so far. Given your history and the physical exam, these hiccups could be due to a number of things. Sometimes they’re just idiopathic – meaning we don’t know the exact cause – and resolve on their own. They can also be triggered by eating too quickly, certain medications, or even stress. The tenderness in your upper abdomen could be related to gas, as you mentioned. However, given they’ve persisted for a full day, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work just to rule out anything more serious. It's a precaution, but it will give us peace of mind. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. If it will give you peace of mind, then certainly. I trust your judgment completely. A chest X-ray and blood work… no problem at all. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It's just a bit embarrassing to be fussing over hiccups, but I suppose one shouldn’t ignore these things.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – it's always best to be cautious. And there’s no need to feel embarrassed – we're here to help, and it's my job to investigate. Okay, I’ll write the orders for the chest X-ray and blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can usually get you in right away. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street. I'll have the receptionist give you the requisitions and directions. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages, spicy foods, and eating large meals. Try to eat slowly and chew your food thoroughly. We'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can discuss the next steps then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. No carbonated drinks, spicy food… and slow eating. I can manage that. I suppose my daughter will be disappointed about the spicy food, though! But health comes first, of course. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. It's my pleasure. And don't worry about your daughter – a little bit of self-care is always worth it. The receptionist will be with you shortly with the requisitions. She'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, probably in a few days. If the hiccups worsen or you develop any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please don’t hesitate to call us right away. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything beautifully, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, which is more than I can say! I'll go and get the requisitions from the receptionist and take it from there. Thank you again for your time and kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
