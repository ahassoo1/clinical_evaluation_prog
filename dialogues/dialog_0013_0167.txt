DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, it’s good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aloha, Chriselda. Good to meet you too. My… my foot is hurting very bad. It has a sore, a deep one, and it won’t get better. It’s on my… my left foot, I think. I have… the sugar sickness, you know? The doctor told me about it many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. A sore on your left foot that’s not healing, and you have diabetes – or “sugar sickness” as you put it. That’s good information to start with. Just to clarify, how long has this sore been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… two, three months now? Hard to say exactly. Things get… blurry sometimes, you know? But it started small, and now… now it’s quite big. And it hurts to walk, even with slippers.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It’s common for things to feel a little blurry with time. Two or three months is helpful. And the pain is making it hard to walk, even with slippers. Okay. Has anything changed about the sore recently?
PATIENT: Changed… yes. It smells bad now. It didn't smell before. And… sometimes I feel cold in my foot, even when it’s warm outside. It’s a strange feeling. And… a little red around the sore, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bad smell, coldness in your foot, and redness around the sore. Thank you for telling me all of that, that's very important. It sounds like this could be more than just a simple sore. Let's take a look at it, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, yes. That sounds good. I’m not good with looking at it myself. Too hard to see, you know? You look, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m taking a look now. I see the sore here… it is quite deep, and there is some redness and swelling around it. Your pulses feel a little weak, and the area is warmer than it should be. I’m also noticing a small amount of drainage. Given your history of diabetes, and what you've told me about the smell and the coldness, it’s concerning for a possible infection, and potentially affecting the circulation in your foot. I’m going to need to order some blood work to check for infection and your blood sugar levels. We should also get an X-ray of your foot to see if the infection has affected the bone. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood work and… a picture of the bone? Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just want the pain to go away. Is it… is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know what you're feeling, Emiliano. And you're right to ask if it’s serious. Given your diabetes, foot sores can become serious quickly if they get infected, and affect the blood flow. That's why we need to investigate it thoroughly. The blood work and X-ray will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. I'll order those right away. In the meantime, it’s very important that you keep weight off your foot as much as possible. Are you able to use a walker or cane?
PATIENT: A cane, yes. I have a cane. My son gave it to me a long time ago. I don't use it often, but I can. I try to rest my foot, but… sometimes I forget, you know? And I walk around the house a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cane is good. And it's alright, it's common to forget things sometimes. Just try to use it as much as possible, even inside the house. We need to minimize the pressure on your foot. I'm going to write you a note for a special type of shoe, a diabetic shoe, which will help reduce pressure and prevent further injury. I'll also have the nurse come in and show you how to properly care for the sore at home – cleaning it, bandaging it, and looking for signs of worsening infection, like increased redness, swelling, pain, or drainage. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A special shoe… and the nurse will show me? Yes, that sounds good. I'm not very good with bandages, you see. My wife… she used to do it. But she is gone now. So the nurse showing me is very helpful.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Emiliano. It’s completely understandable to feel unsure when you’re used to someone else taking care of things. That’s exactly why I want the nurse to show you everything, and you can ask her any questions at all. She's very good at explaining things. We’ll also check your blood sugar today to see where things are at. Do you know what your typical blood sugar readings are, if you check them at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't check them at home. The doctor… the old doctor, he used to do it. He said I don’t need to check. Just come see him every few months. I haven’t seen a doctor in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. We'll definitely get your blood sugar checked today and discuss a plan for managing it going forward. It's important to keep it under control, especially with a foot sore like this. We may need to adjust your medication or refer you to a diabetes educator to help you learn more about managing your condition. Alright, let me call the nurse in to get started with the sore care instructions and get some blood drawn. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. The nurse… and the blood. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. It's been a long time since someone looked at my foot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. I'm happy to help. It's better to address things now, and we'll get you on a path to feeling better. I'll be right back with the nurse.
