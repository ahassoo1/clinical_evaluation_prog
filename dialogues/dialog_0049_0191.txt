DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to talk about, truthfully. I requested to come in for an HIV test. I wanted to get it checked, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Right. An HIV test. And what prompted you to request this testing now, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my husband, actually. He… he wasn't feeling well a few months back, and we went to a few different doctors, trying to figure out what was going on. It… it turned out to be something else, thankfully. But it got me thinking, you know? And I just… I haven’t been tested in a very long time. I thought it was best to be cautious.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say “something else,” could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. He had a bad infection, a chest infection, and they thought it might be pneumonia at first. But it turned out to be… bronchitis, quite severe, but thankfully, he’s recovered now. He’s doing much better, thank goodness. It just… it made me realize how easily things can… happen, you know? And I haven't really been careful, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: “Not careful,” Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Well… it’s a bit embarrassing to say. My husband and I… we've been married a long time, and we haven’t always… used protection. It was a long time ago, mostly, but… it just occurred to me that I should probably get checked, for peace of mind, really. It’s been weighing on my mind. I suppose I should have done it years ago.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s good you’re addressing it now. We'll certainly proceed with the HIV test. Before we do that, though, I need to ask a few more questions to get a clearer picture. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had a blood transfusion. I've been fairly healthy, all my life, thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I did have malaria once, when I visited Nigeria a long time ago, but I recovered fully. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Malaria is… unlikely to be directly relevant, but it’s good to know. Have you ever shared needles with anyone, for any reason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I’ve never used needles. Not even for vaccinations, if I could avoid it. I’m quite… squeamish, you see. And definitely not for anything else. I wouldn't dream of it. Is that… is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed previously?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a little… difficult. Many years ago, before I was married, I… I did have something. A… a small infection. It was treated quickly, though, and I don't remember the name of it. It was a long time ago, and my husband doesn't know. It wasn't a big deal, really. Just something I got when I was younger and… foolish. Does that matter, Doctor? I'm being honest, I promise.
DOCTOR: “Something”?
PATIENT: Well, I was quite young, and… embarrassed, even then. The doctor just told me what to take, and I took it. It cleared up quickly. I don’t remember the specifics. I was… trying to avoid a scandal, if you understand. It was a long time ago, before my marriage. It wasn't a serious illness, I assure you. Just a… a minor inconvenience. I really don't recall the name of it. Is it important, Doctor? Will it affect the test?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Shaub. Knowing the specific STI you had previously is crucial for accurate interpretation of the HIV test results. We need to know what was treated, and when. It impacts the type of test we use, and how we interpret the results. Do you have any records from that time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don't. I… I was living in a different city then, and I didn’t keep records of things like that. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I just… wanted to forget about it. It was a youthful mistake, and I moved on. I’m afraid I don't have any documentation. I apologize. Will that make it difficult, Doctor? Is it possible to do the test without knowing what it was? I just… I’m a bit flustered now.
DOCTOR: It complicates matters significantly, Ms. Shaub. Without knowing what infection you were previously treated for, interpreting the results will be… problematic. We can proceed with a standard HIV antibody test, but a negative result may not be entirely conclusive. We may need to consider further testing, including an HIV RNA test, which is more expensive. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. Expensive… I'm… I don't have insurance, Doctor. I hadn't really thought about the cost. I just… wanted to get this over with, to be sure. A negative result not being conclusive… that’s worrying. Is there anything else I can do? Can we try to find records, somehow? I suppose I could try to contact the doctor I saw back then, but it was so long ago… I doubt they'd still have anything. What would the RNA test involve, Doctor? And roughly how much more expensive is it? I'm really starting to regret bringing this up.
DOCTOR: Finding records after this much time is… unlikely. The RNA test involves a blood draw, and it detects the actual virus, rather than antibodies. It’s more sensitive, and more accurate, especially if you’ve had a previous infection. However, it’s significantly more expensive. Without insurance, it could be… several hundred dollars. Perhaps we should start with the standard antibody test. If that’s negative, and you remain concerned, we can discuss the RNA test then. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Several hundred dollars… goodness. Yes, I suppose we should start with the antibody test. That’s probably best. I just… I didn’t realize it would be so complicated, and so expensive. It’s just… peace of mind, really. If it’s negative, that will be something, at least. And if not… well, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Thank you, Doctor. What do I need to do now? Do I need to fast, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: No fasting is required. I’ll need to draw a small sample of blood. We’ll send it to the lab, and the results should be available in approximately one week. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. She’ll explain the aftercare instructions. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For your patience. I know I haven’t been very forthcoming with details, and it’s probably making your job more difficult. I just… it’s not easy to talk about these things. I hope the test is… alright.
