DOCTOR: Well, hello Chelise. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter... a notice from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper... something-lipidemia. I don't really understand all the big words, but they said I should come talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia… yes, I see it here. High cholesterol. It’s… common, frankly. Lots of people deal with it. Okay. So, the letter just said high cholesterol, or did it mention which numbers were elevated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It had a lot of numbers on it. I remember seeing something about… an LDL being too high? And an HDL being… not high enough, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, I just looked at it and got confused. I’m not good with all those medical things. Is LDL the bad one?
DOCTOR: Yes, LDL is the… less desirable one. The “bad” cholesterol, as people say. HDL is the good one. And frankly, these numbers… people get so worked up over numbers. Okay. Have you ever been told you have high cholesterol before this?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time anyone has mentioned it to me. I usually feel pretty healthy. I try to eat okay… lots of vegetables, not too much red meat. I walk my dog every day, too. A big Great Dane, so that’s a good walk! But… no, never any talk of cholesterol before now.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And do you have any family members – parents, siblings, anyone – who has had high cholesterol, heart disease, or maybe even a stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a heart attack when he was in his early seventies. And my mother… she had something with her blood pressure, I think. Not cholesterol, though. She took pills for it, always. And my brother, he’s a little overweight and the doctor always tells him to watch his diet. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts. Family history is… relevant. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the usual, Doctor. Something for my blood pressure, a very small dose. And a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sun. That’s it, really. Nothing for cholesterol or anything like that. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually. I can usually take whatever the doctor prescribes. I haven’t had any issues. Though, I do get a little sleepy from the blood pressure medicine sometimes, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look. Shouldn’t take long. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good. Let me just get up here then. It’s been a while since I had a proper check-up, honestly. It's good to get things looked at, I suppose. Let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular, but a little… distant. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is… acceptable, given your medication. No tenderness. No swelling or discoloration. Honestly, you seem… relatively healthy, all things considered. But the cholesterol needs addressing.
PATIENT: Well, that's good to hear, at least! I feel pretty good, most of the time. So, what does “addressing” it mean, Doctor? Do I need to change my diet drastically? Or… will I have to take pills? I was hoping to avoid pills, if possible. I'm just not a fan of taking a lot of medication.
DOCTOR: Look, Chelise, honestly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor? What do you think?
DOCTOR: The numbers aren't terrible, but they're not ideal, and given your family history… diet and exercise alone might be enough, but it's unlikely. The most effective way to manage cholesterol is with medication. A statin, most likely. It's… a small pill. You take it once a day. Honestly, people make such a fuss over statins. The benefits far outweigh the risks. We could try diet and exercise for three months, recheck the numbers, but frankly, I suspect it won't be enough. It’s… often a waste of time.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that's… not what I wanted to hear. A pill… even a small one… I just don’t like the idea of being on medication forever. Are there… side effects? I've heard things about muscle pain and… other things. I’m not sure I understand why it’s so important, if the numbers aren’t that bad. And… three months of strict dieting sounds… exhausting, honestly. I try to eat healthy already. What if I try really, really hard with the diet and exercise for three months, and then we recheck, and it’s still not enough? Will I have to take the pill anyway?
DOCTOR: Look, Chelise. You are making this much harder than it needs to be. Yes, there can be side effects with statins – muscle aches are the most common, but they are usually mild. And yes, if you try diet and exercise for three months and the numbers haven’t improved enough, you’ll likely need the medication anyway. But you’re right to be concerned about long-term medication. I'll write you a prescription for a low-dose statin. We can start there. If you experience any side effects, call me. And honestly?
PATIENT: Oh… a prescription already? I feel like I'm being pushed into this… I just wanted to understand everything better before making a decision. What if I could get a second opinion? Maybe another doctor would have a different approach? I don't mean to be difficult, Doctor, it's just… this feels very fast. I'm 54 years old, and I've never been on medication before. It's a big step.
DOCTOR: Look, Chelise, I understand you're hesitant. Fine. Get a second opinion. Honestly, it won't change anything. But I don’t have time to sit here and debate this all day. I have other patients to see. I’ll print you a referral to Dr. Ramirez. He’s… thorough. But he’ll tell you the same thing. And frankly, delaying treatment isn't going to help. High cholesterol is… insidious. It builds up over time. Here’s the referral. Call his office. Is there anything else, or are we finished?
PATIENT: Oh… well. Okay. Thank you, I guess. That’s… helpful. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you for your time, Doctor. I'll call Dr. Ramirez's office. It's just… it wasn't what I expected. .
