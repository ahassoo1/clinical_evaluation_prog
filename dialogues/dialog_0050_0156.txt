DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. I see you’re twenty years of age. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um... well, it’s my stomach, I think. It’s been… not good. Lots of… well, you know. Diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… persistent. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a long time, though.
DOCTOR: Persistent diarrhea, you say. And you’re unsure of the exact onset?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Vague, sorry. My husband usually reminds me of things like that. I just… feel it a lot, and it’s not stopping. It's… inconvenient, mostly. And a little worrying, I guess. I don't really know what's going on with it, or what causes it.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient and worrying. I understand. Can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Um… well, it’s… watery. Mostly. Sometimes… other things mixed in, but mostly watery. And… frequent. I go to the bathroom a lot. It doesn't really smell… bad, I don't think? I'm not sure, honestly. I just try to get it over with. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Watery, frequent… and not particularly foul-smelling. Alright. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No, I don't think so. I haven't really… looked, to be honest. I just… flush. Mucus… maybe? I don't know what mucus looks like, really. Sorry. I feel bad I can't be more helpful. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s not your responsibility to be a medical expert. Knowing what you have noticed is quite helpful. We can always perform a stool sample if necessary. Now, besides the diarrhea, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I've been… tired, a lot. Just generally feeling run down. And my stomach… it cramps sometimes. Not always, but yeah, cramps. And… I've lost a little weight, maybe? My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t really weighed myself recently. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, cramping, and possible weight loss. All pertinent information. Has this tiredness been a recent development, or have you generally felt fatigued?
PATIENT: It's… gotten worse recently, I think. I always feel a bit tired, but now it’s… harder to get going in the morning, you know? And I don't have much energy during the day. I used to be able to do more. I don't know… it just feels like a lot more effort to do everyday things. My husband says I'm more irritable, too. He jokes that I'm always grumpy.
DOCTOR: Increased fatigue, difficulty starting the day, and irritability… We're building a clearer picture. Now, have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No fever, I don’t think. And… no, no vomiting. Nausea… sometimes, maybe? A little queasy feeling, but nothing like throwing up. It comes and goes. Honestly, it's hard to tell if that's the diarrhea or something else. I don’t really get sick often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I think so? My doctor… a while ago… said something about… IBD? Or celiac? Something like that. I don’t really remember the details. My husband handles a lot of the medical stuff. I just know I have to be careful with what I eat sometimes. Is that it? Does that matter with… all of this?
DOCTOR: IBD—inflammatory bowel disease—or celiac disease… That is quite pertinent, Ms. Nahrwold. Do you recall any specific diagnoses or testing that was done regarding either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… oh, right. Yes. He said… celiac, I think? He said I had to avoid gluten. Something about… my insides not liking it. He did… blood tests, I think? And… a camera thing? Down my throat. It wasn't very nice. That was a while ago, though. And I've been… mostly okay, I thought. Just little tummy troubles sometimes. But not like this.
DOCTOR: Celiac disease, diagnosed previously, with a history of endoscopy… Ms. Nahrwold, have you been strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet since your diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh… well. Not… always. Sometimes I… cheat a little. I love bread. And cookies. My husband tries to keep me on track, but… it’s hard! Especially when we go out. And I don’t always remember what has gluten in it. Is that… bad? I'm really sorry. I know I should be better.
DOCTOR: Non-adherence to a gluten-free diet in the setting of diagnosed celiac disease could certainly explain these symptoms, Ms. Nahrwold. We need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a tissue transglutaminase antibody test to assess your current celiac status, as well as a complete blood count to evaluate for any signs of inflammation or anemia. We may also want to consider a stool sample to rule out any other potential causes for your diarrhea. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want this to stop. Blood tests and… the other thing? Okay. I just hope it doesn't take too long. And… is it going to hurt? Sorry, I just… get a bit anxious about medical things.
DOCTOR: Understandable, Ms. Nahrwold. The blood draw is routine—a minor discomfort, at most. And the stool sample… well, it’s just that—a sample. We’ll have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to strictly adhere to a gluten-free diet. I know it can be challenging, but it’s crucial for accurate testing and your overall health. Let's get the orders entered and the lab requisition printed. A nurse will be in shortly to assist you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. And… I'll try really hard with the gluten. I really will. It's just… difficult sometimes. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please let her know if you have any concerns.
