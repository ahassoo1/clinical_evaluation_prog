DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… well, it’s just annoying, you know? Not dangerous, I don’t think, but definitely bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching all over. And you said "a little while now"—can you give me a rough idea of how long we're talking?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably close to six weeks, maybe a little more. It started subtly, I just thought it was dry skin at first, you know? With the summer heat and all. But it hasn’t gone away, and it's actually gotten… more widespread, if that makes sense. It's not painful itching, just… constant.
DOCTOR: Constant itching for six weeks… alright. And has anything specific seemed to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, I haven't noticed anything specific. It doesn’t seem to be connected to what I eat, or what I’m wearing… I tried a new laundry detergent a few weeks ago, and I thought maybe that was it, so I switched back to my old one, but no change. Sunlight doesn’t make it better or worse, and neither does being inside. It just… is. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers with diet, detergents, or sunlight. That makes it a bit trickier. Has the itching been localized at all, even at the beginning, or has it truly been all over from the start?
PATIENT: It started on my arms, I think. Just a little bit on the insides of my elbows, really. But within a week, it had spread to my legs, then my back, then… well, pretty much everywhere. Now it's even on my scalp, which is… not fun. I’ve been trying not to scratch too much, but it's hard when it feels like it’s all over!
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started localized and then generalized. And you're trying to avoid scratching, which is good. Have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No rash, no bumps, no blisters… just redness. Sometimes it looks a little pink, sometimes a little… normal colored, but definitely not any visible changes beyond the redness. And definitely no oozing or anything like that. It’s just… itchy, red skin. I’ve been moisturizing a lot, but that doesn’t seem to help for very long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no rash, bumps, blisters, or oozing, just redness and itching. And moisturizing isn’t providing significant relief. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. No bee stings, no food allergies, no medication allergies… I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard, I think. I’ve had the usual colds and flus, but nothing serious. My wife… well, she had some allergies, but not me.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, really. And… well, sometimes I take a little bit of ibuprofen for my knees, but that’s it. Nothing regularly, just when they really bother me. And I take a multivitamin, just a basic one. Nothing fancy. Other than that, no. I try to stay away from medications as much as possible, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed for your knees and a multivitamin. And no other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but it came down with diet and exercise. The doctor said I was good, so I haven’t been on any medication for that in a long time. Otherwise, pretty healthy, I think, for my age. It’s just this itching… it’s really the only thing that's been bothering me. I'm a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure that’s now controlled with diet and exercise. Alright. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any skin conditions, allergies, or other medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had eczema when she was a child, I think. But I never did, and neither did my sister. My father had some heart trouble, but nothing skin-related. My wife’s family… her brother had asthma, but again, nothing that really stands out as relevant here. We didn’t talk about medical history much, if I'm honest. My wife passed away a few years ago, and… well, it’s hard to remember everything. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright. Loss makes it difficult to recall details. So, eczema in your mother, some heart trouble in your father, and nothing else that immediately stands out. Now, just a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never have, never will. My wife didn't smoke either. We both thought it was a terrible habit. I used to work around a lot of smokers when I was younger, but I always avoided it myself. And I don't drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol. And what do you do for work?
PATIENT: I’m a dispatcher. Not police or fire, mostly… well, transport. Medical transport, things like that. Mostly on the phone, coordinating things. It's not very physical, thankfully, with my knees and all. I’ve been doing it for a long time now. It’s a bit stressful sometimes, but it keeps me busy. And… I get good benefits, which is important.
DOCTOR: Okay, medical transport dispatcher. That can be stressful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just take a look at your skin, check your lymph nodes, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need to figure out what’s going on. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. It’s just… this itching is really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. I'm noting diffuse redness on your skin, without any obvious rash, blisters, or welts. No signs of excoriation, meaning no significant scratching. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Heart and lungs sound clear. Okay, so the exam doesn't reveal anything glaringly obvious. No signs of infection or anything immediately concerning on physical exam. The widespread redness is consistent with what you've described, though. Now, given the duration of your symptoms and the lack of a clear trigger, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out some common causes of generalized itching. It could be something simple, or it could be something a bit more complex. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work sounds… sensible. I’m just eager to find out what’s causing this, so I can hopefully get some relief. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: No fasting is necessary for the tests I’m ordering. We’ll just need a standard blood draw. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out thyroid problems, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause itching. We’ll also check your eosinophil count, as elevated eosinophils can be associated with allergic reactions or certain skin conditions. The lab is right down the hall. Once the results come back, usually within a couple of days, we'll review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin with a fragrance-free lotion, and avoid scratching as much as possible. We can also try an over-the-counter antihistamine, like loratadine or cetirizine, to see if it helps alleviate the itching. Do you have any allergies to any medications that I should be aware of before recommending an antihistamine?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to medications that I know of. Loratadine or cetirizine… those names sound familiar, I think. I’ll try one of those, and I’ll definitely keep moisturizing. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me, and for taking this seriously. It’s good to know we’re looking into it. And do I need an appointment to come back and discuss the results, or will you call me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’m glad I can help. And yes, please schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist for about a week from today to review the results. That will give the lab time to process everything and give us time to discuss them thoroughly. If the results come back quickly and I have any urgent concerns, I will certainly call you directly. Here's a lab requisition form. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Condray. I really appreciate your help. I’ll go get the blood work done, and I’ll see you next week. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers then.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You’re very welcome, Brendan. Get the blood work done at your convenience, and I’ll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care.
