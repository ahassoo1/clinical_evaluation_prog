DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, truthfully. But I suppose that’s what doctors are for. It’s a… a discharge. From… down there. I haven’t a clue what it is, and frankly, I’d rather not speculate. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand it can be uncomfortable to discuss these things, but you’ve come to the right place. We’ll figure this out. Can you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven't paid that much attention. I mean, one notices these things, of course, but I don’t go poking around. It's... wet. And a bit… off-colored. Not bright red, thankfully, more of a… yellowish tinge, I’d say. It’s been going on for a few days now, maybe a week. I really couldn’t say for sure, I don’t monitor these things religiously, Doctor. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: No, it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. A yellowish discharge isn’t typical, and we need to investigate. Has there been any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… there is a smell. Not… terrible, mind you. But not pleasant, either. Sort of… fishy, perhaps? It’s faint, I don’t usually smell things very well, but when I’m… freshening up, I’ve noticed it. Is that… bad? It sounds awful, doesn’t it? Honestly, I take very good care of myself. This is quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Ms. Wartick. Don’t be upset. A fishy odor can be a sign of an infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you experienced any itching, burning, or pain in the vaginal area?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, thankfully. And not much itching, either. Perhaps a little… sensitivity, if I’m being honest. But nothing unbearable. It's just… uncomfortable knowing something is wrong, you understand? I don’t usually have… issues. I keep things very clean, I assure you. I just... I wouldn't know where to begin looking for information on this sort of thing. Everything online is so… dramatic.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're keeping things clean, but sometimes that's not enough. Alright, Ms. Wartick, I'm going to need to perform a quick pelvic exam to take a look and collect a sample. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Oh dear. Well… I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? I’ve… not had one in quite some time. Is it going to be… unpleasant? I really dislike doctors poking around. And will it take long? I have a luncheon planned for two o'clock, with the ladies from the church, and I wouldn’t want to be late. It's Mildred's birthday, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. It won't be comfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go. It shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. We’ll get a better idea of what’s going on, and hopefully, get you back to Mildred’s birthday lunch on time. If you're comfortable, we can go ahead now. You’ll need to undress from the waist down, and I’ll provide a gown and a sheet.
PATIENT: Well… alright. If you insist. It’s just… undignified, really. But I suppose a doctor’s work is never pretty. I do hope you have a good reputation, Doctor. I wouldn’t want to end up with some sort of… complication. Is it terribly cold in there? I always get chilled so easily. And please, be quick about it. Mildred makes a wonderful lemon meringue pie. I wouldn't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Wartick, I have many years of experience and prioritize patient comfort. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And yes, I can adjust the temperature if you’re cold. I'm just going to take a quick look first. I notice some mild redness, but no obvious sores. Now, I'm going to use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. I’ll use lubricant to make it more comfortable. Just relax, and breathe deeply. Okay, just a moment… I’m collecting a sample now. It may feel a little strange, but shouldn't be painful. Okay, all done. We’ll send this sample to the lab for analysis. We should have results in a few days.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Finished already? That was rather… intrusive, Doctor. I do hope you were careful. So, what do you think it is? Is it something serious? I really don’t have time for a long illness. I volunteer at the library on Wednesdays, you see, and Mildred is counting on me to help with the bake sale next week. Will I be able to continue my activities? And, honestly, Doctor, did you wash your hands properly after? One can never be too careful with germs, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wartick. I always practice strict hygiene protocols. Based on the initial exam, it’s likely a vaginal infection, possibly bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. It’s rarely serious, and usually easily treated with medication. We'll need the lab results to confirm, but I'm going to go ahead and prescribe a course of Metronidazole gel, just to be on the safe side. It's a topical antibiotic and antifungal. I don't anticipate any major side effects. This should resolve the symptoms within a week. Continue to monitor yourself, and if the symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a week, please call the office. As for continuing your activities, yes, you should be able to continue as usual. Just avoid douching or using scented feminine products while you’re being treated. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… sounds dreadful. Are there any… alternatives? I do have a rather sensitive constitution, you see. And what about the luncheon? Will I be… contagious? I wouldn’t want to spread anything to the other ladies. Mildred would be furious. And will this gel… stain my clothing? I have a new silk blouse I was planning to wear, and I wouldn’t want to ruin it. Honestly, Doctor, these medications always seem to have the most unpleasant side effects. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again? Perhaps a special soap? Or a different type of underwear?
DOCTOR: Those are all valid concerns, Ms. Wartick. Metronidazole is often the first line of treatment, but if you're particularly sensitive, we can discuss a topical Clindamycin cream as an alternative, though it may be slightly less effective. It's unlikely you're contagious, but it’s always a good idea to practice good hygiene, as with any infection. As for staining, it’s rare, but it can happen. Wear a pantyliner to prevent any contact with your clothing. To prevent recurrence, avoid douching, scented feminine products, and tight-fitting clothing. Cotton underwear is always best, as it allows for better ventilation. And, while there are special soaps marketed for vaginal health, they're often unnecessary and can even disrupt the natural balance of bacteria. The best course of action is simply to maintain good hygiene and avoid irritants. I’ve made a note of your concerns and the alternative medication. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose that will do. Cotton underwear… yes, I used to wear that. Perhaps I should go back to that. And I will definitely wear a pantyliner. Honestly, Doctor, you’ve been surprisingly helpful, considering. Though I still think these medications sound rather alarming. One last thing… how much will this cost? I am on a fixed income, you see, and Medicare doesn’t cover everything. I wouldn't want any unpleasant surprises when the bill arrives. And… is there a follow-up appointment necessary? I really dislike coming to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. The cost of the medication should be relatively low, around $20-$30 with your Medicare coverage. I'll have the office staff verify the exact amount for you before you leave. As for a follow-up, it's not strictly necessary unless your symptoms don't improve after a week. However, I always recommend a check-up within six months to ensure everything remains normal. I’ve made a note of everything we discussed. Please call the office if you have any concerns. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
