DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Pirl. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well… it’s my water, I guess. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. Trouble with complete bladder emptying can be quite bothersome, indeed. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you tell me, approximately how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… three, four months now? It started slow, just feeling like I didn't quite finish, you know? Then it got… more noticeable. It’s not every time, but often enough that I worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, starting gradually. And it’s not a consistent issue, but frequent enough to cause concern. That’s helpful to know. Now, when you do go, do you feel any pain or burning?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. Not burning, not anything like that. It just… feels like there's still some left in there, even when I've tried… pushing. It's not comfortable, but it doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or burning, just a sensation of incomplete emptying. That's important. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urinary stream – is it weak, forceful, or does it start and stop?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, it's not as strong as it used to be, I reckon. Not weak exactly, but… takes a bit longer to get going. And sometimes, it’ll… sputter a little bit, then steady out. I hadn’t really thought much on it until now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright; that's what we're here for. Sputtering and a slower start can be indicative of a few things. Now, could you tell me about how much fluid you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, not too much, I don’t think. I mostly drink water. Maybe… six, seven glasses a day? Sometimes a little coffee in the morning, but not a lot. I don't go out of my way to drink more than that, if you know what I mean. I always figured drinking too much wasn’t good for you.
DOCTOR: That’s reasonable. Six to seven glasses of water is… fairly typical. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Hmm. Not really, no. Everything's been… regular, I suppose. I try to eat my fruits and vegetables. Nothing unusual there.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Just checking. Now, are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever or chills. And my back's been fine. A little achy sometimes from bending, but that’s just getting old, I expect. No real pain in my back.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a somewhat personal question, and you are free to decline to answer if you are not comfortable. Have you noticed any difficulty initiating urination, or any urgency or frequency in needing to go?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I do have to… wait a little sometimes before it starts. Not a long time, mind you. Just a few seconds. And… sometimes I feel like I gotta go pretty sudden-like. Not all the time, but it happens. It’s… a little embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: There’s no need to be embarrassed, Mr. Hilber. These are important things to discuss. Waiting a few seconds to start and experiencing some urgency are both relevant. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I used to have high blood pressure, years ago. The doctor put me on some pills for a while, but I haven't taken them in… oh, must be ten years now? He said I could try to manage it with my diet and exercise, and it went down. Haven’t been to a doctor regular since… my wife… she always took care of that. And no, no diabetes that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Past hypertension, currently managed with diet and exercise, and no known diabetes. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just… trying to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Hilber, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. This will involve checking your abdomen and a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. If you think it’ll help, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you. If you could please lie down on the examination table, that would be great. We'll start with your abdomen. I'll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Now, does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt… just feels… like you’re poking around. A little strange, but not painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s just check your lower back. Please let me know if anything feels particularly sensitive. And how about here?
PATIENT: No, that feels fine too, Doctor. A little stiff maybe, but not painful. Like I said, I do bend a lot working. Just getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And I’m just going to check your reflexes quickly. Okay, reflexes are present and symmetrical. Now, one last quick thing - I will listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Everything sounds normal there as well. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, although it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. BPH is common as men age and can cause changes in urinary flow and frequency. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order a urinalysis and a PSA blood test to get a more complete picture of what’s going on. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the PSA test can help assess your prostate health. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh my. Benign… what did you call it? Sounds serious. And a test… for my prostate? Never had one of them before. Look, Doctor, I ain't good with all these medical terms. Just tell me… is it something bad? And what’s involved in these tests? Is it going to hurt? I don't want anything painful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber, and it's perfectly reasonable to be anxious. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia simply means an enlargement of the prostate gland, which is very common as men get older. It's not cancer, and it's usually not a serious condition, though it can be uncomfortable and disruptive. Think of it like this – as we age, the prostate gland tends to grow, and it can sometimes press on the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, causing the symptoms you're experiencing. The tests are quite straightforward. The urinalysis is a simple urine sample – you’ll just need to provide a small cup of urine. It doesn’t hurt at all. The PSA test is a blood test, just like any other. We'll take a small sample from your arm – a quick prick, and a little discomfort, but it's over quickly. These tests will help us determine the best course of action, which could be as simple as lifestyle changes, medication, or, in some cases, a minor procedure. But let’s get the test results first and then we can discuss everything in detail. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better, I reckon. Not cancer, you say? That’s a relief. And just a quick prick… I can handle a quick prick. And a sample… alright. I can do a sample. So… we just get these tests done, and then you’ll tell me what’s going on? And what I need to do? Where do I go to… do the sample? And the prick?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. We’ll get the tests done, and then I’ll review the results with you and explain everything in detail. We'll discuss all your options and come up with a plan that’s best for you. You can head over to the lab just down the hall – room 203. The nurse there will give you a cup for the urine sample, and they’ll take the blood sample as well. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back—usually within 24-48 hours—my assistant, Sarah, will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me. Do you have any questions before you head over to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think… that covers it. Room 203, right? And Sarah will call… That sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor Pirl. You've… eased my mind a bit. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I was getting worried there for a minute. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
