DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, it’s about getting some shots. A friend of mine is… well, she’s trying to get her papers to stay here, and she said I need to come talk to a doctor about what vaccinations she needs. I’m a bit confused about it all, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Skarbek, I understand. It sounds like your friend needs documentation of certain vaccinations for her immigration paperwork. That's perfectly alright, it can be a bit confusing. I'm happy to help clarify what she'll need. To start, do you happen to know what country she’s coming from?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… she's from… Guatemala, I believe. Yes, Guatemala. She’s been here a few years now, but she’s finally trying to get everything official. I don't know much about the paperwork itself, she’s handling that. I just offered to help with the doctor part.
DOCTOR: Okay, Guatemala. That's helpful. There are specific recommendations based on country of origin. Let me pull up the current CDC guidelines for Guatemala… Alright, so for an adult immigrating from Guatemala, the standard recommended vaccinations include evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, rubella , varicella , diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis , polio, influenza, and hepatitis B. She'll likely also need a tuberculosis screening. Do you know if she has any records of prior vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. That’s… a lot of shots. She might have some records, but I honestly don’t know. She didn’t bring anything with her today. She’s a very private person, and doesn't talk much about her life before coming here. I didn't want to push her about it. Would it be possible to figure out what she needs without records? Or maybe there's a way to get them from Guatemala?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. It’s not uncommon to lack records in these situations. We can definitely proceed without them, though it may mean she needs to receive some vaccinations as a precaution. We can perform a blood test to check for immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. That will tell us if she already has protection. The other vaccinations – diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, influenza, and hepatitis B – we would likely need to administer a series of shots. Before we go that route, is she comfortable with me trying to contact any health officials in Guatemala to attempt to locate records?
PATIENT: That's... a thoughtful offer, Doctor. I think contacting people in Guatemala might be a bit upsetting for her. She’s had a hard life, and talking about the past is difficult. I wouldn’t want to cause her any unnecessary stress. So, if we can’t find the records, we just… get the shots? Are they… painful? And how many would she need? I’m just trying to prepare her. She gets nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's completely reasonable. We’ll respect her privacy and proceed without contacting anyone in Guatemala. Yes, if we can't locate records, we’ll proceed with vaccinations based on the CDC recommendations. As for pain, the shots do cause a brief stinging sensation, but it's usually very manageable. We can use a numbing cream if she's particularly concerned. She’d likely need a series of shots spread out over several visits. For example, she'd need a Tdap booster, a Hepatitis B series , and potentially a Polio booster depending on her age and prior vaccination status. We'll determine that after discussing her medical history a bit more. Before we get into that, do you know if she has any allergies, or any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, to the best of my knowledge, she doesn’t have any allergies. She’s a very healthy woman, works hard, eats well… mostly. She did mention, a while back, that she had some trouble with her blood pressure a few times, but she said it went away on its own. It was years ago, though. She doesn't go to the doctor much, if that makes sense. She’s very independent and doesn’t like to complain. Is high blood pressure something we need to worry about with the shots?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know she's generally healthy. And thank you for mentioning the blood pressure issue, even if it was years ago. It's important information. Yes, uncontrolled high blood pressure can be a concern with vaccinations. We’ll definitely need to check her blood pressure today before administering any shots. If it's elevated, we might need to get that under control first before proceeding. It's not something we want to take lightly. Let’s start with a quick review of her general health. Has she ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... to be honest, I don’t think so. She’s very careful, always watching what she eats and trying to stay active. She had a bad fall a few years back, working in the garden, but it wasn't serious enough for a hospital. Just a sprained ankle, she said. She healed up quickly, though. She's very strong. She's also never had any major surgeries, as far as I know. She doesn't talk about her past much, so it's hard for me to say for sure. I'm sorry if I'm not much help. I just know she's generally a healthy person.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Skarbek. You’re providing me with valuable information, and I appreciate your honesty. It's completely understandable that she doesn’t share much about her past. Since she's generally healthy with no reported hospitalizations or surgeries, that's a good starting point. Now, has anyone in her family had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. She doesn’t really talk about her family. She left Guatemala a long time ago and doesn’t have much contact with them anymore. She mentioned, once, that her mother had some trouble with her heart, but that was years ago, and she didn't have any details. She also said her brother had some sort of sickness when he was a child, but I don’t know what kind. Honestly, I don’t have much information about her family medical history. I’m really sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… a sensitive topic for her.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. I understand. It's not your responsibility to know her family history, and we can proceed without it. We’ll just be a bit more cautious and monitor her closely. Let's move on to her current medications and lifestyle. Does she take any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, she doesn’t take any regular medications. She likes natural remedies, if anything. She’ll drink chamomile tea for sleep, or use aloe vera for skin problems. But she doesn’t take any pills or anything like that. As for lifestyle, she works very hard in a greenhouse. It's physical work, lots of lifting and bending. She eats pretty healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. She doesn’t drink much alcohol, and she doesn’t smoke. She's a very simple woman, lives a quiet life. She gets a good amount of exercise from her work, I suppose. She does worry a lot, though. That’s probably not good for her. Is worrying bad for your health?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know. Avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol are excellent habits. And it’s good she’s active. You're right to be concerned about her worrying. Chronic stress can definitely have a negative impact on health. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are there any particular concerns she has that she'd like me to address?
PATIENT: That's a good question. She mostly just worries about the paperwork, getting everything right for her stay. She’s a very anxious person, always afraid of making a mistake. She’s also a little nervous about the shots, but she knows she needs them. She’s very brave, but she gets scared easily. I think she’s mostly just afraid of the unknown. She asked me to make sure everything is safe and that you’re a good doctor. She trusts my judgment, so that’s why she came to you with me. She doesn’t like doctors much, but she’s willing to try if I say it’s okay. She also asked if the shots will make her sick, like with a fever or something. She can’t afford to be sick, she has to work.
DOCTOR: That's very kind of her to share that with me. Please reassure her that I will do my best to ensure her safety and comfort. I understand her concerns about the paperwork and potential side effects. It’s true that some people experience mild side effects after vaccinations, such as a low-grade fever, soreness at the injection site, or fatigue. However, these symptoms are usually mild and resolve within a day or two. It's very rare to become seriously ill from a vaccination. We’ll monitor her closely and address any concerns that arise. Okay, with her permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check her blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to her lungs. I’ll also take a look at her vaccination record, if she has any with her. Does she consent to that?
PATIENT: Yes, she does. She said I can tell you anything. She trusts you, Doctor. She's a bit shy, so she might not say much during the exam, but she'll let you do what you need to do. And thank you for being so patient and understanding. She appreciates it. She's a good woman, just a little scared and overwhelmed. She's always worried about everything. She said to tell you to take your time and be gentle. And she's sorry if she's being difficult.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Skarbek. It's my job to make her feel comfortable and safe. And please, don't apologize for her. I'm happy to take my time and be as gentle as possible. Alright, let's start with checking her blood pressure. Could she please sit comfortably in the chair and keep her arm relaxed?
PATIENT: She’s ready, Doctor. She said she’s a little nervous about the blood pressure thing, she's always worried about her numbers. But she'll try to relax. Just let me know if she needs to stop. She gets a little dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Skarbek. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. She can just take a few deep breaths and try to relax her arm. … Okay. 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Now, I’m just going to listen to her heart and lungs. She can just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Overall, her physical exam is unremarkable, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. It’s likely related to anxiety, but we’ll keep a close eye on it. Before we proceed with discussing vaccinations, I recommend we repeat her blood pressure reading in a few minutes to confirm the result. While we wait, does she have any questions for me?
PATIENT: She says she… she's worried about having to come back. She has to work, and she doesn't get paid if she misses a day. She said if the shots make her feel sick, she'll lose money. And she doesn't have much money to begin with. Is there… is there anything we can do to make sure she doesn’t get too sick? Maybe something she can take beforehand? She’s a very hardworking woman, and she doesn’t want to fall behind. She’s always worrying about money.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Skarbek. I understand her worry about missing work and losing income. It's important to address that. Unfortunately, there's no medication that can guarantee she won’t experience any side effects from the vaccinations. However, we can take some steps to minimize the risk and manage any symptoms if they do occur. First, I recommend she stay well-hydrated in the days leading up to and following the vaccinations. That can help reduce the risk of fever and fatigue. Second, she can take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, after receiving the shots, if she experiences any soreness or discomfort. And third, she should avoid strenuous activity for a day or two following the vaccinations. I can also provide her with a note for her employer explaining that she received vaccinations and may need to take a day or two off if she experiences any side effects. To be completely transparent, most people only experience mild side effects that resolve within a day or two. But I understand her anxiety, and we’ll do everything we can to support her. Would she like me to write a note for her employer now?
PATIENT: Yes, she would really appreciate that, Doctor. Thank you so much. She said it would give her some peace of mind. And she said she’ll try to drink more water and take it easy. She’s a very strong woman, and she’ll do her best. She just gets worried easily. She’s always been a worrier. Is there anything else she should do, or anything she should avoid? She wants to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s a note stating she received vaccinations today and may require a day or two of rest if experiencing any side effects. I've included my contact information if her employer has any questions. As for other things she should do or avoid, I recommend she avoid taking any new medications or supplements before receiving the vaccinations, as they could interact with the vaccine. She should also inform me of any allergies or medical conditions she has, if she hasn’t already. Most importantly, she should rest well and stay hydrated in the days leading up to and following the vaccinations. And she should contact me immediately if she experiences any severe side effects, such as a high fever, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face or throat. Now, are there any questions she has for me before we proceed with discussing the specific vaccinations she needs?
PATIENT: She’s asking… she’s worried about the shots hurting. She’s always been afraid of needles. And she’s asking if they’ll all be given at the same time, or if she’ll have to come back multiple times. She said she really doesn’t like needles. It makes her very nervous. She said if she has to come back multiple times, she might have to miss more work. She’s really worried about the money. She’s a very brave woman, but she’s scared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable concern, Mr. Skarbek. Many people are afraid of needles, and it’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. I can assure you I will do everything I can to make the experience as comfortable as possible. I can use a numbing cream before giving the shots to minimize the discomfort. I can also distract her during the process, if that helps. As for whether she’ll need to come back multiple times, the answer is yes. Unfortunately, she’ll need to come back for a series of vaccinations. The specific number of visits will depend on the vaccines she needs. For example, she’ll need three doses of the Hepatitis B vaccine, spread out over six months. She’ll also need a booster shot for Tdap. And she may need a booster shot for Polio, depending on her vaccination history. I understand her concern about missing work, and I will do my best to schedule the appointments at times that are convenient for her. I can also provide her with a note for her employer explaining the reason for the appointments. Before we proceed, would she like me to explain each of the vaccinations in more detail?
PATIENT: She said yes, please. She wants to know what each one is for, and if they’re really necessary. She’s a very practical woman, and she wants to understand why she needs them. She said she doesn’t want to waste her time or money on something that isn’t important. She’s a little skeptical, but she’s willing to listen. She trusts your judgment, Doctor, but she wants to be informed.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's start with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine. This vaccine protects against three highly contagious viral infections. Measles can cause serious complications, including pneumonia and brain damage. Mumps can cause swelling of the salivary glands, and Rubella can cause birth defects in pregnant women. It’s very important to be protected against these infections. Next, the Varicella vaccine protects against chickenpox. While chickenpox is usually mild, it can cause serious complications in adults, such as pneumonia and shingles. The Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis vaccine protects against three bacterial infections. Diphtheria can cause difficulty breathing and heart failure. Tetanus can cause painful muscle spasms. And Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, can cause severe coughing fits. The Polio vaccine protects against a viral infection that can cause paralysis. While polio has been eradicated in most parts of the world, it’s still present in some countries, and it’s important to be protected. The Influenza vaccine protects against the flu, a viral infection that can cause fever, cough, and body aches. The flu can be serious, especially for older adults and people with underlying medical conditions. Finally, the Hepatitis B vaccine protects against a viral infection that can cause liver damage. Hepatitis B can be spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth. These vaccinations are all recommended by the CDC, and they are essential for protecting her health. They are also required for immigration purposes. Do you have any questions about any of these vaccinations?
PATIENT: She's asking… if she's already had some of these as a child, does she still need them? She remembers getting some shots when she was little, but she doesn't remember which ones. She's worried about getting unnecessary shots. She's a very practical woman, and she doesn't want to waste her time or money. And she’s asking if there’s any chance she could get sick from the shots, like with a fever or something. She has to work, and she can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: That's an excellent question, Mr. Skarbek. It's true that if she already had some of these vaccinations as a child, she may not need them again. However, it's difficult to know for sure without documentation. The immunity from childhood vaccinations can wane over time, and it's important to ensure she's fully protected. That's why we'll start with a blood test to check her immunity to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. If she's already immune, she won't need that vaccine. If she's not immune, she'll need to receive two doses of the vaccine. As for the chance of getting sick from the shots, it's true that some people experience mild side effects after receiving vaccinations, such as a low-grade fever, soreness at the injection site, or fatigue. However, these symptoms are usually mild and resolve within a day or two. It's very rare to become seriously ill from a vaccination. We can take some steps to minimize the risk of side effects, such as staying well-hydrated and avoiding strenuous activity. We can also provide her with over-the-counter pain relievers to manage any discomfort. Do you have any other questions about the vaccinations or the side effects?
PATIENT: She says she… she's worried about the blood test. She doesn't like needles, and she's afraid it will hurt. And she's asking if the blood test is expensive. She doesn't have much money, and she's worried about the cost. She's a very practical woman, and she's always worried about the cost of things. She said she really needs to know if it's expensive before she agrees to it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Skarbek. I understand her worry about the blood test. It’s perfectly normal to be afraid of needles. The blood test is relatively quick and painless. It only involves a small prick of the finger, and it doesn’t hurt much. It’s similar to getting a finger prick for a glucose test. As for the cost, the blood test is covered by most insurance plans. If she has private insurance, her out-of-pocket cost will likely be minimal. I can check her insurance coverage and give you an exact estimate before proceeding. If she doesn’t have insurance, we can discuss options for financial assistance. We don't want the cost to be a barrier to her receiving the care she needs. I can also explain the blood test in more detail. It involves taking a small sample of her blood and sending it to a lab for analysis. The lab will check for antibodies to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. If she has antibodies, she’s already immune and won’t need that vaccine. If she doesn’t have antibodies, she’ll need to receive the vaccine. Do you have any other questions about the blood test or the cost?
PATIENT: She’s saying… she does have insurance. She has a card somewhere in her purse. But she’s worried about having to come back multiple times for the shots. She has to work, and she can’t afford to miss too many days. She said she really needs to know how many visits it will take before she agrees to it. She’s a very practical woman, and she needs to plan her schedule carefully. She also asks if you can give her a written schedule of the appointments, so she can show her employer. She’s very worried about losing her job. She trusts you, Doctor, but she’s scared.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable request, Mr. Skarbek. I completely understand her concern about the number of visits and the need to plan her schedule carefully. Losing her job is a legitimate fear, and I want to do everything I can to help her avoid that. Let me take a look at her insurance card. Okay, it looks like she has good coverage. The blood test should be covered with a minimal copay. As for the number of visits, it depends on the results of the blood test. If she’s already immune to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella, she won’t need that vaccine and will only need a few visits for the other vaccines. If she’s not immune to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella, she’ll need two doses of that vaccine, spread out over several weeks. Here’s a rough estimate of the schedule: Visit 1: Blood test to check immunity to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. Visit 2 : First dose of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine. Visit 3 : Second dose of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine. Visit 4: Tdap booster shot. Visit 5 : Hepatitis B vaccine series . I can create a written schedule for her, with specific dates and times, once we have the results of the blood test. I can also provide her with a note for her employer explaining the reason for the appointments. Do you have any other questions about the schedule or the appointments?
PATIENT: She's asking… if she gets the shots, will she be able to travel? She has family in Guatemala that she hasn't seen in a long time, and she wants to visit them. But she's worried about getting sick during her trip, or getting stuck in another country if she gets a fever. She's very worried about getting sick and being separated from her family. She's also asking if the shots will affect her ability to work. She's a hardworking woman, and she can't afford to miss too many days. She trusts you, Doctor, but she's scared. She says she really needs to know if she'll be able to travel safely after getting the shots.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Skarbek. It’s understandable that she wants to be able to travel safely after getting the shots. And it's wise to consider the potential impact on her work. Generally, after completing the vaccination series, she should be able to travel without any restrictions. The vaccinations will protect her against many of the common infectious diseases in Guatemala. However, it’s important to follow some basic travel precautions, such as avoiding contaminated food and water, and practicing good hygiene. As for the impact on her work, she may experience mild side effects after receiving the vaccinations, such as a low-grade fever, soreness at the injection site, or fatigue. These symptoms are usually mild and resolve within a day or two. She can take over-the-counter pain relievers to manage any discomfort. I can also provide her with a note for her employer explaining the reason for the appointments and requesting a few days of rest if needed. I recommend she consult with a travel medicine specialist before traveling to Guatemala. They can provide her with specific recommendations based on her health status and travel itinerary. They can also prescribe any necessary medications, such as antidiarrheal drugs or malaria prophylaxis. Do you have any other questions about traveling or the vaccinations?
PATIENT: She’s saying… okay. She’s ready to do the blood test. She trusts you, Doctor, and she wants to get this over with. But she’s asking if it will hurt a lot. She’s always been afraid of needles. She said she really needs to know if it will hurt a lot before she agrees to it. She's very worried about the pain. She also asks if you can be quick about it. She doesn't want to be here all day. She’s a very practical woman, and she needs to get back to work.
DOCTOR: That’s great, Mr. Skarbek. I understand her anxiety about the needle, and I will do everything I can to make it as quick and painless as possible. The blood test involves a small prick of the finger, and it only takes a few seconds. It shouldn't hurt a lot. It's similar to getting a finger prick for a glucose test. I’ll use a sterile lancet, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. I can also distract her during the process, if that helps. I’ll be as quick as possible, and I’ll let you know when it’s over. It won’t take long. Okay, just relax your hand for me. This will just take a moment. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure for a moment to stop the bleeding. See?
PATIENT: She flinches slightly, but nods. "That wasn't too bad," she says quietly. "How long until we know the results?" She looks a little relieved it's over, but still seems anxious. She asks, “Do I need to do anything special now? Like… avoid touching it?” She carefully examines her finger.
DOCTOR: That wasn't too bad at all, you were very brave. And yes, you're right to be cautious. Just keep the bandage on for a little while to prevent any infection. Avoid touching it too much and try not to get it wet. It should heal quickly. As for the results, the lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process the blood test. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results. If we need to schedule any further appointments, I’ll let you know then. For now, just relax and take it easy. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: She shakes her head slowly. “No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you so much for your patience. You’ve been very kind.” She carefully tucks her hand into her purse. “I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I was very worried, but I feel much better now.” She offers a small, grateful smile. “I'll wait for your call.”
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It was my pleasure. I understand your anxiety, and I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be in touch soon with the results. Have a good day, and take care.
