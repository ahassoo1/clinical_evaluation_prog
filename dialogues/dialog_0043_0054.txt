DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... cough, yeah. Been coughing a lot. And... tired. Always feel tired, you know? And my nose... always stuffy. Feels blocked. Sorry, not very good with explaining. It's been going on for... a while now, I think. Long time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tati. It's perfectly alright if you're not sure of the exact timeframe. "A while now" gives me a good starting point. Could you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: Uh... it's a wet cough. Like... stuff coming up. Sometimes it's worse at night. Makes it hard to sleep. And... it’s not... a bad cough, but it won't go away. I try drink water, but it doesn't help much. Does that make sense? I don't know what kind of cough it is... sorry.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Tati. A wet cough, meaning you’re bringing up mucus, and it’s worse at night – that’s helpful information. And you've already tried increasing your fluid intake, which is a good first step. Now, regarding the tiredness and stuffy nose – do those symptoms happen at the same time as the cough, or do they come and go independently?
PATIENT: Hmm... mostly together. Cough, then tired, then nose blocked. Sometimes nose blocked before cough, but usually together. It’s... hard to say exactly. Feels like they all come at once sometimes. I get... maybe a fever sometimes? Not high fever, just feel warm. My wife, she checks sometimes. I forget. Sorry. It's all a bit mixed up in my head.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint everything. It sounds like there’s some overlap in your symptoms. Feeling warm suggests a possible low-grade fever, as you mentioned. Let’s delve a little deeper. Have you noticed anything that makes the cough or other symptoms worse?
PATIENT: Uh... dust. Definitely dust. Work with tires all day, you know? Lots of dust. Cough gets worse then. And... maybe cold air? When it's windy, I feel worse. Not much worse, but... yeah. And sometimes, I think, when I’m stressed. Work is… busy. Sorry, I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Tati. Identifying triggers like dust and stress is important. Do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh... I don't think so. Never been to see a doctor for allergies. My wife… she sometimes sneezes a lot with flowers, but I'm okay. I don't get itchy eyes or anything. Just the cough and tired, and blocked nose. Sorry, I really don't know about allergies.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Tati. That's perfectly fine. We’ll proceed as if there are no known allergies for now. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Nothing major. I broke my arm when I was young, playing football. But that was a long time ago. No hospital... no serious sicknesses. Maybe... the flu a few times? But just normal flu, you know? Stayed home, drank water. My wife takes care of me when I'm sick. Sorry, I can't really remember anything big. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tati. It sounds like you’ve generally been in good health, which is positive. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had surgery. No. I don't like hospitals, Doctor. Sorry. Too many needles. And... I get worried. My wife said I get scared. But no surgeries. Never had one.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Tati. Many people feel anxious about hospitals. It's good to know you haven't had any surgeries. Now, I'd like to ask about your family's medical history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father... he had problems with his heart. Old age, I think. He had trouble breathing sometimes. But he smoked a lot. My mother… she was okay, I think. No big sicknesses. My wife's mother… she had something with her blood, maybe diabetes? I forget. Sorry. We don't really talk about sicknesses much. It's... bad luck. But yeah, heart problems with my father. Maybe diabetes with my wife's mother. I really don't know much. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tati. It’s helpful to know about your father’s heart problems and the possibility of diabetes in your wife’s mother. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Uh... I work. Tire repair. Long hours. I eat... rice, mostly. And chicken. My wife cooks. Sometimes fish. Not much exercise. Too tired. And... I don't smoke. Never smoked. And... I drink maybe one or two beers on the weekend. Sometimes. Sorry. I don't really have a lifestyle. Just work and home.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good understanding, Mr. Tati. And there’s nothing wrong with that—work is important. Now, do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing. Just... sometimes I take a painkiller for my back, when it’s really sore from work. But not every day. Just… when it's bad. My wife buys it from the shop. Sorry, I don't know what it’s called. Small white pill. That's all. No vitamins. No supplements. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you are generally quite healthy otherwise. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your nose and throat, and take your temperature. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that’s okay. But… please be quick? I need to get back to work. Sorry. I don’t want to take up too much time. Quick is good. And… not too cold, the stethoscope? I get scared.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tati. I'll be as quick as possible, and I'll make sure the stethoscope is warmed first. First, let’s take your temperature. Now, if you could just take a deep breath for me while I listen to your lungs. And now, let's listen to your heart. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your nose and throat. Okay, that’s all. I’ve noted some mild wheezing in your lungs, some nasal congestion, and redness in your throat. Your temperature is slightly elevated, but nothing concerning at the moment.
PATIENT: Okay. Wheezing? What’s that? Is it bad? And… my throat just hurts a little. Sorry, I don't know what any of that means. Is it the dust? From work? I need to get back to work soon, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Wheezing is a whistling sound in your lungs, Mr. Tati, and it can indicate some narrowing of the airways. In your case, it’s mild, and it’s certainly possible that the dust from your work is contributing to it. It’s not immediately alarming, but it does suggest some irritation or inflammation in your airways. Based on your symptoms and the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing a respiratory infection, potentially bronchitis, made worse by your exposure to dust at work. It's also possible it could be an allergic reaction to something at work, though we don't have enough information to say for sure right now. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a basic blood test. The X-ray will help us rule out any more serious lung issues, and the blood test will check for signs of infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? Uh... is it expensive? I don't have much money. Sorry. And… needles? I don’t like needles. Is there another way? Can I just… take some medicine? Sorry, I really need to get back to work. My wife… she will worry if I’m gone too long. And… I don’t want to spend a lot of money. Is it important?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your worries, Mr. Tati. It's very responsible of you to be concerned about the cost and the discomfort of the tests. The X-ray and blood test will provide us with a more accurate understanding of what’s causing your symptoms, and that will help us determine the best course of treatment. The X-ray costs approximately $150, and the blood test is around $80. We can explore options for financial assistance if needed; the clinic has a program to help patients with limited income. Regarding the needles, the blood test will require a small blood sample, but it’s a quick procedure. I can ensure it’s done as gently and quickly as possible. However, if you are very uncomfortable with the tests at this time, we can start with a course of treatment based on our current assessment. I can prescribe an inhaler to help open your airways and an expectorant to help clear the mucus from your lungs. We can then reassess your condition in a week to see if you’re improving. If you don't see improvement, we can revisit the possibility of the tests then. Would you prefer to try the medication first?
PATIENT: Medication first… yeah. That sounds better. No needles. And… I need to get back to work. My wife… she needs the money. Inhaler and expectorant? Is that expensive? And… will it make me tired? Sorry, I don't want to be too tired to work. I don't want to worry my wife. Just something to make me feel better. Please, just something to make me feel better. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tati. We can definitely start with medication. An inhaler, a bronchodilator called albuterol, will help to open your airways and make it easier to breathe. The expectorant, guaifenesin, will help to loosen the mucus in your lungs so you can cough it up more easily. The inhaler is around $30, and the expectorant is about $15. They shouldn’t cause significant drowsiness, but it’s always possible to experience some mild side effects. If you do experience any side effects, such as dizziness or a rapid heartbeat, please let me know immediately. I’ll write you a prescription for both medications. I also recommend that you try to avoid exposure to dust as much as possible while you are recovering. If possible, wear a mask at work. And be sure to drink plenty of fluids. I want you to follow up with me in one week to see how you are doing. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve, please schedule an appointment sooner. Here’s the prescription. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. Thank you for not making me do the needle test. And thank you for making me feel better. I need to get back to work now. Sorry to take up your time. Thank you again. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tati. I’m glad I could help. Don’t worry about taking up my time – that’s what I’m here for. And remember, if anything changes or you’re not feeling any better, please don’t hesitate to come back. Get well soon, and be careful at work. .
