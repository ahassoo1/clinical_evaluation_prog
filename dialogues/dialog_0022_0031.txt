DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been… not good for a bit now, and I know I have a funny heartbeat sometimes, the doctor told me about that before. I think it’s that, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and you’ve noticed some irregular heartbeats previously diagnosed by another doctor. That's helpful to know. When you say “not good,” can you describe the swelling a little more?
PATIENT: Right. It started… I think maybe a week ago? It’s mostly in my calf, and it feels… tight. Like a big, heavy band around it. And it’s a bit painful when I walk, especially if I’ve been standing for a while. It doesn't hurt all the time, just when I use it. Is that… clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, thank you. So, it started about a week ago, localized to your calf, feels tight like a band, and the pain is exacerbated by walking or standing. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the touch in that area?
PATIENT: Hmm… I haven’t really checked for warmth, to be honest. It doesn't look red, but I haven't been… closely examining it. It looks normal colour, I suppose. It’s just… big. And feels different from my other leg, naturally. Do you need me to check? I can try.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry about forcing a self-exam right now. We can take a look at it together in a moment. And you’re right, a difference compared to your other leg is a good observation. Has anything specific happened that you can think of that might have triggered this—any injury, long flights, or changes in activity level?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been teaching summer classes, so lots of being on my feet, but that’s normal for me. No trips or anything unusual, really. It just… appeared. Which is a bit worrying, if I'm honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nixon. It's good that you're paying attention to changes in your body. It's too early to say definitively whether it's serious, but we'll definitely investigate to find out. To get a better picture, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the funny heartbeat, like I said. The doctor… I think it was Dr. MacLeod… said it was atrial fibrillation. I don’t really understand what that means, but I take some tablets for it. And… I don't have insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of atrial fibrillation managed with medication. Thank you for letting me know. And thank you for mentioning the lack of insurance; that will be something we consider when discussing options. What medication are you currently taking for the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a small, white pill. I get it every month from the pharmacy. The name… oh dear. I’m terrible with names. I believe it begins with a 'B'? Bisoprolol, perhaps? Is that right? I write it down for the box, but I don't memorise them. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Bisoprolol, yes, that sounds right. It's a beta-blocker commonly used for atrial fibrillation. No need to apologize—medication names can be tricky. Now, are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any other known allergies?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. No food allergies, no… anything, as far as I know. My mother always said I was a very hardy child. Is that helpful? It's not a very medical answer, I realise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly helpful, Nixon. It’s good to know you haven’t experienced any allergies. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, blood clots, or swelling in the legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandfather, on my father’s side, had a bad heart. I think he needed an operation, a long time ago. And my aunt… she has terrible varicose veins. Really big ones in her legs. Does that count? I’m not sure if that’s the same as swelling, though. It looks different.
DOCTOR: Yes, both of those are relevant, thank you. A history of heart disease and varicose veins can be important. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't like the smell of it. My parents didn’t smoke, and I’ve always avoided it. I drink tea, sometimes, but nothing else. Does that matter? I suppose it's not a very exciting medical history, is it?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's good to hear you don't smoke, and moderate tea consumption isn't a concern. Now, let's get some physical measurements and do a quick exam of your leg. Would you mind if I checked your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then took a look at your calf?
PATIENT: No, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are. I hope it’s not too serious. It’s just a bit… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6°F. On examination, your left calf does appear noticeably swollen compared to your right. It’s warm to the touch and slightly tender when I press on it. I don’t feel any hard lumps, and I can’t feel a distinct pulse in the foot, although it’s difficult to assess with the swelling. I'll need to listen for a Doppler signal to check the blood flow. The Doppler signal is present but diminished in your left foot compared to your right. This, along with the swelling and tenderness, raises concern for possible deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. We need to rule that out quickly.
PATIENT: DVT? Is that… bad? What does that mean? And what does “rule that out” involve? I’m a bit frightened now, if I'm honest. Is it something I caught? Or is it my heart?
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Nixon, and I apologize for the concerning terminology. DVT stands for deep vein thrombosis. It means a blood clot has formed in a deep vein, usually in your leg. It’s serious because the clot can travel to your lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening. It’s not something you “catch,” like a cold. It's often related to factors like prolonged immobility, injury, surgery, or certain medical conditions—and atrial fibrillation can increase the risk. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s directly related to your heart, but atrial fibrillation can contribute to clot formation. To “rule it out,” we need to get an ultrasound of your left leg. This imaging test can visualize the veins and determine if there’s a clot present. We'll also need to do some blood work to check for elevated D-dimer levels, which can indicate the presence of a clot. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A clot… in my leg. And it could go to my lungs? That sounds… very frightening. An ultrasound and blood work. Is it going to be very expensive? I don't have insurance, as I mentioned. And… how long will it take? Can I still teach my classes? I have students relying on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and your classes, Nixon. It is frightening news, and I want to assure you we’ll work through this. Let's address those questions one at a time. Yes, a clot can travel to your lungs, but it's important not to panic. We are taking steps to find out what's going on and get you the appropriate care. Regarding cost, I’m aware you don’t have insurance. I can discuss options with the clinic’s financial services department to see if we can arrange a payment plan or explore any available assistance programs. We may also be able to negotiate a discounted rate for the tests. We will do our best to minimize the financial burden. As for your classes, that's important. The ultrasound usually takes about 30-45 minutes, and the blood work will be quick. We’ll know the initial results relatively quickly—within a few hours. Depending on the results, we may need to start you on medication immediately, or we might need further investigation. If it is a DVT, you would likely need to refrain from strenuous activity, including teaching, for a period of time, until the clot is managed. I'll need to evaluate you carefully after the tests to give you the best advice on that. Let's get those tests ordered, and then we can discuss a plan. Would you like me to call the radiology department to schedule the ultrasound now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. And thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate you thinking about the cost and my classes. I’m still very frightened, but I feel a little better knowing what’s happening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. It’s my job to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes clear communication and addressing your concerns. I understand your fear, and we’ll get through this together. Okay, I’ve scheduled the ultrasound for this afternoon at 2:30 PM in the radiology department on the third floor. They’ll need your identification and any previous medical records you may have. I’ll also have the lab draw some blood for the D-dimer test before you go to radiology. It’s best to remain relatively still until we have the results. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will I be in radiology? And should I walk, or take a taxi? I live about twenty minutes' walk away. Perhaps it's best to avoid walking, you said something about staying still? I’m just trying to get everything right. I’m a bit flustered, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, you’re not flustered at all. It's good you're thinking ahead. The ultrasound shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes, as I said. And you’re right to ask about walking. Given the concern for a potential DVT, it’s best to avoid strenuous activity, including a 20-minute walk. I recommend taking a taxi or getting a ride to the radiology department. It’s better to be safe than sorry. We’ll have the results back relatively quickly after the ultrasound. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Is that phone number still [Patient phone number]?
