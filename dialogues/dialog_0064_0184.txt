DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day, doctor. I see the advertisement, yeah? About fixin’ how you look. That's what I’m here for. I want somethin' done. Somethin' to make me… less old lookin’. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear, Mr. Trendler. You saw the advertisement for… cosmetic improvements, is that right?
PATIENT: Improvements? That’s a fancy word for fixin’, innit? Look, my skin… it’s saggin’. And I ain't talkin’ about a little bit. It’s like a deflated balloon. And these wrinkles… plenty of 'em. I want 'em gone. You got somethin' that can do that? Don’t tell me 'bout healthy livin’ either. I lived a good life, alright? I just want a fix now. No lectures.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You're looking for options to address sagging skin and wrinkles. No lectures, I promise. We have several possibilities. Before we discuss those, though, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? When didn't I notice changes?! I’m 76 years old, doctor! But serious now… maybe… ten, fifteen years ago I started seein’ it. Not much at first, just little lines 'round me eyes. But it got worse and worse. Especially the last few years. My wife… she used to say I was handsome. But she gone now, so what she say don't matter. But I remember how she used to look at me. And I ain't look like that no more. You understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this has been a gradual process, and it’s natural to want to restore a sense of how you felt before. And it’s perfectly alright to want to feel good about how you look. Now, besides the skin sagging and wrinkles, have you noticed any changes in skin texture, like dryness, or any spots or moles that have changed in size or color?
PATIENT: Dryness? Yeah, always dryness. I use lotion, plenty lotion. Doesn't seem to help much though. And… spots, yes. I got some brown spots on me hands, and me face. Always been there, really. Ain't nothin' new. They haven't gotten bigger, I don't think. I don't pay 'em much mind. I'm more bothered 'bout the saggin'. It makes me look… tired. Old. Like I’m ready for the dirt. Can you fix the saggin', or what? I really don't want to be here all day talkin' 'bout spots.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We can definitely focus on the sagging. Just to get a complete picture, I'd like to quickly review your medical history in our system. Do you mind if I pull up your records?
PATIENT: Records? I been to a doctor maybe twice in the last twenty years. And that was for a bad back when I was still workin’ with the pile driver. I doubt you got nothin' on me. But go ahead, waste your time. I'm sittin' here. Just don't expect to find a whole lot. And hurry up, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: You are right, Mr. Trendler. It appears there’s very limited information in the system. Just a brief note about a back injury from 2003. That’s fine. We can certainly proceed without a detailed history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just some vitamins. Old people take vitamins, innit? Fish oil, Vitamin D… the usual. And sometimes I take somethin' for me arthritis, when it’s bad. But not every day. Mostly just when the weather change. Don't think that matters, though. I ain’t sick. I just want me face fixed. Are we gettin' anywhere, or are you just askin' questions all day? I could be home relaxin’ right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, we're getting there. So, vitamins, fish oil, and occasional medication for arthritis. No allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never had 'em. I eat anything. Never been picky. Dust bothers me a little, maybe. But everyone coughs in dust, innit? I ain't breakin' out in hives or nothin'. Look, doctor, I'm tellin' you, I'm a simple man. I want to look less old. That's it. What can you do about the saggin'? Before I lose me patience completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. Regarding the sagging skin, there are several options we can consider. These include procedures like a facelift, which tightens the underlying muscle and skin, or less invasive treatments like skin tightening with radiofrequency or ultrasound. We also have injectable fillers that can restore volume and improve the appearance of sagging. To determine the best approach, I’d like to examine your skin more closely. Would you mind if I take a look?
PATIENT: Examine? You mean… touch me face? I don't know, doctor… I ain't real comfortable with people touchin’ me face. You gotta tell me what you’re lookin’ for, alright? And don’t go pokin’ around too much. Just a quick look, yeah? And tell me what all these fancy words mean. Facelift? Radio… what? I don’t want no radio stuff on me face! Just tell me in plain English. Can you fix it, or can’t you? That's all I want to know. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Absolutely. No poking around, I promise. And I will explain everything in plain English. A facelift, as the name suggests, involves surgically lifting and tightening the skin on your face and neck to reduce sagging and wrinkles. It’s a more involved procedure, with a longer recovery time. The other options – radiofrequency and ultrasound – use energy waves to stimulate collagen production, which helps to tighten the skin without surgery. It’s less invasive, with less downtime, but the results are typically more subtle. To give you a better idea of what might be suitable, could I just take a quick look at your skin?
