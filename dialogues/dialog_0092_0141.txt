DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just…annoying, to be honest. Not painful, just constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: I see. Itching can certainly be bothersome. When you say “a little while,” could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…probably around the end of May, maybe the first week of June. So, about six, seven weeks now? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tickle here and there, but it’s definitely gotten worse over the last couple of weeks. I remember because my granddaughter came to visit then, and I noticed it more when I was trying to play with her.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven weeks. And it’s been gradually worsening. You mentioned it's everywhere – does that mean it’s all over your body, or are there specific areas that are more affected than others?
PATIENT: It is pretty much everywhere, Doctor. But…if I had to pick, it's worse on my arms and back. My legs are itchy too, but not as bad. And it’s on my chest, a bit on my stomach…even my scalp feels a little prickly sometimes. It's hard to scratch everywhere at once, you know? It's just…constant.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant itching can be very disruptive. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm…nothing really makes it better, to be honest. But hot showers seem to make it worse for a little while afterwards. And if I get really stressed, it flares up too. Like, last week I was dealing with a problem at the dispatch center – a big mix-up with a transport schedule – and I was really itchy all evening.
DOCTOR: Okay, hot showers exacerbate it, and stress seems to be a trigger. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies, like lotions or creams?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I tried some of that hydrocortisone cream, the one you rub on for rashes. Didn’t really do much, to be honest. And I used some of that calamine lotion, but that just felt…sticky. It helped for a minute, maybe, but then it was back to itching. It’s why I figured I should come see a doctor. It's just not going away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itching?
PATIENT: Let me think…no, not really. It doesn’t look different, Doctor. No rash, no bumps, no redness…just itchy. Sometimes it feels a little dry, but I put lotion on anyway, you know, to try and help with the itching. Oh, actually…now that you mention it, my skin has felt a little warmer than usual lately, but I figured that was just the summer heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible rash, bumps, or redness, just the sensation of warmth and itching. That’s good information. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for about five years now. Other than that…not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I take a little something for my cholesterol, but that’s it. Oh! And my doctor told me I was a little anemic a couple of years ago, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much. He just told me to eat more iron-rich foods.
DOCTOR: Okay, so controlled hypertension, past appendectomy, mild anemia, and medication for cholesterol. What medications are you currently taking for your cholesterol, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me see…I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here we go. It’s…atorvastatin. 20 milligrams, once a day. And like I said, the other one for the blood pressure is lisinopril, 10 milligrams. I’ve been on both for quite some time now.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with bee stings or anything like that. My wife…God rest her soul…she was the one with all the allergies. Pollen, dust, cats…everything! I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm…family history. My mother had…arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands, towards the end. And my father…he had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. My sister…she’s healthy as a horse, always been very active. And my wife’s family…her mother had diabetes, and her father had some kind of…skin condition, I think. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. It’s hard to remember everything, you know? It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: I understand. That gives me a good starting point. Finally, a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife always said it was a terrible habit, and I didn't want to disappoint her. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had much since she passed away. And I definitely don’t do any…recreational drugs. Dispatch work is stressful enough as it is without adding anything else to it. I mostly just drink tea, to be honest. Earl Grey, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Thank you for answering all of those questions so thoroughly. Now, I would like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your skin to assess the areas of itching. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m ready when you are. It’s probably just something simple, hopefully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be great. Heart rate is regular at 72 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Skin is warm to the touch. No visible rash, lesions, or signs of excoriation are noted at this time. There's some mild dryness on his forearms, but nothing significant. I’m also going to check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. Okay. Everything seems normal so far, but the persistent itching warrants further investigation. We'll need to get some blood work done. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us rule out some of the more common causes of generalized itching. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It's really starting to bother me, and I'd like to know what's causing it. And...where do I go to get the blood work done? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can draw the blood right here at the clinic. I’ll write you a lab requisition. Just take this to the lab down the hall, and they’ll take care of it. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. They’ll let you know when the results are available, usually within 24-48 hours. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin, and try to avoid hot showers as much as possible. I can also prescribe a topical anti-itch cream with a slightly stronger medication than what you’ve already tried, which might provide some temporary relief. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. Anything to help with the itching. It’s just…constant, you know? And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. And yes, the cream would be great. Thank you again. Hopefully it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I understand how frustrating constant itching can be. I’m going to write you a prescription for triamcinolone 0.1% cream. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily. Here’s the prescription. I will also give you a printout explaining the common side effects of the cream, and what to do if you experience any. It is important to use it as directed, and don’t apply it to broken skin. Are there any questions you have for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough. Just…thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out what’s going on. I'll get the blood work done right away and schedule a follow-up when the results are back. And thank you again for the cream. I'm hoping it'll give me a little bit of relief. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to support you. You have a good day as well. And please, try to get some rest.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. .
