DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It is nice to meet you too. Dr. Shely, you said? Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. My family… we’ve always had bad headaches. It's mostly on my right side, I think. Though, honestly, it all feels a little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly alright if things are a bit fuzzy; we’ll take our time and get to the bottom of it. Your daughter did mention weakness and headaches. To help me understand better, could you tell me a little more about the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, well… they come and go. Not every day, thankfully. When they do come, it’s usually… a throbbing. A really bad throbbing on the right side of my head. Sometimes it feels like… pressure, more than pain. And… lights bother me when I have one. Bright lights, especially. Used to be able to handle anything, but now… oh dear. It's hard to remember exactly when they started getting worse. A few years, maybe? It's all blending together, you know? My sister, she had terrible migraines too. Real debilitating ones.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like these headaches have been a recurring issue for some time, and it’s helpful to know about your sister’s history. The throbbing sensation, the sensitivity to light, and the location on the right side are all important details. You mentioned the weakness – can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the weakness… that’s the trickiest part. It's not… constant. Comes and goes, like the headaches. It feels like… my right arm and leg just get heavy. Like I’m trying to lift something really, really big, even when I’m not. It’s mostly on my right side, naturally. It doesn’t happen all the time, and sometimes it’s just a little bit… clumsy, you know? I haven’t fallen or anything, but… I worry. My daughter says I should get it checked out, and she’s probably right. It's just... hard to explain how it feels. It’s like my body doesn’t always listen to me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Ms. Tofani. It sounds concerning that the weakness is intermittent and on the same side as your headaches. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Regular check-ups, you know. Had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was… a long time ago. No major illnesses, thankfully. I take a little medication for my blood pressure, but nothing fancy. Dr. Rossi, he used to be my doctor, he prescribed it. He retired, bless his heart. I… I think that’s about it. I’ve never been one for a lot of ailments. My husband, now he had a bad knee, but… oh dear, I’m probably forgetting something important. It's so frustrating when your mind doesn’t work like it used to.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. It’s common to forget things, and we have your records to help us. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the blood pressure medication is helpful. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, now that’s a good question. Let me see… it’s a little white pill, I think. Small, little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. The name… hmm. I want to say… Lisinopril? Is that right? Or was it Losartan? Oh, dear. They both sound so similar. I always just ask my daughter to refill it, I don’t bother trying to remember the name. She’s very good with these things. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. Lisinopril is a common medication for blood pressure, and that aligns with what we have on record. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Never been allergic to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. Though… I did get a bit of a rash once, a long time ago, from some kind of lotion. But it went away on its own, so I just stopped using it. Nothing serious, nothing that needed a doctor. I’m pretty lucky, really. My daughter is the one with all the allergies, poor thing. She has to be so careful about what she eats.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Tofani. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a long story. My mother… she had heart trouble. Needed a pacemaker, bless her heart. And like I said, my sister had terrible migraines. Just awful. My father… he had diabetes, I think. He was always tired. And… oh dear, there was an uncle, on my husband's side, who had… something with his brain? A stroke, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. We were young, and nobody talked about these things much back then. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Is that helpful? I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Tofani. Knowing about the heart trouble, migraines, diabetes, and the potential stroke provides valuable information. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history… well, I’m retired now. Used to work in an insurance office, processing claims and policies. It was… busy. I’ve been married to my husband, Frank, for… oh goodness, 62 years now! We have two grown children, and four grandchildren. We mostly stay home now. We enjoy gardening, and watching television. Frank likes to read, and I… I like to cook. We don’t go out much anymore. It’s just… easier this way. I used to enjoy dancing, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I don’t drink alcohol, and I don’t smoke. Have never smoked a day in my life. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Ms. Tofani. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’ve had a full and happy life, and that’s wonderful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to quickly confirm: Have you experienced any fever, vision changes, difficulty speaking, or any recent injuries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No fever, thankfully. My vision is… well, it’s not perfect, I wear glasses, as you can see. But no changes in my vision. No difficulty speaking, no. And no recent injuries, no falls or anything like that. I haven't been sick with anything in… well, I can't even remember the last time I had a cold! Just these headaches, and the weakness. That’s all. I'm getting a little worried now, to be honest. All these questions… it makes it sound more serious than I thought. Is something wrong, dear?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel worried, Ms. Tofani. I’m asking these questions to get a comprehensive understanding of your health, and it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something serious wrong. However, given your symptoms – the headaches, weakness, and family history – it’s important to investigate further. I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam now, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological assessment to check your reflexes and coordination. It won't take long, and it will help me determine the best course of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it’s best. My daughter always says I should listen to the doctors. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I don’t want to be a bother. And I don’t want to spend my golden years worrying about my health. But… yes, alright. Go ahead with the exam. Just… be gentle, please. And let me know if you find anything concerning. I trust your judgment, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/86, which we can discuss later. Your pulse is regular at 72, and your temperature is normal. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This may feel a little strange. Okay. Your reflexes are a bit diminished on your right side compared to your left. Now, could you please touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger, alternating hands?
PATIENT: Oh… this is harder than it looks. There… is something… off. My right arm… it feels… heavy. And it’s… shaking a little. I haven't felt this clumsy in years. Is that… bad? My daughter always said I was coordinated. She used to say I was a good dancer. But… oh dear. I’m probably making a mess of things. Is that what you're looking for? Is it that obvious?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Tofani. You’re not making a mess of things at all. It’s helpful for me to see how your body moves. I am noticing some slight difficulty with coordination on your right side, and a mild tremor, as you’ve noticed. It's subtle, but it's worth investigating further. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh… this is harder than it looks too. I'm trying, dear, but it doesn’t feel like I have much strength. My right hand… it just feels… tired. And a little numb, maybe? It’s hard to say. I used to be able to open jars with no problem, but now… oh dear. I'm probably just getting old, aren’t I? Is that what’s happening? Everything just… gets weaker. Is there anything you can do about it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. I do notice some weakness in your right hand compared to your left. The numbness you're describing is also concerning. While it’s natural for strength to decline with age, the combination of weakness, numbness, coordination difficulties, and the diminished reflex warrants further investigation. Based on my examination, I’m concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue. It could be something relatively minor, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. I recommend ordering a brain MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… a brain MRI? Oh dear. That sounds… scary. What are you looking for, dear? Is it… is it something bad? My husband, Frank, he had an MRI once, and it wasn’t a pleasant experience. He said it was noisy, and he felt claustrophobic. I… I don’t do well with small spaces. But… If you think it’s necessary, then alright. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then I suppose I can do it. But… please, be gentle. And explain everything to me. I just… I don’t want any surprises. And… is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. An MRI can be unsettling, but it’s a very safe and effective way to get a detailed look at your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it's painless. The MRI will help us rule out several possibilities, such as a stroke, a tumor, or other structural issues that could be causing your symptoms. It's important to remember that most of the time, these symptoms are caused by something relatively minor, but we need to get a clear picture to be sure. The machine is a large, open tube, and it can be noisy, as you mentioned. We can provide you with earplugs or headphones to help with the noise. If you're prone to claustrophobia, we can offer a mild sedative to help you relax during the scan. The scan itself takes about 30-45 minutes. We'll have a technician stay with you throughout the entire process, and you'll be able to communicate with them if you feel uncomfortable at any time. Would you like me to schedule the MRI for you today?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. If you think it’s best. And if you’ll be there, and you’ll explain everything… then yes, go ahead and schedule it. But please… make sure it’s as quick as possible. And give me the earplugs. And… maybe the sedative. Just a little one. I don’t want to be… out of it, but I don’t want to panic either. What do I need to do to prepare? Should I remove my jewelry? Do I need to fast? Oh dear, I always forget everything. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll try my best. I trust you, dear. Just… please, be gentle. And let me know what you find. I just want to get back to my normal life, you know? Gardening, cooking… spending time with Frank. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tofani. I completely understand. We'll make sure everything is as comfortable as possible for you. For the MRI, you can leave your jewelry on, but please remove any metal objects, such as hearing aids or dentures. You don't need to fast, and you can take your medications as usual. Please wear comfortable clothing, and arrive about 15 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. I’ll order a mild sedative to help you relax, but it won’t completely knock you out. You’ll still be awake and aware of your surroundings, but you’ll feel more calm and less anxious. I've scheduled the MRI for you on August 9th at 10:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. The technician will explain the procedure in detail before the scan, and I’ll be available to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as a sudden headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything so clearly. Thank you… thank you for listening. And for being so patient with me. I… I get so flustered sometimes. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. But I appreciate your kindness. I suppose I’ll go home now and… try to relax. And I’ll make sure Frank knows about the appointment. He always worries about me. Thank you again, dear. You’re a very kind doctor. And… please, be gentle. With the MRI, and with everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t worry, we'll take excellent care of you. We’ll make sure everything is as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And please, try to relax and take care of yourself.
