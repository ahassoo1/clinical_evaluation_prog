DOCTOR: Hello, Philipp. Welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um, my heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but… yeah. It’s been happening a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, "funny"… can you tell me a little more about that flapping feeling?
PATIENT: It’s… fast. Like it’s beating too fast. And sometimes… it feels like it skips a beat. Not every beat, but… some. It doesn't hurt, just… strange. And makes me a little tired, maybe? I don't know. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a fast heartbeat, sometimes skipping, and perhaps some tiredness. How long has this been going on for, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three months? Four? It started slow, just once in a while. Now it's maybe… two or three times a week? Not all day, just for a little bit each time. Maybe five minutes? Ten? It goes away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, increasing to a few times a week, lasting a few minutes each time. And it resolves on its own. Do you notice anything specifically that triggers it?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't think so. I've been working… same job, same everything. Sometimes when I walk up hills… but I walk up hills all the time. It’s just… random. No big stress, no… nothing different, really. I eat normal food, sleep normal hours. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, no obvious triggers. And you said "normal" – can you tell me a little bit about what a typical day's food intake looks like for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Breakfast… usually bread with some cheese. Sometimes eggs. Lunch is… rice and meat, usually chicken. My wife cooks. Dinner… same kind of thing. Rice, meat, maybe some vegetables. We drink tea, lots of tea. Not much sugar. I don't drink coffee. And… I like sweets sometimes, but not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, sounds like a fairly standard diet. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had any problems with anything like that. I can eat anything. I've tried lots of things. My wife likes to cook different foods from Yemen, and I eat everything she makes!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills if I don't need them. I try to stay healthy. My wife… she sometimes takes something for her headaches, but not me. Just tea. Lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've been lucky, I think. I've had colds, like everyone, but… never anything serious. I went to the doctor when my arm hurt once, but it was just a muscle. Never had any problems with my heart before. My wife… she has headaches a lot, but not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My father… he had some problems with his legs when he got old. But not heart problems. My mother… she was healthy, mostly. She had a cold sometimes, but nothing bad. My wife's mother… she had… I don't know the English word… problems with her sugar. Diabetes, maybe? But no one… no one in my family had a heart problem like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of heart problems. That's helpful. Now, just to get a better picture, do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't like smoking. It smells bad, and it's not healthy. My wife doesn’t smoke either. We both like fresh air.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, one last question before we do a quick examination. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Sometimes… at weddings, maybe a small glass of something. But not often. I don’t drink alcohol every day, or even every month. My wife… she doesn't drink either. It’s not part of our life, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular alcohol consumption. Thank you for answering all those questions, Philipp. It gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. …Okay, blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, let’s listen to your heart. …Okay. I do hear a slight irregularity in your heartbeat. It’s not a strong irregularity, but it’s there. And your pulse is a little fast – around 90 beats per minute. …And I’ll listen to your lungs. …Your lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: Okay… irregular heartbeat… fast pulse… What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking, Philipp. An irregular heartbeat, what we call an arrhythmia, and a slightly elevated pulse can be concerning, but it doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It could be caused by a number of things – stress, caffeine, dehydration, or sometimes just normal variations. But it’s important to investigate further to rule out anything more serious. Given your symptoms and what I’m hearing, I’d like to order a few tests. First, an electrocardiogram, or EKG, which records the electrical activity of your heart. That will give us a more detailed picture of the irregularity. And I’d also like to do some blood work – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – to check your overall health and rule out any other contributing factors. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: EKG… blood work… Okay. That sounds… okay. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? And… how much will it cost? I don't have insurance, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Philipp. The EKG is completely painless. We just place some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It takes about five minutes. The blood work involves a small needle prick, so it will be a little uncomfortable, but it's very quick. As for the cost… I understand you don’t have insurance, and that’s a concern. Let me check the pricing for you. …Okay, the EKG will be about $75, and the blood work is around $120. I know that’s not ideal, but it's important to get these tests done to understand what’s going on. We can also talk about payment options if that’s a problem. The clinic sometimes has assistance programs for patients without insurance. Would you like me to look into that for you?
PATIENT: $75… $120… That's a lot. But… I guess I need to know what’s wrong, right? Yes, please, Doctor. Check about the assistance programs. If there's any way to make it cheaper… that would be very helpful. I work hard, but… money is tight.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Philipp. Let me see what I can find. Okay, good news. It looks like we do have a program that can help reduce the cost of the tests for patients with limited income. With the assistance, the EKG will be about $30, and the blood work will be around $50. Is that more manageable?
PATIENT: $30… $50… Yes! That’s much better, Doctor. Thank you. That’s… I can manage that. Okay. Let’s do it. When can I have the tests?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab technician is available right away. We can do the EKG and blood work now, if you’re comfortable. It will probably take about half an hour to an hour total. After the tests are done, the results will be sent to me, and I will review them and contact you to discuss the findings and plan next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Let’s do it now, then. I want to know what’s wrong, so I can… I don’t know… feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Wonderful. Let’s go. I’ll walk you over to the lab, and I’ll explain the procedure to the technician. Just relax, and we’ll get this done.
