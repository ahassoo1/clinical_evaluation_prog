DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Results, you said? Look, I'm pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great. I remember scheduling this specifically to hear what those tests showed.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. My apologies. Sometimes the details…escape me. Let’s see… August 2nd, 2025… Ms. Kovtun, you had some blood work and a urine analysis completed on July 15th. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds right. July 15th. I needed to rule a few things out, and that’s what they told me to do. So… what did they find? Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Well, the complete blood count was largely within normal limits. Your white blood cell count was slightly elevated, but not drastically so. The urine analysis showed a trace amount of protein, which can be common and often isn’t cause for significant concern. However…there was also a small presence of ketones. Do you have any idea why that might be?
PATIENT: Ketones? Honestly, no. I don’t really follow all that stuff. I just…felt tired a lot, and the doctor back home thought I should get it checked. Is that bad? Like, seriously bad? I skipped breakfast a couple of times last week, does that have anything to do with it?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious bad, Ms. Kovtun, but it does warrant a little further investigation. Ketones are produced when your body starts burning fat for energy instead of glucose. Skipping meals can certainly contribute to that, as can dehydration or…other factors. To get a clearer picture, could you describe your typical diet for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Okay, look, I mostly eat what I can get. I work logistics, right? So, I’m on the road a lot. When I’m staying in hotels, I usually grab something quick – sandwiches, salads, sometimes fast food if there’s nothing else. When I’m camping, it’s… granola bars, dried fruit, trail mix, that sort of thing. I drink a lot of water, usually. And coffee. Lots of coffee. I guess I don’t really plan meals, if that makes sense. Just…fuel. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It sounds like your diet is…variable. And the coffee is good for alertness, but can also contribute to dehydration. Ms. Kovtun, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that you mention it… my clothes have been a little looser. I hadn’t really paid attention, honestly. I figured it was just the heat. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, though. Definitely not. I just…haven’t been eating as much, maybe? It’s hard to keep track when you’re constantly moving. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Kovtun. Unintentional weight loss, even a small amount, alongside the ketones and variable diet, raises a few possibilities. Have you noticed any increased thirst, frequent urination, or blurred vision?
PATIENT: Okay, now you’re starting to scare me a little. Increased thirst… yeah, actually. I’ve been going through water bottles like crazy. And I think… my vision has been a little fuzzy sometimes, especially when I’m driving. I just thought it was fatigue. Frequent urination… yeah, I guess so. I’ve been stopping more often on the road, but I figured that was just the water! What’s going on? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, based on what you've told me – the increased thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, unintentional weight loss, and the presence of ketones – it’s important to consider the possibility of diabetes. I don’t want to alarm you, but these are classic symptoms. We need to run some further tests to confirm this, including a fasting blood glucose test and potentially an A1C test. I'm going to order those tests for you right away. Would you be able to come back in a few days for a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Diabetes?! Seriously? Oh, man. I… that runs in my family, actually. My grandmother had it. Okay, tests, fine. Whatever it takes. A few days? Yeah, I can make that work. I need to know, right? What happens if it is diabetes? Will I… will I have to change everything? I just got this logistics route, and… this is bad timing. What kind of changes are we talking about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the family history, Ms. Kovtun. That does increase your risk. And yes, discovering it now is the best possible outcome. If it is diabetes, it doesn't necessarily mean drastic changes immediately. There are different types and different levels of severity. We would start with lifestyle modifications – dietary changes, regular exercise – and potentially medication depending on the results of the tests. We'll work with you to create a plan that fits your lifestyle. It will require some adjustments, yes, especially given your work schedule, but it's very manageable. We can also connect you with a diabetes educator who can provide support and guidance. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I’m going to write you a lab order, and the front desk can help you schedule the appointment. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. Lifestyle changes… I can try. I mean, I guess I'll have to. A diabetes educator? That sounds… helpful, actually. I don't even know where to start with all of this. Will the tests take long? And… can I still work while I’m waiting for the results? I really need this job. I have bills to pay. And… is it contagious? Sorry, that probably sounds stupid. Just… trying to cover all the bases.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Ms. Kovtun. Absolutely. The blood tests themselves are fairly quick – usually about ten minutes for the draw. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. As for work, yes, you can absolutely continue working while we await the results. It's important to maintain your routine as much as possible. And no, diabetes is not contagious. It's not caused by a virus or bacteria. It’s related to how your body processes sugar. Here is the order for the lab tests. The front desk will help you schedule an appointment, and they can answer any logistical questions you have. I want you to try not to worry too much at this point. We are going to figure this out, together. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to know. “Figure it out, together.” I like that. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… getting the tests done. And not freaking out. Easier said than done, I guess. Thanks, Dr. Pirl. You've been… helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything. I should probably get this scheduled and get back on the road. Time is money, right? .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kovtun. I understand the importance of time. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’re here to support you. Take care, and safe travels. .
