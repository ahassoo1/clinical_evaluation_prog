DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my chest… it hurts a little. Not all the time, but sometimes it does. It's… hard to explain. It’s not like a bad pain, more… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “uncomfortable” is a good way to start. Can you tell me a little more about that discomfort?
PATIENT: Well… it’s mostly on this side. Not like, a sharp pain, like if someone hit me. More like… a dull ache? And sometimes it feels… full? I don’t know if that makes sense. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, though. Just… feels weird.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Bulaong. A dull ache and a feeling of fullness… alright. And when did you first notice this discomfort?
PATIENT: Um… maybe a week ago? I think so. It started… after I was doing some work on a roof. It wasn't a really hard job, but… you know, lots of reaching and lifting. It came on slow, not all at once. I thought maybe I just pulled something, but it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago after some work on a roof involving reaching and lifting. That's helpful information. Does anything specific make the discomfort better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think anything makes it better, really. It just… is. But… when I’m using my arms a lot, like… working, it feels a little more sore, maybe? Like when I’m lifting stuff. And… when I’m resting it’s not so bad. Not gone, but… less. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it seems to be exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all alongside this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing else. No fever, no… bumps or anything. Just the ache. And sometimes that full feeling. My wife hasn't noticed anything weird either, and she usually notices everything!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and it's helpful that your wife hasn't noticed anything different. Alright, Mr. Bulaong. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your general health. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just the usual colds and flus. I work hard, eat okay, try to sleep enough. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything, even if it wasn't serious?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. And like I said, no hospital visits. Just… a few stitches when I was a kid, falling off my bike. Nothing major. My wife always says I'm too stubborn to go to the doctor unless something's really bad.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good you've been generally healthy. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandpa, on my mom’s side, he had… something with his heart, I think. But I don’t know exactly what. He passed away a long time ago. And my aunt, she had cancer, but that was a long time ago too. My mom says nobody else had anything too serious. It's hard to remember everything, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Knowing about your grandpa's heart condition and your aunt's cancer is helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but that's not an allergy, just… a preference. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just water, mostly. And sometimes coffee to keep me going on the roof. My wife says I drink too much coffee, but it helps me work!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… um… I work, mostly. I’m a roofer, like I said. It’s hard work, lots of physical activity. I try to get eight hours of sleep when I can, but sometimes it's hard after a long day. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy. Pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your chest to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me if it hurts or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bulaong. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take nice, slow breaths for me. Okay. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s quite faint, but it’s there. And I’m just feeling your chest wall now… No tenderness to palpation. You don’t flinch or pull away when I press. Alright. Your chest wall feels normal. I’m noting the slight murmur on auscultation and no tenderness to palpation. I’d like to get a few more details before we decide on the next steps. Is there any family history of heart murmurs?
PATIENT: A heart murmur? I don't think so… my wife might know. She’s really good with remembering things like that. Nobody ever talked about it, if there was one. I don’t think so, but I’ll ask her when I get home. She knows all the family history, she really does.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Since the murmur is faint and you're experiencing chest discomfort after physical activity, I’d like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be okay with an EKG and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: An EKG and… an X-ray? What will those do? I’m okay with it, I guess, if you think it's necessary. Just… what are you looking for? I don’t want anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a quick and painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It can help us identify any irregular heartbeats or signs of damage. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart, looking for any abnormalities. We're looking to rule out any heart-related issues as a cause of your chest discomfort and investigate the murmur. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. The clinic does charge a small fee for these tests, but since you are uninsured we can discuss some assistance programs that might be available to help with the cost. Would you like me to go over those options with you?
PATIENT: Uninsured… yes. That’s… difficult. Assistance programs? That would be good. Anything to help. I just want to know what's going on. I need to work, you know? So, the tests will tell you if my heart is okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bulaong, I understand. We'll definitely explore those assistance programs. Let me get the information for you. Here's a list of programs that may be able to help cover the cost of the EKG and chest X-ray. You can apply online or call these numbers to learn more about the requirements and application process. As for the tests, they will help us assess your heart's health. The EKG will identify any rhythm issues or signs of prior heart attack, and the chest X-ray will show us the size and shape of your heart and lungs. We can also look for fluid buildup or other problems. If the tests come back abnormal, we might need to consider a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for further evaluation. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll start with these tests and go from there. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves or the assistance programs?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot of information. I think I understand. Assistance programs… I’ll have to call those later. And the tests… yes. Just let me know what happens. I trust you, Doctor. When can I do the tests? I can work around my schedule.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Bulaong. We can get those tests done today, if you're able. The technician is available this afternoon. Would 2:00 PM work for you?
PATIENT: 2:00 PM sounds good. Yes, that works. Okay. So, 2:00 PM today. I'll go to… where do I go? Do I need to do anything special before the tests? Eat something? Not eat something?
DOCTOR: Great. 2:00 PM it is. You'll go to the Radiology Department, which is just down the hall to your left, and check in at the front desk. They'll get you set up. As for the tests, you don't need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally before the EKG and chest X-ray. Just wear comfortable clothing—nothing with metal on it, as that can interfere with the X-ray. Do you have any metal on you now, like a belt buckle or jewelry?
PATIENT: My belt… yes. And a watch. I’ll take those off before I go. Okay. Belt and watch off. Anything else? Is there anything I need to tell the technician? Like about the pain? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Just let the technician know about the chest discomfort you've been experiencing, and that we're investigating a slight heart murmur. They will record that information as well. I’ll have the nurse give you a written order for the tests to take with you. Do you have any other questions for me before you head over?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what’s going on. I’ll see you later, then, after the tests.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. The nurse will be right in with that order. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. We’ll get these tests done and figure out what’s going on. I’ll see you after your appointment. Take care.
PATIENT: .
