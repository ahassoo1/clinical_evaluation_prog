DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... flushing. I get very red, you see. My face, mostly. And sometimes my neck. It happens now and then. Not all the time, thankfully. It's just... bothersome.
DOCTOR: Flushing, you say. And it's primarily on your face and neck. "Now and then"… can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. It's hard to say exactly. Sometimes after I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always. And sometimes… just when I'm talking to people. Not everyone, though. Just… some people. I don't know why. It just… comes on. It's been happening for a few months, I think. Maybe six? It's hard to remember exactly. But not years. Definitely not years.
DOCTOR: So, it seems to be triggered by spicy foods sometimes, and also… social situations with certain individuals. Six months, you said. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Better? Let me think... Usually, it just goes away on its own. After a bit. If I go somewhere quiet, maybe. Or if the person… stops talking to me! No, that's rude. But… yeah. Quiet and alone. That helps. And cold water on my face. That feels good for a little bit, anyway. But it comes back.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it resolves spontaneously, quiet and solitude help, and cold water offers temporary relief. Hmm. And you mentioned it happens with some people… can you describe those people, or the situations when it happens with them?
PATIENT: Oh, that's tricky. They're usually… people in charge, I guess. Like, my landlord. Or someone giving me directions. Someone telling me what to do. Not always, you understand. Just… sometimes. And if I'm trying to explain something, and they don't seem to understand. Then I get… red. I don't mean to. It's just… it happens. It makes me feel very… silly.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it seems to be associated with feelings of… being directed, or perhaps, challenged?
PATIENT: Challenged… yes, maybe that’s it. Or… like I have to prove something. I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. And then my face gets hot. It’s very embarrassing. I used to be good at talking. Now… I worry about it happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. It sounds like you’re experiencing quite a bit of anxiety around this, and understandably so. We need to rule out some physical causes first, though. Let's start with a basic physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. Then, I’d like to ask about your medical history—any other conditions you have, medications you're taking, family history... the usual. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Blood pressure, okay. I don't have any other conditions, not that I know of. I don’t take any pills. My wife… she used to handle all that. But she… passed away last year. I haven’t really seen a doctor since then. Family… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had a bad heart. But that was a long time ago. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. We'll note the family history of hypertension and heart disease. Before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. My wife always said I had a cast iron stomach. She liked to cook spicy food, you see. That's probably why I get red sometimes. She'd laugh. She always laughed. Sorry. I’m rambling. No allergies. Definitely none.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s get this examination done, then. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your skin. Just relax.
PATIENT: Okay. The table… is it cold? My wife always said doctors’ offices were too cold. I'll try to relax. Just tell me if it's going to be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be uncomfortable, Mr. Withycombe. Just routine. Now, if you could please take a deep breath… Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs noted. Now, lungs… take another deep breath for me… Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. Skin… Mild facial erythema present, as described. No rashes or lesions noted. Alright. Everything seems physically normal, though your blood pressure is a bit high. It could be stress. Now, can you tell me about your diet and exercise habits?
PATIENT: Diet… I eat mostly what I can find at the store. Soup, sometimes. Sandwiches. Not much cooking anymore. And exercise… I used to walk a lot with my wife. But now… not so much. I sit a lot. Watching television. Reading. It’s not very good, I know. I should walk more. She always said walking was good for the soul.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a fairly sedentary lifestyle and a diet that could use some improvement. Mr. Withycombe, what I’m hearing suggests a possible link between your lifestyle, your blood pressure, and these flushing episodes. It’s possible that this is simply a manifestation of anxiety and stress, coupled with poor circulation. However, we can’t rule out other possibilities entirely. We should run some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I strongly recommend you consider lifestyle changes—diet, exercise, stress management. Perhaps a referral to a therapist might also be beneficial. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. I don’t like needles. But if you think it’s important… okay. And a therapist… I don’t know. I’ve never talked to anyone about… things. But… maybe. If it helps. So, blood tests and… talking. Is that expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. Everything is… difficult now.
DOCTOR: The cost will depend on the specific tests and the therapist's fees. I can write you a referral for blood work at a reasonably priced lab, and I have a list of therapists who offer sliding scale fees based on income. We'll start with the blood tests, and then we can discuss the therapy option further, depending on the results. Let me get the lab order written up for you. I’ll need to collect a small blood sample for a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. These will help rule out anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and thyroid issues. We’ll get those results back in a few days. In the meantime, try to reduce your stress levels and incorporate some light exercise into your routine, if possible. Here you are. Take this to the lab. They’ll schedule an appointment for you. We’ll review the results when they come back. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Light exercise… that sounds good. I’ll try. And thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I’ll see you when the results are back. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Withycombe. You take care now. We’ll see you then. .
