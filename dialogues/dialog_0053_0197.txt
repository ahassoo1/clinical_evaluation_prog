DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just need to get that card for driving, the one for ride-sharing. You know, for doing deliveries and such. Hopefully this won’t take too long, I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Right. A medical card for ride-sharing… I see. While I understand you're busy, Ms. Sciarrotta, this isn’t quite a 'quick' process. These cards require a fairly thorough assessment to ensure you meet the necessary health standards for commercial driving. It's not simply a matter of signing off on something. It's for your safety, and the safety of others. Before we proceed, let’s just clarify – are you experiencing any health issues currently that might affect your ability to drive safely?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. Safety first, absolutely. No, nothing like that. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but physical therapy sorted that out nicely. Honestly, I feel better now than I did ten years ago. Just…getting older, you know? But my driving is good. Really good. I’ve been driving since I was…well, a long time ago. Is there a form I need to fill out? Or do you want to just ask me questions? Either way is fine with me.
DOCTOR: "A 'bit of trouble' with your knees…and 'getting older.' Right. We'll need to be more specific than that, Ms. Sciarrotta. While I appreciate your… enthusiasm, this isn’t about whether you feel good. It’s about ensuring there aren’t any underlying conditions. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if you think it's minor?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. The knees, like I said, arthritis, but it’s managed. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the medication keeps it under control now. And… oh! I had my gallbladder removed, about twenty years ago. Everything went smoothly. Other than that, not much. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age. I go to my regular check-ups, you can call my doctor if you need to. He’s Dr. Tanaka, over on Elm Street. He’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: "Arthritis, hypertension, cholecystectomy… Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or anything else, Ms. Sciarrotta?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take Lisinopril for the blood pressure – ten milligrams, once a day. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take Ibuprofen, just the over-the-counter kind. Not every day, mind you, only when I really need it. Usually after a long drive. Is that alright? Should I tell you everything I take, even vitamins? I have a few of those.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sciarrotta, you should tell me everything you take. Even the vitamins. It's all relevant. We need a complete picture here. Ibuprofen use, even intermittently, can have implications, as can certain vitamins. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Definitely not. No diabetes in the family, thankfully. My heart is fine, I had a check-up just last year and it was all good. No strokes, no neurological anything. I might forget where I put my keys sometimes, but that’s just getting old, not a neurological condition! Honestly, I feel very healthy for my age. But I understand you have to ask all these questions. It’s your job. Should I list all my vitamins now? I have Vitamin D, calcium…the usual.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do list them. And while I appreciate your… confidence in your health, Ms. Sciarrotta, "forgetting where you put your keys" could be an indication of several things. We’re not looking for perfection here, just a complete assessment. So, Vitamin D and Calcium, you said. What dosages?
PATIENT: Right, right. Dosages… Let me see. The Vitamin D is 2000 IU, and the Calcium is 500 milligrams. I take them with breakfast, every morning. And sometimes, when I feel a cold coming on, I take Vitamin C. Just extra, you know, for a boost. I think it’s a thousand milligrams. I get them all at the drugstore, they’re pretty standard. Is this taking too long, Doctor? I really do have a schedule… I can give you my doctor's number if that helps. He has everything written down, very detailed.
DOCTOR: “Alright. We’ll verify everything with Dr. Tanaka’s office. Now, Ms. Sciarrotta, let's discuss any family history of serious medical conditions – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, neurological disorders... anything that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart disease, sadly. He passed away when he was in his seventies. My mother, she had… well, she had high blood pressure, like me. And her mother had arthritis, so that probably explains my knees. No stroke or neurological anything on either side, as far as I know. They didn't really talk about medical things much back then, it was different. Everyone just sort of… dealt with it. Is that enough? Do you need to know about cousins and aunts and uncles too? It gets a little hazy after a while.
DOCTOR: “That’s sufficient for now. Now, Ms. Sciarrotta, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked. Never even tried it, honestly. My husband smoked, but I always told him to do it outside. It smelled awful. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Just one. Helps me relax. I also try to walk every day, if the weather is nice. It's good for the circulation, you know? I try to stay active. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: “One glass of wine… Alright. Now, are there any allergies we need to be aware of – to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat pretty much everything. I like spicy food, actually. Never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. Just the usual side effects sometimes, like a little bit of drowsiness. But nothing serious. I really pride myself on being healthy. Do you want me to list my favorite foods? Just to prove I have a good appetite? Is that what you need?
DOCTOR: “No, Ms. Sciarrotta, I do not need a list of your favorite foods. We're almost finished with the history portion of this assessment. Now, I need to perform a brief physical examination. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and reflexes. It’s standard procedure.” "Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Perfectly acceptable. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I really do have things to do. But thank you for asking all these questions. It’s good to be thorough. Where do you want me to sit, or should I… just stand here?
DOCTOR: "Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your blood pressure. And Ms. Sciarrotta, while I appreciate your… eagerness, I’ll be conducting this examination at a pace that ensures a thorough assessment. It is important.” “Please keep your arm still and relaxed.” “Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72 and regular.” “Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Retinal exam appears normal, though some mild age-related changes are present.” “Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is within normal limits.” "Everything appears within acceptable parameters, given your age. Now, just one more thing: Could you please tell me about any difficulties you have with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, my vision isn't quite what it used to be, naturally. I need reading glasses to see things up close, but my distance vision is okay. I have a little trouble hearing in crowded places, but I manage. Nothing that's really concerning. It’s just getting older. Is that what you want to hear? I am pretty sure all this is normal. Should I schedule an eye exam? I think it’s time, actually.
DOCTOR: “Yes, Ms. Sciarrotta, an eye exam would be prudent. And a hearing test wouldn’t be a bad idea, either. While these are not directly related to your ability to drive, it's important to address any sensory deficits. Given your history and the physical examination findings, I am willing to sign off on the medical card. However, there are a few stipulations. First, you must schedule a comprehensive eye exam and a hearing test within the next three months. Second, I recommend you discuss your slightly elevated blood pressure with your primary care physician, Dr. Tanaka. And finally, I advise you to limit your driving to daylight hours and avoid driving in adverse weather conditions.” “Do you understand and agree to these stipulations?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Absolutely. I understand and I agree. Eye exam, hearing test, talk to Dr. Tanaka, and careful driving. Daylight hours and good weather only. All perfectly reasonable. Thank you, Doctor. That’s a relief. Do I need to fill out any more forms, or… am I good to go? I really appreciate your time, and for not making me come back for more tests, if I can be honest. Is there anything I need to pay now?
DOCTOR: “You’re welcome, Ms. Sciarrotta. A standard form for the Department of Motor Vehicles needs to be completed. The receptionist will provide it to you. The cost for this assessment is \$75, payable at the front desk.” “I will also forward a summary of my findings to Dr. Tanaka’s office. While everything appears within acceptable limits, it’s important to maintain open communication with your primary care physician. Remember, this card is valid for one year only, and a repeat assessment will be required.” “Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. No further questions. Thank you again for your time and for being so thorough. And for not making me jump through too many hoops! I’ll go see the receptionist now and get the form. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: “Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Sciarrotta.”
