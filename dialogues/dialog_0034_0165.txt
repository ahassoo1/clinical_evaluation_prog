DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Seil. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doc. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever, keeps comin’ back. Been botherin’ me for a bit now, and honestly, I’m tired of it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. It’s good to meet you as well. I understand you’ve been dealing with a recurring fever. That certainly sounds frustrating. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn't come every day, thankfully. More like every couple of weeks, maybe? It’ll spike up, I feel kinda achy, you know, like the flu but not as bad. Then it goes away for a while. I haven't really been keepin' track of dates, to be honest. It just…happens.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s been an on-and-off issue for a bit. Not keeping track of the dates is perfectly alright; we can work through it. When you say it spikes up, do you know roughly what your temperature gets to, if you've taken it?
PATIENT: Yeah, I got one of those thermometers you stick in your mouth. Usually around 101, 102 when it’s bad. Sometimes a little higher, but not much. It definitely feels like a fever, no doubt about that. My wife usually checks it for me when I start feelin' rough.
DOCTOR: Okay, 101 to 102 Fahrenheit. That's good information. And it's helpful that your wife helps monitor it. Besides the fever and aches, have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a bit of a headache. Not a killer one, just…there. And I get real tired, even more than usual. I work a lot with my hands, bein' a chiropractor, so I'm always a little tired, but this is worse. No cough, no sniffles, nothin' like a cold. Oh, and I haven’t been hungry when it hits, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, headache, increased fatigue, and loss of appetite accompanying the fever and aches. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: Nope, haven't left the state in…oh, must be ten years now. Too much trouble, honestly. And no, nobody I've been around has been sick, not that I know of. I see patients all day, of course, but I try to keep things pretty clean. Wash my hands a lot, you know? I haven’t noticed anyone coughin' or sneezin’ on me lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Maintaining good hygiene is excellent. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ major. I had a bad back when I was younger, which is why I became a chiropractor, funny enough. But that’s all fixed now. Blood pressure's usually okay, a little high sometimes, but nothin’ they give me pills for. I don't take any regular medication, Doc. And no allergies, either. I’m a pretty healthy guy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major medical conditions, no medications, and no allergies. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… When I was a kid, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long time ago, probably around seven or eight years old. Other than that, nope. Never been in the hospital, never had surgery. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. I’m a pretty careful fella.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family, are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart trouble when he got older. And my mother… she had arthritis, real bad. It kept her from movin’ around much when she got old. Other than that, nothin’ that I can think of. My brother's healthy as a horse, always has been. We don’t really talk about health stuff much, to be honest. It’s kinda… bad luck to talk about it, in my family.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families to have their own beliefs about discussing health. Heart trouble in your father and arthritis in your mother – that’s helpful information. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' like that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. Don't care for the smell, to be honest. I'll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe one or two, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. I’m a pretty straight-laced fella, Doc. I gotta keep a clear head for my patients, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drugs. Alright, Clide, thank you for answering those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I'm hopin' you can figure out what's goin’ on with this fever. It’s just… wearin’ me down. Don't want to be laid up, got patients to see.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. Your temperature is currently 100.8 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, a little elevated but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling sounds. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection like pus or significant swelling. Ears look clear as well. Palpating your lymph nodes… slightly enlarged, but not alarmingly so. Alright, Clide. Everything seems relatively normal on the physical exam, but the slightly enlarged lymph nodes and your reported symptoms are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: So what does that mean, Doc? What are we lookin' at here? I don't like hearin’ “further investigation.” Is it somethin’ serious? I got a practice to run, you know? Can’t be missin’ work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide, and I want to assure you that we’re going to figure this out. “Further investigation” simply means we need to do some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s causing your recurring fever and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. It doesn’t necessarily mean something serious, but it’s best to rule things out. Given your symptoms – recurring fever, fatigue, headache, loss of appetite, and slightly enlarged lymph nodes – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a viral infection, a bacterial infection, or, less commonly, something else entirely. To start, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to check your overall health and look for signs of infection or inflammation. I'd also like to do a Monospot test to rule out mononucleosis, as it can cause similar symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… alright, fine. Do what you gotta do. But how long are we talkin’? And will I be able to work? I can’t just cancel on my patients, Doc. They depend on me. And how much is all this gonna cost? I don’t have insurance, so… it adds up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Clide. It’s frustrating to have to worry about tests and costs on top of feeling unwell. The blood tests should only take about 15-20 minutes, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. You should be perfectly able to work afterwards; they don't require any downtime. As for the cost, since you don’t have insurance, we can discuss a payment plan. The CBC and metabolic panel typically cost around \$150 each, and the Monospot test is usually around \$75. That’s a total of \$375. We do offer a discount for cash payments, which would bring the total down to \$325. We can also check if there are any local assistance programs available to help cover the costs, if you’re interested. I'll have my staff look into that for you. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity. If your fever spikes above 103 Fahrenheit, or if you develop any new symptoms like a severe cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please contact me immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, \$325… that’s… doable. I appreciate you lookin’ into assistance programs. And yeah, rest, water, I can do that. I’ll keep an eye on the temperature and watch for those other symptoms. So, blood tests… when can I get ‘em done? And where? I don’t wanna drive all over the county. I got a busy schedule, Doc. You gotta understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I understand completely. You have a busy schedule, and we’ll work around it. The lab is located right here in the clinic building, so you won’t have to drive anywhere. My staff can draw the blood for you immediately after this consultation. It should only take about 15-20 minutes, and then we’ll send it off to the lab for analysis. We typically have the results back within 24-48 hours, and my staff will contact you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or anything else before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Let's get it over with then. The sooner I know what's goin’ on, the better. Just… try not to poke me too much, alright? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. They’re very experienced and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. Let me have my staff come in and get you set up. They'll explain the process and answer any questions you may have. Thank you for your patience, and we’ll get to the bottom of this.
