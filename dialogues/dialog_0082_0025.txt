DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I want to... how you say... find out more about where my family come from. Like, a long time ago. I hear you can do testing with… with spit? To see where people really from? I want that.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, I understand. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing. That’s become quite popular. It can give you some interesting information about your family’s origins, though it's important to remember it's not always a complete picture. And yes, it usually involves a saliva sample. Before we get too far into that, just to be thorough, are you experiencing any health concerns today that brought you in?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Just… curious. My grandma, she tell stories about the islands, but… old stories. I want to know for sure. Like, paper says. You understand? Not just stories. I feel okay, strong for my age. I make little boats all the time.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Scobie. You want more concrete information to complement your grandmother’s stories – something verifiable. That’s perfectly reasonable. Just so I have a complete picture, even though you're feeling well, have you had any recent changes in your health – even small ones?
PATIENT: No changes. Same old, same old. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting old, right? I sleep good though. Eat fish mostly. My daughter, she worry I don’t eat enough, but I feel alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And feeling tired is common, especially as we get older. Eating fish is excellent, very healthy. Now, before we discuss the ancestry testing specifically, let's quickly go over a few things just to be sure everything's alright medically. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmmm… No, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with anything. I eat everything my daughter cook, even if it not my favorite. She like to try new things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And a tolerant daughter is a blessing! Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… the one little pill for my water. The doctor give it to me a long time ago. For my… how you say… pressure. But it not much. Just one every morning. And sometimes, I take a little thing for my bones, but not all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and something for your bones occasionally. Do you recall the names of those medications, if possible?
PATIENT: Hmmm… the pressure pill… I think it white? Small white pill. And the bone one… my daughter buy it for me. She know all the names. I just take them. Sorry, Doctor. I not good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Many people find it difficult to remember medication names. We can look it up in your records, if you’ve had prescriptions filled here before. Do you know which pharmacy you typically use?
PATIENT: I go to… the one near my daughter’s house. The big one. With the… the drive-through window. I think it called… something with a ‘V’ in it? It hard to remember. My daughter usually pick it up for me.
DOCTOR: Let me see… Ah, yes, Valley Pharmacy. Okay, that helps. It looks like you've been prescribed Lisinopril for your blood pressure, and Calcium with Vitamin D for your bones. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes! Lisinopril… that the one. And Calcium… yes, that right. You are good, Doctor! My daughter will be happy you know. She always worry about me.
DOCTOR: I'm glad we got that sorted out. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if there are any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandma… she had… trouble with her legs. Old age, I think. And my uncle… he get sick a long time ago. I think it something with his… lungs? He smoke a lot. But that was a long time ago, before I was old. Not many people get sick in my family. We mostly just… get old.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble with your grandmother’s legs, and lung issues with your uncle due to smoking. That’s helpful to know. Now, shifting back to today… you mentioned wanting to explore your ancestry. Have you ever had any genetic testing done before?
PATIENT: No, never. This would be first time. My daughter, she talk about it. She say she can order it online, but I want to ask you first. You know, make sure it okay. And maybe you can help me understand what it all means?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. That’s a very smart idea to discuss it with your doctor first. I’m happy to help you with that. There are several reputable companies that offer ancestry testing. The most common type uses a saliva sample, as you mentioned. They analyze your DNA to estimate your ethnic origins and can also provide information about potential relatives. Before we proceed, I want to make sure you understand that ancestry testing cannot tell you about your current health risks or diagnose any medical conditions. It's purely for informational purposes. And the results are estimates, so they aren't always 100% accurate. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You mean it won't tell me if I get sick? Just where my family come from? That okay. I not worried about sick. Just want to know… where I really from. My grandma always tell stories, but… I want to see it, you know? Like on paper. So it good to know it not about sick. Thank you for telling me.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Scobie. You've got it. It's about tracing your roots, and confirming family stories. Now, there are a few different companies we can consider. 23andMe and AncestryDNA are two of the most popular. They both offer similar services, and the costs are fairly comparable. They typically send a kit to your home, you provide a saliva sample, mail it back, and then you receive the results online in a few weeks. Would you like me to provide you with some information about these companies, so you can compare them and decide which one is best for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Information would be good. Maybe you can write down the names? I forget easy. And... how long does it take to get the answers? A few weeks? That long?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. 23andMe – that’s T-W-E-N-T-Y-T-H-R-E-E-A-N-D-M-E – and AncestryDNA – A-N-C-E-S-T-R-Y-D-N-A. And yes, it usually takes about 6-8 weeks to receive the results. They need time to analyze the DNA sample. They will send you an email when the results are available, and you can access them through their website. I can also print out some information sheets about each company, outlining their services and costs. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please! Sheets would be good. My daughter can help me read it. She good with computers. She always say I too old for all that stuff. But I want to try. I really do. So sheets would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. Here you go. These sheets have some basic information about 23andMe and AncestryDNA. They also include their website addresses and contact information. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. You answer all my questions. Thank you very much, Doctor. My daughter will be happy I came. And she can help me with the computer stuff.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you have any questions after reviewing the information sheets, or if anything else comes up, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you enjoy learning more about your family history!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor! You too! .
