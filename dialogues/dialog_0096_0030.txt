DOCTOR: Alright, Kerriann Purtee, 49 years old. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Burlingham. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It’s not a bad smell, exactly, just… different. Not like me, you know? I can’t really explain it. It started maybe a month or so ago.
DOCTOR: Different, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, different. It's hard to put into words. It’s…sweeter, I guess? And a little stronger, even if I just used deodorant. I usually don’t have problems with smelling, even working as a floor layer all day. It's just…not the usual Kerriann smell, if that makes sense. I've tried different deodorants, stronger ones, but it doesn't really help.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said this started about a month ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly a month. Maybe six weeks. It wasn’t sudden, it was more like… I noticed it getting a little bit more noticeable each day. I thought maybe it was the heat, you know? It’s been really warm lately. But it’s still there even when it’s cooler, or after I shower. I’m just worried about it, honestly. I don't want people to think…well, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t been sick or anything. No fever, no weight loss, nothing like that. My appetite is normal. I’ve been sleeping okay, maybe a little restless sometimes, but that’s nothing new. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been sweating a little more than usual, even when I'm not working. But I thought that was just because of the summer. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Sweating more...yes, that is relevant. And restless sleep... alright. Now, Kerriann, are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don't take anything regularly. Just over-the-counter stuff when I have a headache, like ibuprofen. And I haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalized in years. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat pretty well, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of hay fever in the spring, that’s it. Nothing serious, just sniffles and a runny nose. I usually just take an antihistamine when it gets bad. No food allergies or anything like that. I can eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And family history... is there anyone in your family with… unusual body odor, or any medical conditions that run in the family, for that matter?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think... My mother had diabetes, type 2, but that's the only thing I can think of off the top of my head. And my grandmother on my father’s side had high blood pressure. As far as body odor goes, no, not that I’m aware of. No one ever talked about it, if they did. I don’t really know much about my father’s side of the family, to be honest. He wasn't around much when I was growing up. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: We’ll note the diabetes and hypertension. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and just have a listen to your heart and lungs. And… I'm going to need to examine you, Kerriann. Specifically, I’ll need to take a look at your skin, particularly in areas where sweat glands are concentrated. It’s routine, of course, but I need to rule out any visible issues. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Yes, I understand. That’s… that’s a bit embarrassing, but I guess it makes sense. If you need to check my skin, that’s fine. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat and undress from the waist up. I’ll be right back with the stethoscope. Don’t worry, it’s all quite standard.
