DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Petrimoulx, was it? Yes, right. It’s… about a letter. A letter I need for… well, for my dog. He’s a good boy, really. Needs a letter, that’s all. Something about… ownership, I think? Honestly, the whole thing is a bit of a fuss. People these days!
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter regarding ownership of your dog. I understand. It sounds like you may need a statement confirming you are the owner, perhaps for housing or insurance purposes?
PATIENT: Housing, yes! That’s it. New landlord is being… particular. Wants everything in writing. Honestly, it's ridiculous. I’ve had Winston – that’s my dog – for years! Everyone in the building knows he's mine. But alright, paperwork, I suppose. Is this going to take long? I have a… a thing later. Not important. Just a thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. New landlords can sometimes be very strict with documentation. We can definitely get a statement put together for you. It shouldn’t take too long. To make sure the statement is accurate, I just need a little bit of information. First, could you tell me a little about Winston?
PATIENT: Oh, Winston. He’s a… a mixed breed. Honestly, I don’t even remember what all he is. Something fluffy. Big. Brown, mostly. He’s a good size. Not tiny, definitely not a little lapdog. He needs a good walk every day, that much I know. Found him at the shelter, years ago. A real sweetheart, but… a bit of a puller on the leash. Does that matter for a letter? I just need them to know I’m responsible. He’s a good boy, I tell you!
DOCTOR: No, the leash-pulling isn't relevant for the letter, Deloris! Just trying to get a general picture. You mentioned finding him at a shelter. Do you recall roughly when you adopted him?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… dates are not my strong suit. Let me think… it was… after my divorce, definitely. So… sometime after 2020, I suppose? Maybe 2021? It all feels like a blur, honestly. A long time ago, anyway. Before that, I was… preoccupied. A lot going on. Was it a warm summer when I got him? Maybe. He was just a puppy then, all wobbly legs.
DOCTOR: That's alright, a rough estimate is fine. So, sometime in 2021. And you remember adopting him as a puppy. That helps. Do you happen to know which shelter it was?
PATIENT: Ugh, the shelter… honestly, there were so many options back then. I was just trying to get out of the house, you know? I think… maybe it was the one on Elm Street? It was a big one. Had lots of dogs. I just… picked him because he looked at me. Sounds silly, I know. He just… needed me. I don’t remember the name of the place, though. Sorry. Is this making things difficult? I knew I should have kept better records.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Deloris. It's understandable to not remember every detail. We can work with what we have. The shelter on Elm Street is helpful. Let's switch gears a little. Do you have any documentation at all related to Winston – vaccination records, perhaps, or adoption paperwork, even if it doesn't have the shelter's name?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, actually. I think… I have a folder somewhere. With all sorts of things. Bills, old photographs… probably his vet records in there too. They're… somewhere in the spare room. It's a bit of a mess, I warn you. My daughter used to say it was a fire hazard. I’ll have to dig around. Give me a moment. It might take a while. Honestly, I should really get that room organized…
DOCTOR: Take your time, Deloris. No rush at all. While you’re looking, perhaps you could tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Health. That's… fine. I mean, I get by. A little achy sometimes. You know, getting older. Nothing major. Doctor says I need to watch my cholesterol, but I… I forget. A lot. And I have a bit of trouble sleeping. That's about it. Nothing exciting. I’m not a sickly person, if that makes sense. Just… normal old lady stuff. Honestly, I'm more concerned about Winston right now. He gets stressed easily, and I need to make sure he's allowed to stay.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern for Winston is a priority. It’s good that you’re generally healthy, though we will make a note of the cholesterol and sleep issues to discuss further later, if you’d like. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was ages ago. Nothing serious, no anaphylactic shock or anything. I took some antibiotics last year for… a chest thing. Didn't react badly to those, as far as I recall. Honestly, I’m terrible at remembering these things. My daughter always handled all the medical stuff when she was around. She had a very organized spreadsheet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies and only seasonal allergies in the past. That's good to know. And you mentioned you took antibiotics for a chest condition last year. Do you recall what that condition was diagnosed as, or which doctor you saw for that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… Dr. Anya Sharma, I think? On Maple Drive? She was new then, very nice lady. As for the chest thing… bronchitis, maybe? Pneumonia? Something like that. I just remember coughing a lot and feeling very tired. She gave me a strong antibiotic, and it cleared up eventually. I wasn’t really paying attention to the details, to be honest. I just wanted to feel better. I am terrible with names and dates, you know? It's frustrating. My brain is just… foggy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Deloris. It’s common to forget details, especially when you weren’t feeling well. We can always look up your records from Dr. Sharma later if needed. Now, let's talk about any medications you’re currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all.
PATIENT: Oh, right. Medications. Let me see… I take a little something for my cholesterol, but I can't remember the name. It’s a small, white pill. I take it every morning… sometimes. When I remember. And I take a multivitamin, just a basic one. Nothing fancy. Oh, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for my aches and pains, but only when they’re really bad. That's about it, I think. Nothing regular, really. Just bits and pieces as needed. It’s all rather haphazard, I admit. I should probably be more organized…
DOCTOR: Okay, a cholesterol medication , a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. We can certainly try to get the name of your cholesterol medication if you'd like. Now, before we finish up, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And she had some trouble with her heart later in life. My father… he was always very healthy, actually. Didn’t get sick much. But his brother… he had diabetes. And my aunt… I think she had cancer, but it was a long time ago. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. We weren't very close as a family. Didn't talk about these things much. Is this important? I’m just trying to remember what little I can…
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, Deloris, even if the information is limited. We can always try to obtain more detailed records later if needed. And it sounds like there may be some family history of heart disease, diabetes, and potentially cancer. Now, one final question. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. Never smoked a day in my life. Disgusting habit, really. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped that a while ago. Doctor said it wasn't helping my cholesterol. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a respectable woman. Never touched anything like that. I just want to get this letter for Winston, honestly. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Deloris, that’s not asking too much at all. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me. Okay, to summarise, you’re generally healthy, with some issues with cholesterol and sleep. You have a history of bronchitis last year, and a potential family history of heart disease and diabetes. You’re not a smoker or drinker, and you don't use recreational drugs. Now, let’s see about getting a statement together for Winston. Do you happen to have any photographs of you with Winston that could help verify ownership?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, actually. I think… I have a whole album full of pictures of him. He's so cute as a puppy! I’ll have to go and get it. It’s… in the spare room. Right next to the folder with all the medical records. It’s a bit of a mess, as I said. But the pictures are lovely. He's grown so much! Just give me a moment, please. It'll probably take a while to find everything…
DOCTOR: Take your time, Deloris. I'll be right here. Don’t hesitate to ask if you need any assistance. I’ll just make a few notes while you search. And perhaps while you’re looking, you can think about what exactly you need the landlord to confirm in the statement – simply that you are the owner, or any other specific details?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good point! I suppose… just that he’s my dog. And that I’ve had him for several years. That should be enough, right? He’s being so difficult! Honestly, some people… well, never mind. I'll see if I can find those pictures. It's all a bit overwhelming, you know? But Winston is worth it. He’s a good boy. A very good boy.
DOCTOR:
