DOCTOR: Alright, Mykeisha. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Havird. It's my blood pressure, really. It's been a bit high lately, and I figured I should get it checked out. My neighbor, Elsie, she kept saying I should come in.
DOCTOR: "A bit high," you say. And how high is "a bit high," exactly?
PATIENT: Well, Elsie has one of those machines, you know, for at home. She checked it a couple times when I was over there, and it was around...140 over 90, maybe? I don't really remember the second number exactly, but the first one was definitely over 140. I don't usually pay attention to numbers, to be honest. It just felt…high when she told me what it was.
DOCTOR: Right. And when was the last time you had it checked by a professional?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It's been a while. Probably…at least five years ago? Maybe longer. I usually only go to the doctor when something is really wrong, you know? I’m not one for routine check-ups. I feel fine, mostly. Just a little tired sometimes, but who isn't, right?
DOCTOR: "Fine" is subjective, Mykeisha. And five years is… a considerable amount of time to go without monitoring blood pressure. Do you have any family history of hypertension, or heart problems, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had high blood pressure. Real bad. She was always getting dizzy spells and stuff. And my uncle, he had a heart attack a few years back. Not a massive one, thankfully, but still. He’s doing okay now, but he’s gotta watch his diet, you know? Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It matters. Family history is… relevant. Have you made any changes to your lifestyle recently?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Not really, no. Work’s been the same – still doing home care, a few different clients here and there. I’ve been trying to walk a little more, but it’s hot outside, so that hasn’t been happening as much as I’d like. I haven’t changed my eating habits, still loving my macaroni pie, if that’s what you mean!
DOCTOR: Macaroni pie… Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, no. Not regularly, anyway. Just over-the-counter stuff when I have a headache, like paracetamol. And no allergies that I know of. I eat everything! Except maybe oysters, they just look…slimy. But that's not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get some readings and take a look. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we'll check your blood pressure. Then we can talk about next steps. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if anything feels weird, okay? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is… 152 over 94. And your pulse is 78 and regular. As I suspected. It’s elevated.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, huh? That doesn’t sound good. Elsie was right then. What does that mean, though? Is it…serious? I feel fine, mostly. Just a little tired sometimes, but I figured that was just from work.
DOCTOR: “Fine” is relative, Mykeisha. And consistently elevated blood pressure is a concern. It puts strain on your heart, kidneys, and other organs. It doesn't necessarily mean you’ll have symptoms immediately, but it increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure down the line. It’s not something to ignore, especially with your family history. We need to get this under control. I’m going to order some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any secondary causes of hypertension. And we need to discuss lifestyle modifications and potentially medication.
PATIENT: Okay…that sounds…scary. Blood work and medication… I was hoping to avoid that, to be honest. What kind of lifestyle changes are we talking about? I really do love my macaroni pie. Is there anything else I can do besides changing my diet and taking pills? Maybe some exercises or something?
DOCTOR: Look, Mykeisha, I understand you’re hesitant. But ignoring this won’t make it go away. Lifestyle modifications are crucial – reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, managing stress. And yes, that may mean limiting your macaroni pie. As for exercises, regular aerobic activity – brisk walking, swimming, cycling – can make a significant difference. However, with your current blood pressure readings and your family history, lifestyle changes alone may not be enough. Medication may be necessary to protect your organs and prevent serious complications. I want to start with the blood work to get a clearer picture of your overall health before we decide on a course of action. We can discuss medication options if necessary, and I will explain the risks and benefits thoroughly. I’m going to write you a requisition for the blood work. You can go to the lab down the hall. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay…that sounds…reasonable, I guess. Blood work first, then we’ll see. I don’t like the sound of pills, but I understand what you’re saying about protecting my health. And I will try to cut back on the macaroni pie, maybe just on weekends. Okay, give me the form. And…thank you, Dr. Havird. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The lab will take your insurance information, and the results should be available in a few days. They will likely contact you directly to schedule a follow-up. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions in the meantime. We’ll re-evaluate once we have the results. And try your best with the macaroni pie. It’s a small step, but every bit helps. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Havird. I guess I’ll go get this blood work done then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mykeisha. .
