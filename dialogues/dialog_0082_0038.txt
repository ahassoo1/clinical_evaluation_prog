DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I’m here to discuss… some paperwork. Advance planning, I was told? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it once was, so I don’t recall the specifics. Something about… what happens if I can’t make decisions for myself?
DOCTOR: Right, advance planning. Yes, that sounds like a very sensible thing to do. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little foggy on the details, especially when it comes to legal matters. We call it advance directives – things like a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare. It basically outlines your wishes and who you'd like to make decisions on your behalf if you were unable to do so yourself. Before we dive into that, perhaps we could just go over a bit of your overall health history?
PATIENT: My health history… Yes. That’s… difficult. I’ve moved around quite a bit, and frankly, I’ve not kept very good records. I was divorced several years ago, and much of that information may have been with my… former spouse. I do know I have private insurance, and I try to eat a balanced diet. I work as an etcher – it requires a steady hand, so I suppose I’m generally healthy enough for that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Evann, thank you. It’s alright about the records – we can work with what we have. The etching does tell me something about your dexterity, which is good. And having private insurance is excellent. Let's start with any significant medical conditions you do recall. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything – high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, things like that?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. I’ve had the usual… colds, perhaps a bad flu once or twice. I broke my wrist when I was younger – a foolish accident, really – but it healed well. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly for… quite some time. I’m afraid I’m not a very good patient. Is it important I recall the specifics of that wrist break?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Evann. Many people aren't regular visitors to the doctor's office. And yes, knowing about the wrist break is good, just for a complete picture. It gives us a baseline. Did you have any surgeries related to the wrist break?
PATIENT: I… believe so. Yes. I recall being in the hospital, and… a cast. A rather uncomfortable cast, as I remember. It was quite a long time ago, though. I was living in… a different city then. I think it was a simple fracture, not too complicated, but they did need to set it. Do you need the name of the hospital? I doubt I would remember it at this point.
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about the hospital name right now. Knowing you had surgery to set the fracture is enough for now. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… is very spread out. I haven’t been in contact with many of them for years. My mother… she was quite frail in her later years, I recall. Something with her heart, perhaps? But I wasn’t involved in her care, so I don’t have any details. My father… he was a very stoic man. He never spoke much about his health. I’m afraid I can’t offer much help on that front. I apologize. It feels rather irresponsible of me, not knowing more.
DOCTOR: You have no need to apologize, Evann. Family history can be difficult to gather, especially with distance and time. You're doing the best you can. It’s alright. Let's switch gears a bit. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: To my knowledge, no. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I eat a rather varied diet, and I haven’t had any issues with shellfish or nuts. I haven’t taken much medication over the years – just the occasional pain reliever for a headache. Should I be actively recalling specific medications? Perhaps I have forgotten something?
DOCTOR: No, no need to strain yourself. It's good that you haven't noticed any allergies, and occasional pain relievers are unlikely to be a concern. We're just covering all the bases. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. I stopped taking a multivitamin a few months ago. I found it wasn’t… agreeing with me. It gave me a rather upset stomach, I believe. Other than that, nothing. I try to get my nutrients from my diet. Is that… sufficient? I worry I’m not providing enough information.
DOCTOR: You are providing plenty of information, Evann. It's good you stopped the multivitamin if it upset your stomach. And it's perfectly fine to worry about providing enough details – that shows you're engaged in your health. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam would be good. I haven’t had one in… well, a very long time. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Is there anything I should do to prepare? I do tend to get a bit… anxious during medical examinations. Perhaps I should have brought someone with me?
DOCTOR: No preparation needed, Evann. Just relax as much as you can. And no need to worry about being anxious – it’s perfectly normal. I’ll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. And no, bringing someone wasn't necessary, but you're welcome to do so anytime. First, I’m going to check your height and weight. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. After that, I'll take a look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds reasonable. It’s a bit daunting, but I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed at your own pace. And if I… become overly anxious, please do let me know. I’m not accustomed to this. I suppose it’s best to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your height and weight. Okay, 183 centimeters and 123 pounds. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, blood pressure. Blood pressure is 120 over 80, which is excellent. Now, let's take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look clear. Finally, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal so far. Everything seems to be within normal limits on the physical exam. Now, with your permission, I’d like to run some routine blood work just to get a more detailed baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That… is reassuring to hear, Doctor. Yes, blood work would be… sensible. A more detailed baseline is a good idea. I want to ensure I haven’t overlooked anything. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Do I need to fast beforehand? I do apologize for my constant questions. I simply want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Evann. Your questions are perfectly reasonable, and I’m happy to answer them. Yes, for the routine blood work, I would like you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. We’ll schedule that for tomorrow morning. Now, going back to your original reason for coming in – the advance planning. Do you have any specific wishes regarding a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: That’s… the difficult part. Honestly, I haven’t given it much thought. I know I want someone to make decisions for me if I’m unable to, but I haven’t decided who or what those decisions should be. I’m not sure I’m prepared to articulate my wishes at this moment. Would it be helpful to have some time to consider this? Perhaps some… resources to guide my thinking? I don’t want to make any hasty decisions. It feels like a rather… weighty responsibility.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s perfectly alright. It’s a big decision, and there’s no need to rush. We can definitely take our time. I have some pamphlets and online resources I can give you that outline the process and help you think through your options. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it in more detail once you've had a chance to review them. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. Hmmm… yes, actually. What sort of decisions would this… durable power of attorney be making? Is it just medical treatments, or… does it extend to financial matters as well? And what happens if the person I choose is… unavailable? Or unwilling to act? It feels like a lot to consider. I apologize for my relentless questioning. I simply want to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Evann. These are all excellent questions, and it’s good you're thinking about these things. A durable power of attorney for healthcare specifically grants someone the authority to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. It does not extend to financial matters – that would require a separate document. As for what happens if the person you choose is unavailable or unwilling to act, you can name alternate agents. The documents specify the order in which they would be contacted. And if none of your designated agents are available, a court-appointed guardian would ultimately make the decisions. We can discuss this in more detail during the follow-up appointment, and I can help you complete the necessary paperwork. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood work scheduled. Does tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning would be fine. Yes, that’s… manageable. And thank you, Doctor. For your patience, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel… a little less anxious now. Perhaps I can actually approach this without feeling completely overwhelmed. I believe that is all for now. Unless you have any further questions for me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I'm glad I could help. And no, I don’t have any further questions for you at this time. Just remember to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work tomorrow. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you, and she'll also give you these pamphlets. It was a pleasure meeting you, Evann. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment. Take care.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. And thank you again for your kindness. I shall see you tomorrow. Have a good day.
