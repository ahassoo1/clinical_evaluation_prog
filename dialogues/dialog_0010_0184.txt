DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Doctor, yes. Look, I ain’t got all day. It’s… it’s this. It’s gone soft. Used to be hard as a rock, you understand? Pile drivin’ ain’t easy work. Now… well, now it’s just… there. Wife used to like it firm. Don’t matter now, she gone, but still. It’s embarrassing. What can you do about it?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're concerned about some changes you've noticed. It’s good you brought this to my attention. When did you first start noticing this change?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know exactly. Months, maybe? After… after she passed. Didn't have much reason to… keep up appearances, you see? And the eatin’ got worse. Used to be just beans and rice to keep the strength up, now it’s… well, never you mind what it is. Point is, it happened. Ain’t askin’ for a miracle, just want it… tighter. Is that even possible at my age? I’m seventy-six, you know. Not a young sprout anymore.
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible to address this, Mr. Trendler, even at seventy-six. There are a number of factors that can contribute to these changes – loss of muscle mass with age, changes in diet and activity level, and even emotional factors as you mentioned. Before we discuss potential options, I’d like to get a more complete picture of your overall health. Have you experienced any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I get tired easier, that’s for sure. Used to work a full eight hours, no problem. Now, I need a nap after just a few. And my knees… don’t even get me started on my knees. They ache somethin’ fierce. But that’s just old age, I figure. I ain’t askin' you to fix my knees, just want somethin’ done about… this. You understand? Don’t need a whole life overhaul. Just… tighten it up. Is it gonna involve a lot of pokin’ and proddin’? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Trendler. The fatigue and knee pain are important to note as well – they could be related. And no, we don’t necessarily need a lot of “poking and prodding” right away. First, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'll also want to review your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Humph. Not that I know of. Never had much trouble with pills. Took some for the pressure, doctor said I had it high, but they made me feel funny, so I stopped. Didn’t bother me enough to keep takin’ ‘em. And… that’s about it. No fancy allergies. Just want to get this sorted. So, you gonna poke me now? And how long is this gonna take? I got a dominoes game at two. Important game. Don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. No problem at all. We'll keep it brief, I promise. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, a feel of your abdomen, and I’ll check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Before we start, can you tell me if you've had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… When I was a young man, broke my arm fallin’ off a roof. They set it, put it in a cast. That was… sixty years ago, maybe more. And… no, that’s it. No other surgeries. Just the arm. Simple break. They didn’t dig nothin’ out or nothin’. Plain and simple. Now, are you gonna poke me already? This waitin’ is worse than the pokin’, you know. Dominoes don’t wait for nobody.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No other surgeries. Okay, let's get started then. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs first.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. And be gentle, alright? This old body ain’t what it used to be. And don’t be listenin’ for too long, I got things to do. Dominoes, remember? Important game. You wouldn’t understand. Now, poke away. But quick, please. Really quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, a bit of diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, which is not uncommon with age. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Hmph. There! That’s tender. Right there. Not painful, exactly, just… sensitive. Always been sensitive there. Probably from all the heavy liftin’ over the years. Pile drivin’ ain't exactly a desk job, you know. Don't press so hard, though. It's already complainin’ enough. And hurry up, will ya? Dominoes…
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve noted the tenderness in that area. That’s helpful. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Extend my legs? Old bones don't bend like they used to, you know. Be careful now. Don't go yankin' nothin'. Get it over with. Dominoes… just thinkin' about it. Important game. Need my reflexes sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, good response on both sides. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for your age, but symmetrical. Alright, Mr. Trendler, that’s all I need for now. Thank you for your patience. So, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some changes related to age, potentially exacerbated by changes in your diet and activity level. The tenderness in your abdomen could be from previous strain, and the fatigue and diminished reflexes are also common. Now, let's talk about some potential options. Before we get to that, could you tell me a little more about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Hmph. Typical diet, you say? Well, it ain't fancy. Used to be beans and rice, like I said, keepin’ the strength up for work. Now… now it’s whatever’s easiest. Lot of fried chicken, some pasta. I like a good sweet potato, but not as much as I used to. And I drink a little rum, sometimes. Helps me sleep. Not a lot, mind you. Just a little. But don't judge me. A man deserves a little comfort, don't he? And I ain't eatin' no rabbit food. No salads or nothin’. Just want somethin’ to tighten this up. Don't need a whole life change. Just… somethin’. What can you do? And don't tell me to eat better, alright? I'm seventy-six years old. I’ve been eatin’ what I like for a long time now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. I’m not going to tell you to drastically change your diet. We can work with what you’re already comfortable with. There are a few things we can consider. We can discuss some exercises to help strengthen your core muscles, which can provide some support. We could also explore some options for managing your fatigue, and possibly look at some supplements that might be helpful. Now, before we dive into those options, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High cholesterol, maybe. Doctor told me somethin’ about it years ago, said I needed pills. Didn't like how they made me feel, so I stopped takin’ ‘em. As for diabetes… no, never been told I had that. Just… tired, sometimes. And my knees ache, like I said. But that’s just old age. Look, I ain’t a complicated case. Just want to tighten this up. Core muscles, you say? Sounds like hard work. I'm already tired as it is. Is there anything… easier? Anything that doesn’t involve a lot of strainin’ and sweatin’? I got a dominoes game, remember? Important game. Can’t be showin’ up all exhausted and out of breath. Now, what’s this about supplements? Anythin’ I can drink with my rum? Just kiddin’. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Trendler. We definitely don't want to exhaust you before your dominoes game. There are some options that don't involve strenuous exercise. We can discuss some gentle core strengthening exercises that can be done seated, and some stretches to improve your flexibility. As for supplements, there are a few that might be helpful, but I want to be cautious. Some supplements can interact with medications, and some can have side effects. Before we talk about specifics, I'd like to run a few blood tests to get a better picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Humph. More pokin’ and proddin’? Look, doctor, I ain't afraid of a little discomfort, but I'm tellin' ya, I ain't a complicated case. Just want to tighten this up. Why do you need to poke around inside me? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m seventy-six, not a young sprout. If somethin’ was seriously wrong, I’d probably already be… well, never mind. Just tell me straight. Can you tighten this up or can’t you? No fancy tests, no rabbit food, just… a simple solution. Is there a pill or somethin’? Or a cream? Anythin’ easy? Dominoes, doctor. Remember? Important game. I need my strength. And my focus. I can’t be worryin’ about blood tests and fancy diets. Now, what's your honest opinion? Can you help me or can’t you?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration and I want to be honest with you. There isn’t a “quick fix” or a magic pill to simply “tighten things up.” What we can do is work together to improve your overall health and address the underlying factors that are contributing to these changes. The blood tests will help me rule out any medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue or muscle weakness. It will also give me a baseline to monitor your progress. There are some medications that might be helpful, but they come with risks and side effects, and they won’t be effective unless we address your overall health. I believe that with some gentle exercise, a few dietary adjustments, and possibly some supplements, we can improve your strength, energy levels, and overall well-being. But it will require some effort on your part. Would you be willing to consider the blood tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Effort. Seventy-six years old and you’re talkin’ about effort. Fine. Fine! Do your pokin’ and proddin’. But quick, alright? And don’t keep me waitin’ all day. I got a dominoes game, remember? Important game. And don't expect miracles. Just want to tighten this up. That’s all. No fancy speeches, no rabbit food, just… a little help. Now, where do we start? And how long is this gonna take? I got places to be. Dominoes, doctor. Dominoes. .
