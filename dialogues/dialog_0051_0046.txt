DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing a lot of pressure in my bladder lately. It’s been… quite bothersome, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, about two months now, give or take a week. It hasn’t been constant, but it’s been frequent enough to be worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, two months. And can you describe the pressure?
PATIENT: It feels…full, even when I’ve just gone to the restroom. It's not painful, exactly, but definitely uncomfortable. Like there’s a weight there, and a constant urge to go, even when there isn't much to go, if that makes sense? Sometimes it’s more of a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A feeling of fullness, even after voiding, and a frequent urge… and sometimes a dull ache. Has this been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: It has, yes. I work from home as a graphic designer, so thankfully it's not like I'm needing to rush out of meetings. But it's distracting, and I find myself needing to go more often while I'm working, which breaks my concentration. It also makes me hesitant to go out for long periods, just in case. It's…limiting.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s impacting your work and your social life. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this bladder pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no pain in my back. I haven't noticed any blood in my urine, thankfully. I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, but I just assumed that was from working long hours. I suppose it could be related? Oh, and I've been drinking a lot more water, trying to flush things out, but that just means I need to go even more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no back pain, no blood in the urine, increased fatigue, and increased water intake leading to more frequent urination. I see. Now, have you had any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine... well, it seems a little darker than usual, now that you mention it. Not dramatically, but definitely not the pale yellow it normally is. And sometimes it smells a little stronger, but I've been drinking so much water I figured that was just normal. I haven’t noticed anything else unusual, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, darker urine and a stronger odor. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like a urinary tract infection or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I've always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I’ve never had a UTI, and I don’t have any known kidney problems. My family… my mother has high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but I haven’t been diagnosed with either of those. I have Medicare, so I get regular checkups, and everything has always been normal.
DOCTOR: Good, good. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing of the sort. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was outpatient, and it was many years ago. Otherwise, I’ve been very fortunate and haven’t needed any surgeries or hospital stays. I try to take good care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just a daily multivitamin, and occasionally ibuprofen for headaches. But nothing regularly, and I haven’t taken any ibuprofen in the past week. I don’t have any allergies to medications that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen, no known allergies. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also do a quick neurological check. Just to rule out any obvious issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, if you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It may be a little cool, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Okay… everything sounds normal so far. No unusual bowel sounds or bruits. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please cross your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay… reflexes are normal bilaterally. And I’m going to do a quick sensory exam. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. I feel it on both sides. It feels… normal. Not numb or tingling or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not painful, exactly, but it’s a little… sensitive. Right around here. It feels… full, like there’s pressure there. Like I’m feeling it more intensely now that you’re pressing on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region. And no rebound tenderness, I'm noting. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis, just to rule out a urinary tract infection, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Absolutely. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do. A urinalysis and a blood test… that sounds perfectly fine. How will I go about getting those done?
DOCTOR: Great. The nurse will draw the blood for the basic metabolic panel right here in the clinic. And she’ll give you a container for the urinalysis sample. You’ll need to collect a midstream sample, and she’ll explain how to do that properly. The lab results should be back within a couple of days. Once I have those, we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A midstream sample… I think I remember how to do that from a previous checkup, but I appreciate the nurse explaining it again just to be sure. A couple of days for the results… that sounds reasonable. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting some tests done to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. It’s important to rule things out, and these tests will give us a better understanding of what’s happening. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, back pain, or severe pain, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. We want to make sure we address anything urgent right away. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for being so thorough and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your time and attention. I’ll wait to hear from the nurse about the tests, and I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes.
