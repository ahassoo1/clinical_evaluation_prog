DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Glazewski. Now, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think. A ride-share one? Or a taxi one? Something like that. I drive a bit for extra money, you see, and they want me to have this card now. It’s all very new to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it sounds like you need a medical evaluation to fulfill a requirement for driving commercially – perhaps for a ride-sharing service or taxi company. That's perfectly alright, we can certainly help with that. Just to be clear, and to make sure I have everything right, are you currently driving for a company like Uber or Lyft, or are you planning to start?
PATIENT: No, no Uber or Lyft. Not yet, anyway. I was driving a bit for a local company, a smaller one, but they just folded. It was just a temporary thing, really. Now I’m thinking of doing it again, maybe with a different company, but they all want this card first. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly. I just want to get it done and be on my way.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a requirement from potential employers, not a current one. That's helpful to know. These evaluations are fairly standard, and we'll make sure to cover everything they need. To start, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… Well, my arthritis acts up sometimes, mostly in my hands and knees. It’s been getting worse lately, I suppose. And I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Everything went fine, though. No problems since. And… let me see… I take a little medicine for my blood pressure, but it’s not very strong. Nothing else, I think. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands and knees, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and medication for blood pressure. That's good information, thank you. And you mentioned walking every morning – that's excellent! What is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a little white pill… I always have trouble remembering these names. My daughter helps me refill it. Oh! Wait a minute… I think it’s… Lisinopril? Is that right? Yes, I believe it’s Lisinopril. A small dose, though. Just ten milligrams.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10 milligrams. Perfect. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any problems with anything like that. I eat pretty much everything. I can’t think of a single thing I’m allergic to. And I haven’t had a reaction to any medicine, ever. Lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision… It’s not as good as it used to be, naturally. I wear glasses, as you can see. I had my eyes checked last year, and the prescription was the same. But sometimes it's a little blurry, especially at night. Driving at night is harder now, you know? The glare bothers me. But I haven’t had any sudden changes. Just the usual getting older stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and sensitivity to glare, especially at night. We may want to get an update from your optometrist, just to be thorough. Do you have any history of neurological conditions – things like stroke, seizures, or significant head injuries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never had a stroke or a seizure, thank goodness. And I’ve been very lucky with head injuries. A few bumps here and there as a child, but nothing serious. I’ve always been careful, you know? I don’t do anything reckless. And my memory is still pretty good, all things considered. I remember everything! Well, mostly.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, but she didn’t take care of herself very well. She ate too much sugar, you know? And my father… he had heart trouble when he got older. He smoked a lot, unfortunately. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like me. Nothing else that I can think of, really. My family wasn’t very good about going to the doctor, so I don’t know a lot about their medical history. They didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life! I can’t stand the smell of it. My husband smoked, unfortunately, but I always made him smoke outside. I always told him it was terrible for his health, and well… he knew I was right.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear you never smoked. And do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a little glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Just a small glass. Maybe two or three times a week. Nothing heavy. It helps me relax, you know? I don't drink to excess. I'm very careful about that. My husband liked his whiskey, but I always preferred wine.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. That’s good to know. Lastly, are you currently experiencing any pain, dizziness, or any other concerning symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, my arthritis does bother me sometimes, mostly in the mornings. It's a dull ache, nothing terrible. And occasionally, when I stand up too quickly, I get a little dizzy, but it passes quickly. Other than that, I’m pretty good. For my age, anyway. I try to stay active, you know? Walking helps a lot. I don’t want to just sit around all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta, thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of your health. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a quick neurological assessment – check your reflexes and balance – and a basic vision screening. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I want to get this done as quickly as possible, you know? I have a few things I need to take care of this afternoon. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138 over 76. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning given your history. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I’m a little unsteady sometimes, you know? This arthritis makes it hard to get going. But I try to keep moving.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Your gait is a little slow and hesitant, which is likely related to your arthritis, as you mentioned. And your balance seems stable enough, although you are a bit unsteady, as you pointed out. Now, just a quick vision screening. Could you please read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Okay… let me see… E… F… P… T… V… I think that's it. It's a little blurry, you know? I can see them, but it's not sharp.
DOCTOR: Yes, your vision is a bit blurry, as you noticed. It appears to be consistent with your existing glasses prescription, but an update from your optometrist would be a good idea. Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, you’re generally in good health for your age. Your arthritis and slightly elevated blood pressure are the main things we need to keep an eye on. However, given the requirements for this medical card, I do have a few recommendations.
PATIENT: Oh good. What are they? I hope it's not too complicated. I just want to be able to drive, you know?
DOCTOR: It's not overly complicated, thankfully. First, I recommend scheduling an appointment with your optometrist for a comprehensive vision exam to ensure your prescription is up-to-date. Second, I'd like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week and keep a log of the readings. We can discuss the results next week. Finally, and this is the most important part, I’m going to write a letter to the medical review board outlining your health status and my assessment. I will state that you are medically fit to drive commercially with the understanding that you continue to manage your arthritis and monitor your blood pressure. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds reasonable. An eye appointment… and monitor my blood pressure… I can do that. My daughter has one of those blood pressure machines, I think. And you’ll write a letter? That’s good. Will that letter be enough? I don’t want to get all the way out there and then be turned away. This is for a job, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mrs. Sciarotta. It’s a valid question. The medical review board typically accepts a letter from a physician outlining the patient’s health status and assessment, especially when the patient meets the basic requirements. However, there is always a small chance they may request additional information. To minimize that risk, I will be very thorough in my letter, including all of your medical history, the results of today’s examination, and my recommendations for continued care. I will also include a statement confirming that you have no medical conditions that would impair your ability to drive safely. If they do request additional testing, we can certainly discuss it and proceed accordingly. But based on everything I’ve seen today, I’m confident that you'll meet their requirements. Would you like me to provide you with a copy of the letter once it's finalized?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. Just in case. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. It’s a lot to keep track of, you know? So, what do I do now? Do I need to schedule another appointment? Or do I just wait for you to write the letter?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Sciarotta. I’m happy to help. No need to schedule another appointment at this time. I’ll work on the letter today and have it ready for you within the next few days. My assistant will contact you to arrange a convenient time for you to pick it up. In the meantime, please schedule that appointment with your optometrist and start monitoring your blood pressure. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. It’s a weight off my mind, knowing I’m one step closer to getting this done. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sciarotta. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best with your job application.
