DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Really bothering me, especially at night. It's just… constantly needing a scratch.
DOCTOR: Constantly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. Not all day every second, but most of the day it's something. And like I said, at night is the worst. Keeps me up, you know? It’s not just one spot either, it’s… everywhere, really. Arms, legs, back… even my tummy a little.
DOCTOR: Everywhere… and has this been going on for a while, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started maybe a month or so ago, I'd say. Not terribly bad at first, just a little annoying. But it's gotten steadily worse, especially the last week or so. I thought maybe it was the laundry detergent, so I switched brands, but that didn’t help a bit.
DOCTOR: A month, progressing over the last week… and you've already tried switching detergents. That’s sensible. Are there any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always do. Lots of rice and beans, some chicken, you know, typical Puerto Rican cooking. Maybe a little more fruit this summer, it's been so hot. But nothing major different, no. I haven't started eating anything new that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any rashes or bumps associated with the itching?
PATIENT: Well, no, that’s the strange thing. It doesn’t look like anything is wrong. No rash, no bumps, no redness... nothing visible at all. Just… itchiness. That’s why I’m so confused! It’s driving me crazy, but there’s nothing to see. It feels like it's all under the skin, maybe? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: No visible rash… itching alone. I see. And have you had any fever, weight loss, fatigue, or any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, thank goodness. And my weight is pretty steady, maybe gained a pound or two with all the mangoes this summer! No more tired than usual, either. Just the itchiness, really. It’s just… frustrating. I feel like I’m imagining things sometimes, because there’s nothing to show anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look. Perhaps a physical examination will be more revealing. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just let me… careful now. Old bones, you know! I’ll lie right down for you. Is there a sheet I should…
DOCTOR: Yes, there's a sheet there. Just get comfortable. I’m going to examine your skin. Hmm… skin is warm and dry. No visible lesions, rashes, or excoriations. Capillary refill is normal. No edema. It is difficult to see anything, as you said. Your skin feels normal to the touch, but I can see you're uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It feels normal to me, too. But inside… it’s just this constant nagging. Hmm… I really appreciate you taking the time to look, Doctor. It’s just… worrying, you know? I haven't been sick in years, and I don't want something serious going on. Do you have any ideas what it could be?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Cassimatis, itching without a rash can be due to a number of things. Sometimes it’s as simple as dry skin, even if it doesn’t look dry. Other times, it can be related to nerve issues, medication side effects, or, less commonly, underlying medical conditions. Because you’ve tried addressing potential irritants already, and there’s no visible rash, we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some basic bloodwork – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel – just to rule out anything obvious. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as thyroid issues can sometimes present with itching. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Bloodwork is fine. I’d rather rule things out than wonder about them, definitely. Thyroid… you think that could be it? I haven't had that checked in… well, a long time, I suppose. As long as it’s not anything too serious, I’m okay with whatever you think is best, Doctor. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Thyroid dysfunction is just one possibility, Ms. Cassimatis. We're being thorough. The lab requisition will have instructions for fasting. It's important to follow those. The results usually take about 3-5 business days. I’ll have the nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day. And try to avoid anything that might further irritate your skin – harsh soaps, detergents, tight clothing. We’ll go from there once we have the bloodwork results. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Fragrance-free moisturizer… that sounds reasonable. Three to five business days… okay. Thank you very much for your time and for not dismissing it as “just dry skin.” It’s been really bothering me, so I appreciate you taking it seriously. I guess I’ll go see the nurse now to schedule the bloodwork?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will assist you with that. If you experience any significant worsening of the itching—fever, swelling, any changes in your skin—please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. We want to rule out anything serious. You may go ahead.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thank you again, Doctor. I will. And I'll keep an eye out for anything getting worse. Have a good day.
