DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...well, it's my stomach, mostly. I've been feeling quite sick to it lately, and I just don't seem to be able to eat much. Everything feels full so quickly, you know? It's been going on for a little while now...hard to say how long exactly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to feel a bit less clear as time goes on. We’ll take our time. So, this feeling of fullness… is it with every meal, or does it happen more often at certain times?
PATIENT: Oh, it's pretty much with every meal, I think. Even a little something... a biscuit or a piece of toast... it just feels like too much. And it doesn’t go away quickly. It just… sits there. It's not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And then, like I said, the sickness comes along with it sometimes. It's a bit of a mess, really. I've lost a bit of weight, I reckon. My clothes are feeling a bit looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fullness with even small amounts of food, lasting for a while, and occasionally accompanied by nausea. Weight loss as well. Do you experience any heartburn or indigestion alongside this, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Heartburn… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes. It’s not bad bad, but a little burning feeling up in my chest, especially after I try to eat something. And… I do burp a lot. More than usual, I think. It’s just… I've gotten used to a lot of little discomforts these days. It's hard to say what's new and what's just… old age. I'm Cherokee, you know. My grandmother always said our bodies tell stories. Sometimes it’s hard to understand what they’re trying to say.
DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful way to put it, Ms. Kelder. It is important to listen to what your body is telling you. And yes, understanding those stories can be…complex. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – anything different with your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a question. I...well, I try not to think about those things too much. Everything feels a bit…irregular, I suppose. Not diarrhea or anything, but not…normal either. Harder than usual, sometimes. And… less often. Does that make sense? It's all just a bit of a muddle, really. I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear. I just... it’s not things one discusses easily, is it? And, honestly, I've been so focused on the sickness and the fullness, I haven’t paid much attention.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Ms. Kelder. These things aren’t easy to discuss, and it's very common to not notice subtle changes. Irregular bowel movements alongside the other symptoms… alright. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss – would you say you’ve lost a significant amount of weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I think so. I haven't weighed myself, not for a long time now. But my daughter, she came to visit last month, and she said I was looking thinner. She brought me some new clothes, and they're a bit big. Not huge, but… noticeable. I used to weigh… oh, goodness, I can't even remember what I used to weigh! Somewhere around 130, maybe? But that was years ago. I mostly just eat soup these days. It's easier to keep down, you see. And it doesn’t take much effort. I used to love to cook, proper meals. But... it's all getting harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. We're gathering a good amount of information. Loss of appetite, feeling full quickly, nausea, occasional heartburn, irregular bowel movements, and unintentional weight loss. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, dear. I haven’t had any problems with food, ever. I take a little something for my arthritis, a white pill… can’t remember the name of it. It helps with the aching in my hands. And… that’s about it. I mostly just try to keep moving, keep active. My grandmother always said that was the best medicine of all. Though, these days, even walking to the mailbox feels like a chore. Is that important, Doctor? The arthritis, I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's helpful to know everything, Ms. Kelder. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to gently examine your abdomen to see if we can determine the source of your discomfort. It will be a quick, and hopefully, painless process. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds fine. I trust your judgement. My granddaughter, she’s a nurse, and she always says it’s important to let the doctor listen. Though, I’ve always been a bit… ticklish, you know. Especially around my tummy. But do what you need to do, Doctor. I want to feel better, whatever it takes. Just be gentle, if you wouldn't mind. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kelder. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any particular area that is more tender or uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's...it's mostly right here, I think. . It doesn't hurt exactly, but it feels...full. And a bit… heavy. And sometimes, when I press on it, I feel a little… ache. Just a little one. It's hard to explain. It's not sharp, or stabbing. Just...uncomfortable. Like there's something pressing on me. Does that make sense, Doctor? .
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Ms. Kelder. I do detect some mild tenderness in your left upper quadrant. There doesn’t appear to be any guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. No masses palpated at this time. Given your symptoms of early satiety, nausea, weight loss, and the tenderness I’ve detected, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work and an abdominal ultrasound to further investigate the cause of your discomfort. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Blood work and… an ultrasound? Sounds a bit… serious. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I trust your judgement. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it… something bad? I’m not good with all this medical talk, you see. I just want to feel better. It’s been a while since I’ve felt like myself. Is it my stomach, do you think? Or something else? I just...I've always been a worrier. My husband, bless his soul, he used to say I worried too much. .
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Ms. Kelder. It's my job to explain everything as clearly as possible. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying infections or deficiencies. The ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that allows us to visualize your liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen, and to identify any abnormalities. We'll be looking at your gallbladder in particular, as your symptoms could indicate gallbladder issues. It could also be related to your stomach, or even something else. We need to investigate thoroughly to get an accurate diagnosis. I want to assure you that we are taking this seriously, and we will work together to find the cause of your discomfort and develop a treatment plan that works for you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Sensible and thorough. Yes, that’s good. I’m glad you’re being thorough. My daughter, she always says I need to advocate for myself, be sure the doctors are listening. And you are listening, Doctor. That’s good. . So, blood work and an ultrasound, you said? When will that happen? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a tea party with the ladies next week, and I wouldn't want to miss it. It’s the annual wildflower theme. I promised to bring my elderflower cordial. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel comfortable with that plan. We can draw the blood work today, right here in the office. It will only take a few minutes. The ultrasound will be scheduled at the imaging center across town. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you, aiming for sometime this week if possible. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I think we’ll have the results back well before your tea party. In the meantime, I recommend trying to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid foods that seem to trigger your nausea, and stay well hydrated. If your symptoms worsen significantly, such as severe abdominal pain or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… manageable. Smaller meals, I can do that. And I’ll stay away from anything too rich. I used to make a lovely lemon cake, but I suppose I’ll hold off on that for a while. . No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. You've explained everything so clearly, Doctor. I just… appreciate you listening to an old woman's worries. . This is for you. It’s a little Cherokee blessing pouch, for good health and strength. My grandmother made it, years ago. .
DOCTOR: Oh, Ms. Kelder, that is incredibly thoughtful of you. Thank you so much. It’s beautiful. I will cherish it. Alright, let's go ahead and get that blood work done. The receptionist will handle the ultrasound scheduling. If you have any questions or concerns arise before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit better already, just knowing you’re taking it seriously. . Alright, let’s get this over with. . You’re a good doctor, you know. A very good doctor. My husband would have liked you. . Let's go.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That means a great deal to me. And thank you for trusting me with your care. Let's head to the lab, and we’ll take it one step at a time. .
PATIENT: .
