DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Umm… good mornin’. My… nails. They look funny. Not good funny, just… funny. I think they changed. I don’t really… remember when exactly. Just… look at ‘em. You’ll see.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. Yes, I see what you mean. They do appear a bit different. Can you describe how they’ve changed?
PATIENT: Changed… how? Hmm. They’re… thicker, I guess. And kinda… yellow. Not a nice yellow, like sunshine. More like… old paint. And one of ‘em… it’s kinda separated from the skin. Just a little bit, but it bothers me. I don’t do housework much, so it’s not from that. I don’t know why they're like this. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thut. I'm noting all of this. And you're right to be concerned. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… just… weird. Like a little somethin’s under there. Not sharp, just… present. It doesn’t hurt to type, and I do a lot of typin’ for… stuff. Important stuff. I just don’t like lookin’ at ‘em, ya know? Makes my fingers feel… dirty. Even when they're clean.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. It's good you're bringing this to my attention, even if it’s not painful. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Ummm… I get a little tired sometimes. Is that a condition? And my knees… they creak. Like an old door. But everyone gets old, right? I don’t really go to the doctor much. They always ask a lot of questions. I don't remember all the details of… things. Stuff. I have Medicare, though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Thut. We’ll take things slowly. Medicare is helpful, yes. Now, regarding your fatigue and knee creaking… have you noticed either of those getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. The knees… maybe a little. It rains a lot here, ya know? Makes everything ache. And the tired… always tired, really. But I sleep okay. Mostly. I don't think it’s… important tired. Just… regular tired. Like after a long day of… things. Important things. Look, are you gonna fix my nails or ask questions all day? I have appointments, ya know. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your appointments, Ms. Thut, and I want to get to the bottom of this. The changes in your nails could be due to a number of things – a fungal infection is common, but it could also be related to other underlying conditions. I want to make sure we rule those out. Before we jump to a treatment for the nails, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your skin elsewhere?
PATIENT: Skin? Elsewhere? Like… my arms? My legs? I don’t really… look at my skin. Too busy. Important busy. I put lotion on sometimes. Smells nice. But I don't notice anything… wrong. Everything feels kinda… normal. Except for these nails. They're definitely not normal. Just get me somethin’ for ‘em, okay? I don't want a whole… thing. Just fix the nails.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I understand. It's difficult to recall everything. Since you’re primarily concerned about the nails, and you haven't noticed any other skin changes, let’s start with a simple test to see if a fungal infection is the cause. I'm going to gently scrape a small sample from under the nail, and we’ll send it to the lab for analysis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Scrape? Like… with a knife? No! No scrapin’! That sounds… unpleasant. Can’t you just… give me somethin’ for it? Some polish or somethin’? I saw on TV where they have these special polishes… for nails. I don’t like things scraped off of me. That’s… barbaric. Just give me the polish. Please? I have important things to do. Really important things.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Thut. Scraping is a quick and relatively painless procedure, but it’s the best way to accurately identify the cause of the problem. While special polishes can sometimes help, they won't be effective if it’s not a fungal infection. However, I respect your wishes. Since you're so opposed to the scraping, we can try a topical antifungal medication as a first step. But I need you to understand that it may not solve the problem if the underlying cause is something else. Before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I think I sneezed a lot once when I was around… flowers. Does that count? And I don’t like the smell of… strong perfume. Makes my head hurt. But not an allergy, really. Just… dislike. No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anythin’. Just… important things. Like gettin’ my nails fixed. But I do get headaches sometimes. When I have to… think too much. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Thank you for letting me know. Since you don’t have any known drug allergies, we can proceed with a topical antifungal cream. I'm going to prescribe one for you to apply to the affected nails twice a day. It will take several weeks to see any improvement, as nails grow slowly. I also recommend keeping your nails trimmed short and dry, as that can help prevent the infection from spreading. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Trimmed short? My nails? But… they’re almost a respectable length! Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… give me the cream. And make it quick. I really, really have important things to do. And I’m not comin’ back if it makes ‘em worse. You hear? Worse. I'll just… find someone else. Important someone else.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Here's the prescription. I understand your concerns, and I hope the cream helps. If you don’t see any improvement after six to eight weeks, or if your condition worsens, please don’t hesitate to follow up with another doctor, as you mentioned. I’ve also included some information about nail care with the prescription. I wish you all the best. And thank you for coming in today. .
