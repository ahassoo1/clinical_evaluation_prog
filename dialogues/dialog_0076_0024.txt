DOCTOR: Right, Kiante Sayar. Thirty-three years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi Doctor Ruocco. It's… well, it’s a bit of an odd request, actually. I need a letter saying I’m okay to fly. I know it sounds strange, but an airline is asking for one.
DOCTOR: A letter to fly… Right. Airlines. Honestly, people come up with the strangest things these days. Well, alright. But I need to know why they're asking for this. Are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not at all! That’s the confusing part. Everything’s been… normal, I guess. It’s just… my husband passed away a few months ago, and I’m going to visit family overseas for the first time since then. The airline said something about needing confirmation from a doctor, just in case… something unexpected happened on the flight, I think? They didn't really explain it well. They just kept repeating "doctor's letter required." I really don’t know what they’re worried about.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A bereavement trip. And the airline is being…difficult. Look, I understand, but I'm a doctor, not a travel agent. Still, I suppose a quick check-up wouldn't hurt. Just to cover myself, you understand. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just… the usual colds now and then. Medicare covers my regular check-ups, but I haven’t needed anything serious done in years. I really just want to get this letter and go, if that's possible? I’ve already booked the flights, and I’m a little worried about losing my money.
DOCTOR: Right. "Pretty healthy." Everyone says that. Alright. Let’s do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure. And I’ll need to check your blood pressure. Don’t want anything… unexpected… happening thirty thousand feet in the air. Sit up straight, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine, but I understand you want to be careful. I appreciate that. Just… let me know if there’s anything I need to do. It’s just a little stressful, everything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Heart rate is… adequate. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, but nothing alarming. 110/70. Any history of dizziness or fainting?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a little bit. I get maybe a little tired sometimes, you know, normal life things, but definitely no dizziness or fainting. I’ve always been good with flying, actually. Before… well, before everything. I've flown a lot with my husband. No problems at all.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Husband. Well, these things happen. Look, it's probably just airline bureaucracy. But to cover all bases, I’ll write a note stating you’re medically cleared for travel, blood pressure is within acceptable limits, and you report no significant medical issues. Don't expect me to spend all day on this, though. It's a simple letter, not a full medical evaluation. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. That's good, right? Just the letter is enough? I really appreciate you doing this for me, Doctor. It’s a huge weight off my shoulders. My family is expecting me, and I was so worried about losing my flights.
DOCTOR: Here. This should satisfy them. One page. States you are cleared for travel. Don’t expect me to be responsible if you suddenly fall ill mid-air, though. I’ve documented your report of good health. That's all I can do. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor Ruocco! Perfect, that looks great. No, that’s everything. I really appreciate your time and help. Have a good day! .
DOCTOR: Right. You too. Try not to cause a medical emergency on the flight. People… honestly. .
