DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again. Keeps coming back, you see. And with it, these… water infections, the doctor calls them? They’re not pleasant, I can tell you that. It's been happening for a while now, on and off.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Pain in your side and recurring urinary tract infections. “On and off” is helpful – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well… the pain usually starts in my back, lower down on one side. Sometimes it feels like a dull ache, other times it’s a sharper, more stabbing sort of feeling. It comes and goes, like waves. And when the pain gets bad, that’s usually when I start feeling like I need to go to the bathroom all the time, even if there’s not much to go. That's when I know it's another water infection. It's been happening for… oh, goodness, a few years now, I suppose. Maybe longer. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few years of intermittent lower back pain on one side, that seems to correlate with urinary tract infection symptoms. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When you say “all the time,” roughly how often are we talking?
PATIENT: Well, when it's bad… every hour, maybe? Sometimes even more often than that. It's not a lot each time, you understand. Just a little bit, but the feeling is always there. It disrupts my sleep, mostly. I have to get up several times in the night. It’s quite tiring, to be honest. And then the pain… it makes it hard to concentrate on anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination – every hour or so when symptomatic, with small amounts, and disrupting your sleep. That does sound troublesome. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or fever, chills, or nausea with these infections?
PATIENT: Blood… sometimes, yes. Not a lot, usually just a tinge. It worries me when I see that. As for fever… I don’t think so. I haven't taken my temperature, but I don't feel hot, not usually. Sometimes I feel a bit weak, and a bit… shaky, like you said, but I wouldn't call it chills. Nausea… no, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Just generally unwell, you know? Tired and uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever or nausea, occasional blood in the urine, and general feelings of weakness and tiredness when these episodes happen. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… The doctor told me a while back… something about my kidneys. He said I had… lots of little pockets on them. Polycystic something? That's what he called it. I don't really understand it myself. He said it runs in the family, my mother had it too. Apart from that… no, I don't think so. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Just getting old now, I suppose!
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… okay, that’s important information. Do you know if the doctor ever discussed what stage of kidney disease you were at?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. He just said I had it, and that I needed to keep an eye on things. It was a long time ago, and I don't recall him mentioning stages or anything like that. He just said it could cause problems with my waterworks, and that's what’s been happening. I mostly just see the doctor when I get these infections, and he gives me something for them. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent follow-up for the polycystic kidney disease, and you've primarily been seen for these urinary tract infections. Do you know what medications you’ve been prescribed for those infections in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Usually, it’s a little white pill. Starts with a ‘C’, I believe… Cipro? Or something like that. Sometimes a different one, but that’s the one I remember the most. I take it for… usually about seven days, I think. It usually clears up the infection, but it always comes back eventually. I've been on it a few times now, over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, Cipro for the UTIs, taken for about seven days at a time, but recurring infections. We'll need to look at your records to see how often you've been prescribed antibiotics. Let me just take a look at your recent history here… Okay, I see several courses of Cipro over the last few years, as you said. I also see a note about a CT scan done five years ago showing… yes, polycystic kidney disease. The report doesn't mention staging. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. It’s a bit stiff, getting up and down these days. But I’ll manage. There you are. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, I'm just going to press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. Hmm… a little tenderness on your left side. And a bit more tenderness on your right side. Your kidneys feel a bit enlarged, which isn’t surprising given the polycystic kidney disease. Listening to your abdomen now… sounds are normal. Okay. Given your history of recurring UTIs, the tenderness in your flanks, and the polycystic kidney disease, I suspect the infections may be related to the cysts in your kidneys. We need to rule out a kidney stone, though. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a CT scan without contrast to get a better look at your kidneys and rule out a stone. Also, I want to get a blood test to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Anything to find out what's going on. A stone… oh dear. That doesn’t sound pleasant. Blood tests and scans, yes, alright. Whatever you need. I trust your judgement. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this pain once and for all. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. For the urinalysis, I’ll give you a container and instructions before you leave. For the CT scan, they’ll likely ask you to avoid eating or drinking for a few hours beforehand, but the radiology department will give you specific instructions when they schedule the appointment. The blood test just requires fasting for about 8-12 hours beforehand. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics to treat your current infection. It’s the same one you’ve been taking, Cipro, 500mg twice a day for seven days. And I'll send a referral to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – for further evaluation. They can help manage your polycystic kidney disease long-term. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Antibiotics and a specialist… yes, that's good. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s reassuring to know we’re finally getting to the bottom of this. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do on my end. And thank you again for your help. Now, about that container for the… what did you call it? Urinalysis?
DOCTOR: Yes, a urinalysis. This container. You'll need to collect a mid-stream urine sample – that means you start urinating into the toilet, then collect a sample mid-way through the stream. Try to be as clean as possible – wipe from front to back if you're female. And please bring it with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment, or drop it off at the lab before then. I'll have the nurse print you out instructions as well. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Start and stop, and collect the middle part. Yes, I can manage that. And I’ll get the instructions from the nurse. No, I don't think I have any other questions at the moment. Everything is very clear, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your help. I feel much better knowing we’re finally getting to the bottom of this. I hope the tests don’t take too long. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment now?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the test results. That gives the lab enough time to process everything. How does August 16th at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: August 16th at 10:00 AM… Yes, that’s perfect. That works very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you squeezing me in. And thank you to the nurse as well, for the instructions. I think that’s everything for now. I’ll see you on August 16th then. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. Have a good day, and please call if you have any questions before your appointment. And take it easy. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. .
