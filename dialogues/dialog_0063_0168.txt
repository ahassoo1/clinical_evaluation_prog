DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a situation. I’m dating someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things… progress. One has to be careful these days, you understand. It’s not like when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Prudent, yes. A sensible approach, though frankly, most people don’t bother. So, you’re concerned about sexually transmitted infections, I presume?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a concern, naturally. But it’s more than that. I want to be certain I’m… fit. You know, healthy enough for… intimacy. I wouldn’t want any unpleasant surprises. It’s a matter of respect, really – for both of us. And frankly, for myself. I maintain a certain standard.
DOCTOR: A “certain standard,” quite. Very well. Let’s begin with the basics then. Have you experienced any unusual symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms? Doctor, I assure you, I am quite attuned to my body. No… discharge, no rashes, no… odd smells. Everything functions as it should. Though, I have been a little more… fatigued lately. But that could be the heat, honestly. It’s been dreadful. And, truthfully, managing a household is… draining. It’s not as if I have assistance, you understand.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is remarkably non-specific, Ms. Pandolfi. Nearly everyone is fatigued. Have you had this fatigue for a prolonged period, or is it recent?
PATIENT: Recent, I would say. Perhaps the last… month or so. It's not debilitating, mind you. I still manage everything. But I do find myself needing an extra cup of tea in the afternoons. And a small nap on the weekends. It’s just… not my usual energy level. I used to be able to do so much more. I maintain a very active social calendar, you see. It's important.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Penicillin. A rather nasty reaction when I was a child. Swelling, hives… quite unpleasant. And I’m somewhat sensitive to artificial fragrances. They give me a headache. Honestly, the things they put in products these days… appalling. I prefer natural everything, when possible. It’s a healthier approach, you see.
DOCTOR: Penicillin, noted. And sensitivities to fragrances. Alright. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin for my knees, Doctor. They ache sometimes, especially in damp weather. And I take a multivitamin, naturally. One must supplement one’s diet. It’s rarely sufficient these days. I also occasionally take something for… digestive regularity. But nothing consistent. It’s as needed, you understand. I prefer to maintain a natural balance when possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. And your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. Chickenpox, measles… I had my tonsils removed when I was about twelve. And I was briefly diagnosed with… mild anemia in my twenties, but it resolved itself. I had a rather difficult pregnancy with my son, but he’s perfectly healthy now, thank goodness. Beyond that, nothing significant. I’ve always been rather… robust. I maintain a healthy lifestyle, you see. I do try.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, history of mild anemia… right. Any surgeries besides the tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I've always been fortunate in that regard. I believe in preventative care, you see. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise when I can, and I generally avoid risky behavior. I don’t believe in unnecessarily subjecting oneself to medical interventions. It’s best to maintain one’s natural constitution. And frankly, I’m a bit particular about who touches me. It’s a matter of principle.
DOCTOR: And your family history, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had high blood pressure, later in life. And my father… he had some heart trouble. Nothing dramatic, mind you, but it was there. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from arthritis. It runs in the family, I believe. Beyond that… fairly unremarkable, as far as I know. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of aging. It's…expected, you see. A natural consequence of time.
DOCTOR: And finally, your social history?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, I am dating. It’s… a new development. He’s… a gentleman. Quite respectable. We’ve been seeing each other for a few months now. I don't smoke, haven't for decades. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And as for… other activities, I prefer not to disclose such personal details. It’s rather… private. And frankly, irrelevant to this consultation, wouldn’t you agree? I came here for a check-up, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we have enough information for a basic assessment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. It will be quick.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A physical exam. I hadn’t anticipated… that. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I feel perfectly fine. But if you insist…. Just… please be gentle. And discreet.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Pandolfi. Now, if you could please lie supine. I’ll begin with auscultation of the heart and lungs. Heart rate is… within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh. Reflexes. Very well. . Just… be mindful. I've always been rather…sensitive. And do try not to be rough. It's quite unnerving, you know, having a stranger poke and prod. . Honestly, I don’t understand why this is necessary. I feel perfectly capable of assessing my own physical state.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally. Within normal limits. Throat is clear, no erythema noted. Ears are unremarkable. All right. That concludes the physical exam. It was… unremarkable. Now, considering your concerns and given your… aversion to further investigation, I suggest a basic STI screening. We can rule out the common culprits. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: STI screening. Yes, that would be… sensible. As long as it's discreet, of course. And I trust your lab adheres to the strictest confidentiality protocols? One can never be too careful these days. And please, Doctor, no unnecessary probing. I’ve already explained my… sensitivities. Just the basics, if you please. I’m not interested in a… comprehensive examination. . Honestly, I find this entire process rather…invasive.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order a standard panel for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, and HIV. The results should be available in approximately one week. A nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. A week, you say? Very well. I trust everything will be handled with the utmost discretion. And please, if there are any unexpected complications, I expect to be informed immediately. I have certain… standards, you understand. . Thank you for your time, Doctor. I trust this will be the end of this rather… unpleasant experience. . .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in touch. Have a… pleasant day, Ms. Pandolfi. .
