DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. My heart… it hasn’t been right for a while now, and I’ve got this cough that just won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for… oh, maybe a month or so now? It feels worse when I lie down, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, thank you for telling me. A month is definitely long enough to be concerning. Let’s talk about your heart first. Can you describe what “not right” feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to explain. It’s not a pain, exactly. More like… tired. Like it’s working too hard, even when I’m just sitting. And sometimes, I feel… short of breath, even doing simple things. Like walking to the kitchen. It’s been getting a little worse, slowly, you know? My husband, bless his soul, he used to say it sounded like a wheeze when I breathed. He passed two years ago, so I don't have him to listen anymore.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband, Nadene. That must be very difficult. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some concerning symptoms, and you’re right to get it checked out. So, to clarify, the tiredness and shortness of breath have been gradually worsening over the last month, alongside this cough?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The cough came on a little after, I think. Or maybe at the same time. It's hard to remember exactly. It’s a wet cough, if that makes sense. I have to spit up some phlegm sometimes. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It’s clear, usually, but sometimes it’s… a little yellow. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does matter, thank you for telling me. Clear or yellow phlegm can give us important clues. And a wet cough alongside the heart symptoms is definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything related to your heart or lungs?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I have. Let me think… the doctor, a long time ago, told me I had… congestive heart failure. That was maybe fifteen years ago? And high blood pressure, for sure. I take pills for both. I think I also had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when my son was little. But that was just the one time. I can tell you the names of the pills if that helps? I keep them in a special box.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Knowing about the congestive heart failure and high blood pressure is important. And yes, please, if you could tell me the names of the medications you’re taking, that would be great. Even a rough idea is fine. Also, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let’s see… for the heart, I take… Lisinopril, I think that’s right. And… a water pill, Furosemide, yes. That’s the one that makes me go to the bathroom a lot! And for the blood pressure, I take… Amlodipine, I believe. I try to keep track, but sometimes… well, you get old, and things get fuzzy. As for hospitals… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And the pneumonia, of course. Oh, and when I broke my hip about ten years ago. That was a bad fall. But nothing else, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Amlodipine. That’s good information, thank you. And knowing about the gallbladder removal and hip fracture is helpful too. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctors always ask, and I always tell them no. I've eaten everything, tried everything, you know? Never had a reaction. Although… I don’t like shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. It smells funny. And I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but my son has a cat now, and I’m used to it. It's just a little sniffle, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had heart problems, lung disease, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother, she had high blood pressure, just like me. And my father, he… well, he died of a heart attack when he was fairly young, maybe in his sixties. And my brother, he had… emphysema, I think it was. He smoked a lot, always did. I never smoked, thank goodness. My son, he’s healthy as a horse, though. Never had any problems.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Nadene. Knowing about your mother's high blood pressure, your father’s heart attack, and your brother’s emphysema is important. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I mostly stay at home. I used to be very active, loved to dance, but these days… it's hard. I watch a lot of television. And I cook, of course. I still cook for my son when he visits. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables, but I do like my sweets. A little bit of chocolate, you know? And I don't drink alcohol, never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold. My skin gets chilly easily these days.
DOCTOR: It might be a little cool, but I’ll make sure to keep it brief. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. I do hear a bit of a murmur, which isn't entirely unexpected given your history of heart failure. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some crackling sounds, especially towards the base of both lungs. Your blood pressure is 150/90, which is a little elevated, and your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is slightly lower than we'd like to see. Based on what you've told me, and what I've heard during the exam, it sounds like your heart failure may be worsening, and you may have some fluid buildup in your lungs. It's important that we investigate this further. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Fluid in the lungs… that doesn’t sound good. Is that why I’m so breathless? And the cough? I thought maybe it was just a cold. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Nadene. The fluid in the lungs, called pulmonary edema, is certainly contributing to your breathlessness and cough. It’s a sign that your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should. Whether or not you need to go to the hospital depends on the severity, and we need to do some further testing to determine that. I want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart, and also some blood tests to check your kidney function and levels of certain hormones that can affect your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An X-ray and some blood tests… alright. Will they be able to do that here, in the clinic? And how long will it take to get the results? I have to be home for my son, he’s bringing dinner.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do both the X-ray and blood tests right here in the clinic. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the blood test will just be a quick prick of the finger. The results should be available within a couple of hours. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood after our conversation, and we’ll review the results together before you leave. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a diuretic – a stronger water pill than you’re currently taking – to help get rid of some of the excess fluid. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A stronger water pill… oh dear. More bathroom trips, then? I already go so often! But, yes, if it helps, then alright. I’ll try anything to feel better. Will it interact with the other pills I’m taking? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and it's important to think about potential interactions. The diuretic I’m prescribing, Furosemide 40mg once daily, can interact with Lisinopril, which you're already taking. It can sometimes lower your blood pressure too much. So, we'll need to monitor your blood pressure closely, especially when you first start taking it. I'll also give you instructions on how to manage any potential side effects, like dizziness or weakness. The nurse will go over everything with you, and you can call us anytime if you have any concerns. We're going to take things one step at a time, Nadene. First the tests, then the results, and then we'll make a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. One step at a time. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. It’s good to know you’re taking everything seriously. And you’re right, it’s good to know someone is. So, the nurse will draw my blood and I’ll get the results in a couple of hours? And she’ll explain about the new pill? That’s good. I think… I think that’s all I need to know for now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. I'm glad I could reassure you. Yes, the nurse will draw your blood and explain everything about the new medication. She'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. I’ve asked all my silly questions, haven't I? I just… I just want to feel better. Thank you for listening, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Please, just let me know when the nurse is ready. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You haven’t asked any silly questions at all, Nadene. It’s my job to listen and help you feel better, and I’m happy to do so. The nurse will be with you in just a moment. Take a deep breath, and try to relax. We'll get this sorted out.
