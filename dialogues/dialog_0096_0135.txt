DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. My ear… it is having some liquid come out. It started, let me think… about three days ago, I believe. It is not painful, but… it is bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, liquid coming from the ear for three days now. Not painful, just bothersome. Hmm. Is it just one ear, Mr. Radillo, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left ear, Doctor. The right ear is perfectly fine, thank you. It is only the left one with the… the discharge, as you say. I keep having to wipe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left ear. And what does this liquid look like, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: It is… clear, mostly. A little bit yellow, sometimes. Not thick, like honey. More like water, but… not clean water, if that makes sense. A little… sticky, perhaps. I have not noticed any bad smell, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear to slightly yellow, watery, a little sticky… no bad smell. Good to know. Have you experienced any hearing loss or ringing in your ear along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My hearing… it is not as sharp as it was. It is difficult to explain. Things sound… muffled, in that ear. Like someone is covering it with a cloth. And yes, a little ringing. Not constant, but it comes and goes. Mostly at night. It is not very loud, but I notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing and intermittent ringing in the left ear. And has anything happened recently that might have caused this?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not that I can recall. I have not been swimming. I have not hit my head. I have not been sick with a cold or anything. It just… started. I was reading a book, and I noticed it when I wiped my face. Very strange, it is.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reading a book… Alright. Now, have you ever had any problems with your ears before, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young man, I had…an infection, I think. A very bad pain, and the doctor gave me drops to put in my ear. It went away, eventually. But this…this is different. No pain, just the liquid and the muffled sound. That was…many years ago, perhaps forty years ago. I have not had problems since then.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of an ear infection about forty years ago, resolved with ear drops. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a small pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. It is called… Amlodipine, I believe. I take it every morning. Otherwise, no. I try to stay healthy. And I do not drink alcohol or smoke.
DOCTOR: Alright, Amlodipine for blood pressure. That's good to know. Now, let's take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope. It might be a little chilly, but it shouldn’t hurt. Can you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I can sit up straight, no problem. I understand. I am ready when you are. I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright… Hmm. Yes, I see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum appears a little… dull. It’s not bulging, which is good, but there is definitely some inflammation. I also see some… cerumen, earwax, mixed in with the fluid. Left ear: moderate cerumen impaction with tympanic membrane inflammation and fluid present. I’m going to clean out the earwax first. Then we'll see if the problem is simply a blockage or something else. It might feel a little strange. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Clean out the earwax. If that is what you think is best. It might feel strange, you say? I am prepared for strange. I just want to be able to hear properly again. Yes, please proceed. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright, just going to gently remove this wax… There we go… Hmm. Still seeing some inflammation, even with the wax removed. I also see a little redness behind the ear drum. It could be a simple case of otitis externa - swimmer's ear, even if you haven't been swimming - but we need to rule out a middle ear infection. I'm going to order a tympanometry to assess the function of your eardrum and middle ear, and potentially a culture if it doesn't improve with initial treatment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tympanometry… and a culture? Yes, that…sounds very thorough, Doctor. If that is what is needed to find out what is wrong, then yes, it is acceptable. So, you think it could be this… otitis externa? Even without swimming? Is that serious? I apologize for all the questions, I just like to understand.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Radillo, questions are good. Otitis externa – an infection of the outer ear canal – can happen without swimming, it’s often caused by bacteria, sometimes from moisture or scratching. It’s usually not serious, but it can be very uncomfortable, and if left untreated, it can spread. The tympanometry will help us determine if the eardrum is functioning properly and if there's fluid buildup in the middle ear. For now, I’m going to prescribe you some ear drops – a topical antibiotic and corticosteroid combination. Use them as directed, and avoid getting any water in your ear for a few days. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, we’ll schedule a follow-up and discuss the results of the tympanometry. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. Ear drops and keep it dry. And a follow-up if it does not improve. I can certainly do that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I will be sure to follow your instructions carefully. Is there anything else I should be doing, or any signs I should look out for? I do not want to worsen the situation.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Here's the prescription for the ear drops. Avoid inserting anything into your ear canal – no cotton swabs, no fingers. If you experience any fever, increased pain, drainage of blood, or dizziness, contact us immediately. Also, watch for any hearing loss that gets significantly worse. We want to catch anything serious early. The tympanometry appointment is scheduled for next week, on Thursday at 2 PM. And just to reiterate, avoid getting water in that ear as much as possible. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is everything. You have answered all my questions, and I feel much better understanding what is happening. Thank you very much for your time and your thoroughness. I will follow your instructions and come in for the test next week. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. You’re very welcome. Just remember to follow those instructions, and don't hesitate to contact us if anything changes. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
