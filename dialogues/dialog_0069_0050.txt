DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Oh… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s this cough. Been… a long time now, this cough. Just a dry one. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… tickles and makes me… well, cough. I suppose that’s what brought me in. It’s bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-standing dry cough. I understand. And it doesn't produce any mucus or phlegm when you cough, just a tickling sensation?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. No… nothing coming up. Just… air. Feels like dust, maybe? Or… like something’s trying to get out, but can’t. It’s hard to explain. It’s been… a while, so my memory isn't the best anymore. But it's definitely dry. Not a wet cough, never has been.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what's going on, especially when it’s been going on for a while. And it’s perfectly alright if your memory isn’t what it used to be; we’ll take our time. Can you tell me approximately how long this cough has been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s a tricky one. Let me think… It feels like… a long time. Before… before my wife passed, maybe? No, before that even. Perhaps… five years? Ten? It's… it's been a good while, that's all I can say for sure. I really can’t be certain. It just… gradually got worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so at least five, potentially up to ten years. And it gradually worsened over time. That’s helpful. Besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I get… a little tired sometimes. But I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I figure some tiredness is to be expected. I used to be stronger, of course. And… sometimes I feel a bit short of breath when I walk up the stairs. But I haven't been up the stairs much lately. No… I don't think so. Nothing else really. Just the cough, and being… old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re able to recognize the difference between what might be expected with age and what feels new or concerning. The tiredness and shortness of breath are good things to mention, thank you. Now, have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of dust or fumes in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? No, never. My wife… she didn't like smoking. And I always thought it was a foolish habit. Fumes… well, I used to work on cars, Doctor. For a long time. Automotive repair, that was my trade. Lots of fumes, I suppose. Gasoline, oil, paint… all sorts of things. That was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking history, but significant exposure to fumes from automotive repair work. That’s important information. Now, I’d like to ask a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes – that you’re currently being treated for, or have been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s a long list, I’m afraid. I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I think I had high blood pressure too, for a while. And… arthritis, of course. Every old person has arthritis! As for lung disease… I don't think so. Never been told I had anything wrong with my lungs, except… well, sometimes when I catch a cold, it settles in my chest. But that’s just a cold! I don’t remember anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble managed with medication, high blood pressure, and arthritis. No known lung disease, but you sometimes experience chest congestion with colds. Are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I used to take a pill for my heart, a little white one. But the doctor… a different doctor, a few years ago… he said I didn’t need it anymore. And… sometimes I take something for the arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing regular, though. Just when it really bothers me. That’s about it. Honestly, Doctor, I forget half the time if I’ve taken anything or not!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you previously took medication for your heart, but it was discontinued, and you occasionally use over-the-counter ibuprofen for arthritis pain. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I eat most things. I used to get a bit of a rash when I touched poison ivy, but that was when I was a boy. And… I think I had a bit of trouble with penicillin once, a long time ago. A mild rash, nothing serious. But that was decades and decades ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible mild reaction to penicillin many years ago, and a history of a mild rash with poison ivy. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen levels, and just take a general look. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Go right ahead. I suppose you need to listen to see what’s going on in there. I always figured my lungs were getting a bit rusty, working on those cars for so long. Whatever you need to do, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Okay, taking a listen to your lungs now. Your breathing sounds a little diminished in some areas, especially towards the lower lobes. I do hear some mild wheezing, but nothing particularly alarming at this point. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but regular. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not critically high. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but we'll keep an eye on that. Overall, everything seems relatively stable, but the low oxygen and diminished breath sounds are something we want to investigate further. Do you feel any pain when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain when I breathe. It just feels… tight sometimes. Like there's something heavy on my chest. But no sharp pain, no. It’s just… a fullness, I suppose. And that little tickle, from the cough, of course. That's always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with breathing, just a feeling of tightness and the persistent tickle from the cough. Given your history of working with cars, the long-standing cough, the diminished breath sounds, and the slightly low oxygen levels, I'm concerned about the possibility of some underlying lung condition, such as chronic bronchitis or even some degree of emphysema. The fumes from automotive work can certainly contribute to these conditions. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. That will allow us to visualize your lungs and see if there are any abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray, you say? Hmm… Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose it can’t hurt. I’ve had X-rays before, when I broke my arm as a boy. Not a fan of the radiation, but… if it will help figure out what’s wrong with my lungs, then yes. Go ahead. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get an order for a chest X-ray right away. The technician will need you to remove any jewelry or metal objects from your chest area. It’s a quick and painless procedure. While we wait for the results of the X-ray, I’m also going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler. It will help to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe, especially if you experience any shortness of breath. It's safe to use, even if the X-ray shows nothing significant. Would you like me to explain how to use it?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator inhaler… that sounds… helpful. Open up the airways, you say? Yes, please, Doctor. Explain how to use it. I'm not very good with these newfangled things. I used to fix cars with my hands, not breathe into machines. So yes, please. Explain it slowly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. This is a simple inhaler. You’ll want to hold it with the mouthpiece at the bottom. First, you’ll shake the inhaler well – make sure you give it a good shake before every use. Then, you’ll take a deep breath, and as you start to inhale, you’ll press down on the canister – that’s this part here – to release the medication. Continue inhaling deeply and slowly, holding your breath for about ten seconds if you can. It’s important to exhale completely before taking a puff, and to rinse your mouth out with water after each use to prevent any irritation. We'll start with two puffs four times a day, and we can adjust the dosage if needed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Two puffs, four times a day… and rinse my mouth. That sounds… manageable. Shake it, breathe in, press down, hold… rinse. And exhale first. Right. I think… I think I understand. But I’m worried I’ll forget. My memory isn't what it used to be, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's perfectly normal to be concerned about forgetting. We can write down clear instructions for you, and I can also have the nurse go over it with you again before you leave. And don't worry, if you have any trouble, you can always call the office and we'll be happy to help. Once we have the results of the chest X-ray, we can discuss them in more detail and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, please use the inhaler as prescribed, and if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – like increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers it. The nurse going over it again would be… very helpful, thank you. And I will try to remember. Two puffs, four times a day. Rinse my mouth. Thank you for your help, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. It's my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. We'll get the nurse in to go over the inhaler instructions with you now, and we'll get the X-ray scheduled. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and help you breathe easier.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that.
