DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… need a check-up for a team tryout. Gotta make sure I'm still okay to play, you know? Don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand. A pre-participation physical. That’s a good idea. To start, can you tell me a little bit about the team you’re trying out for, and what position you play?
PATIENT: It's… a wrestling team. Local thing, mostly. I’m… well, I was a heavyweight. Been a while, though. Trying to get back into it. Don’t ask me how old the competition is, haha.
DOCTOR: Wrestling is quite demanding. And I won’t pry about the ages of your competitors. Now, have you been experiencing any pain or discomfort recently?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. A few aches, you know, getting older. But nothing I can't work through. Shoulders maybe a little stiff sometimes. But that's… normal, right? For someone my age?
DOCTOR: It’s common to have some age-related stiffness. However, we’ll want to assess it to be sure. Have you had any injuries in the past, specifically related to wrestling or any other sports?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A few sprains, mostly ankles. Back’s been tweaked a couple of times. Nothing serious, never needed surgery or anything. One concussion, years ago. High school, I think. Didn't even miss much time. I think I just got knocked silly for a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, sprains, back tweaks, and a concussion in high school. Good to know. And how would you describe your current overall health?
PATIENT: Pretty good, I guess. I try to stay active, walk a lot. Eat okay. Not perfect. Blood pressure was a little high last time I checked at the pharmacy, but… I forget what the numbers were. It wasn’t terrible, though. Just… noticed it was a bit red on the machine.
DOCTOR: Alright, a bit of elevated blood pressure noted at the pharmacy. We’ll check that today. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife… well, she had a bunch, but that was her. I’m pretty simple, honestly.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every once in a while. When I remember. Mostly forget. Don't bother with much else. Trying to keep it natural, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, just an occasional multivitamin. Alright, Mr. Kingan, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate – and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also want to assess your range of motion and check for any tenderness in your joints, particularly your shoulders and back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got things to do. Don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, as you mentioned. Heart rate is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear. Now, could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Is that good? I haven’t really… been to a doctor in a while. Hope I'm doing this right.
DOCTOR: Good. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you please raise both of your arms above your head, as high as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ow… yeah, there we go. A little stiff… feels like something's catching. Not bad bad, just… there. It’s been like this for a while. Don’t think much of it. It’s my shoulders, you know. Old wrestling injury, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see a slight limitation in your range of motion and some discomfort with abduction and flexion. Now, can you rotate your shoulders – forward and then backward?
PATIENT: There… yeah. That’s a little tighter too. Feels… crunchy, almost. Like a bad hinge. I really should probably stretch more. But… I just don’t. Is that bad? You're making me nervous.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” but it does indicate some joint stiffness and potential underlying issues. Now, let’s check your back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes, if you can?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s about as far as I go these days. My back’s… not what it used to be. Feels a little tight, a little pinched. Doesn’t really hurt, just… uncomfortable. Is everything okay? Are you seeing something bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. I do note some limitations in your forward flexion and some mild discomfort. And I feel some mild tenderness along your spinal muscles. Okay, Mr. Kingan, based on the exam and your history, it appears you have some age-related joint stiffness in your shoulders and some mild lower back discomfort. We need to investigate further. I recommend an X-ray of your shoulders and lower back to rule out any underlying arthritis or structural issues. Additionally, I’d like to order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any other potential causes of your discomfort. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ugh… X-rays and blood work? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. Look, Doctor, I just need to know if I'm okay to wrestle, you know? Is it gonna stop me from trying out? Can't I just… take some ibuprofen and stretch more? I don’t want to put a lot of money into this if it's not gonna make a difference. I'm not a professional, it's just a hobby. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and time commitment, Mr. Kingan. However, it's important to have a clear understanding of what's going on with your body before you engage in a strenuous activity like wrestling. Simply taking ibuprofen and stretching may temporarily relieve some discomfort, but it won't address any underlying issues. Without an accurate diagnosis, you risk exacerbating a potential injury. Given your insurance status, we can discuss options for more affordable imaging and blood work. The clinic has some programs to help. As for whether this will stop you from trying out, that depends on the results of the tests. If everything comes back normal, we can discuss a safe stretching and strengthening routine to help you prepare. If we find something, we'll discuss appropriate management options. Would you like me to connect you with our financial counselor to explore those options?
