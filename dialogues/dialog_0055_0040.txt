DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. My name is Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly. And… the waterworks, if you know what I mean. Seems to happen quite a bit, actually. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's starting to get a bit tiresome.
DOCTOR: I see. “Pain in the side” and… difficulties with urination. For how long has this been occurring, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It comes and goes, you see? But I’d say… on and off for about a year now. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to keep track when it flares up then quiets down. The waterworks seem worse when the pain is bad, though.
DOCTOR: A year, on and off… And when the pain is present, can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… ache, deep down. Like a constant dull throb, mostly on my right side. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, like something’s full or… heavy. It doesn't come in waves, it just is, you know? And it can be quite uncomfortable, especially when I move around.
DOCTOR: An ache, deep and constant on the right side, with a sensation of pressure. Do you notice anything specific that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Nothing really makes it better, to be honest. Resting helps a little, I suppose, but it doesn't make it go away completely. As for worse… drinking a lot of fluids seems to bother it sometimes. And… well, when I’m constipated, it’s definitely worse. Everything feels all… jammed up, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Constipation exacerbates the pain, and increased fluid intake sometimes aggravates it. I see. Now, concerning the “waterworks” as you put it… are you experiencing any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, sometimes there is. Not every time, but often. It's like a stinging sensation, you know? And I have to go very frequently, even if I’ve just been. It’s… embarrassing to talk about, but it’s a nuisance, to say the least. And sometimes, the urine looks a little cloudy, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, frequent urination, and cloudy urine. I’m noting all of this, Mr. Espinueva. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And thankfully, no vomiting. I’ve had a little bit of nausea a couple of times, but it’s not… strong, if you know what I mean. Just a bit queasy sometimes, nothing to write home about. It usually passes quickly. I haven't felt properly sick, just… unwell.
DOCTOR: No fever, chills, or significant nausea. Just a slight queasiness. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, my doctor told me a while back that my kidneys aren’t quite what they should be. Something about little… sacks of fluid, she called them. She said it’s something I was born with, and there’s not much they can do about it. Polycystic… something. That’s the name, I think. Other than that, I’m fairly healthy for my age. No diabetes or high blood pressure that I know of. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… I see. And do you recall when you were diagnosed with that, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago now. Maybe fifteen years? Something like that. It was during a routine check-up. She said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much, just something to keep an eye on. I've had regular check-ups since, of course, but… it hasn't really bothered me until recently. I suppose this pain might be connected to that, eh?
DOCTOR: Fifteen years ago. Very well. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, no surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a child, but that was just a cast and a sling. I’ve been in the hospital a couple of times for the flu when I was younger, but nothing major. Nothing in the last… twenty years, at least. I'm a fairly sturdy old man, you see. Mostly. This kidney business is the biggest thing, I reckon.
DOCTOR: No surgeries or major hospitalizations. Now, Mr. Espinueva, regarding your family history—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as kidney disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a tricky one. My mother, she had problems with her blood pressure when she got older, I believe. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had some sort of kidney trouble, but I don't remember the details. We weren't a family that talked much about health, you see. It was more… keep calm and carry on, if you know what I mean. So I'm not sure about much else. It wasn't something we discussed openly.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension in mother, possible kidney trouble in uncle. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. It's called… Naproxen, I think. A small white tablet. And sometimes I take a little bit of paracetamol for aches and pains, but not very often. That’s all. I don't really believe in taking too many pills, you see. Natural remedies are best, if you can find them. Though this pain is getting a bit beyond natural remedies, I fear.
DOCTOR: Naproxen for arthritis, occasional paracetamol. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I'm not one for being fussy, you see. And I spend most of my time indoors, so not much in the way of environmental factors, either. I'm a fairly simple man, Doctor. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, I'd like to conduct a physical examination now, if you don't mind. This will involve listening to your abdomen and back, and gently pressing on your stomach to check for any tenderness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I’m just hoping you can figure out what’s causing this pain. It’s starting to wear me down, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Now, take a few deep breaths for me. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. I'm noting some mild tenderness in your right flank, and your abdomen is slightly soft. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. I’ll listen to your back now. Your lungs are clear to auscultation. Alright, that’s all for now.
PATIENT: Right, thank you, Doctor. That wasn’t too bad at all. A little bit of poking and prodding, but nothing I couldn't handle. It's good to know my lungs are clear, at least. What do you think is causing all this trouble, then? Is it definitely my kidneys?
DOCTOR: Based on your symptoms and the physical examination, your long-standing history of polycystic kidney disease is certainly a strong possibility. The tenderness in your right flank is concerning, as that's where the kidneys are located. However, the urinary symptoms—burning and frequency—could also suggest a urinary tract infection. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. To rule out an infection and get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count. These tests will help us assess your kidney function and identify any signs of infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to go along with. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. It’s been a nuisance for too long. So yes, a urine analysis and a blood count sounds perfectly alright. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab should have the results within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids—water is best—unless it exacerbates the pain, as you mentioned. Avoid sugary drinks and caffeine. And continue taking your arthritis medication as prescribed. If you experience a fever, chills, severe back pain, or inability to urinate, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly, Doctor. Plenty of water, avoid sugar and caffeine, continue with the arthritis pills, and go to the emergency room if things get worse – fever, chills, bad pain, can’t pee. I've made a mental note. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your time and attention. Hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. I think that's all for now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Espinueva, that is all for now. We will be in touch with the results as soon as they are available. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for your help. Have a good day yourself. .
