DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Bloating. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, honestly. Waste of time, usually. But my wife – well, was my wife – she always said… never mind. It’s just, I feel puffed up, okay? Like a balloon. It’s uncomfortable. Can we just get this sorted?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to apologize for not being a regular doctor's visitor – everyone has their own reasons. “Puffed up,” you say… uncomfortable bloating. Alright. And when did you first start noticing this bloating, Lawton?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really remember. A few weeks, maybe? It all kinda blends together these days. It’s not…sharp pain, just…full. And gassy. Look, is this going to be a long thing? I got things to do. I'm a pile driver operator, you know? Can’t be stuck in here all day.
DOCTOR: Right, a pile driver operator. Good to know. A few weeks of fullness and gas… I understand wanting to get this sorted quickly. It can be a quick visit, we’ll see. Okay, so it’s been going on for a few weeks, not sharp pain, just fullness and gas. Has anything specific made it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Specific? Not that I’ve noticed. I eat what I eat. Steak, mostly. Sometimes chicken. I don’t really… fuss with food, you know? It’s fuel. I haven’t changed anything in my diet recently, not intentionally. Maybe… beer? I do have a couple with dinner. But I always have a couple with dinner. Does that even matter? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, so steak and chicken, a couple of beers with dinner – no recent changes there. It could matter, yes, but we’ll get to that. Just trying to build a picture here. Now, Lawton, aside from the bloating and gas, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Look, I'm not a complainer. I work hard, I get the job done. I don’t sit around cataloging every little… feeling. But… now that you mention it… I guess I've been a bit… tired. More tired than usual. But, you know, life's tiring. And my stomach… it's kinda been… rumbling more. Like, a lot. Is that a symptom? Honestly, I just want this fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and increased stomach rumbling along with the bloating and gas. I appreciate you telling me even though you’re not one to complain. It's good information. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do we have to talk about this? Look, I’m a grown man. This is… personal. But fine. Yeah, they’re… softer than usual. And… more frequent. Happy now? I told you I don't do this whole… medical thing. Can we just get a pill or something? This is a waste of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lawton, I understand your frustration, and I’ll try to be as quick as possible. Softer and more frequent bowel movements. Alright. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. Look, if there was blood, I'd be at the hospital, not here complaining about a bit of bloating! And weight loss? I haven’t weighed myself in… years. Probably. I eat plenty. Steak, remember? I haven't exactly been slimming down. This is getting ridiculous. I feel like I'm being interrogated. Is this normal for a doctor's visit?
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in the stool, no unintentional weight loss. I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Lawton. I just need to rule out anything serious. Now, let’s go through some quick basics. Any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had a problem with anything. And medical conditions… not really. Had a bad back once, from lifting, but that's it. Pile driving isn’t exactly gentle work, you know. My wife… she always kept track of all that stuff. I honestly can't remember. Private insurance, though. Good insurance. Does that matter? Just trying to speed this up here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, no significant medical history. Good insurance is always helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… antacids sometimes. When the heartburn gets bad. From the beer, probably. And… honestly, that's it. I don't believe in loading up on pills. Makes you feel worse, usually. Look, can we please talk about what’s wrong with me, and what I need to do about it? This is getting absurd.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lawton. Antacids as needed for heartburn. Okay. Now, just a couple more questions, then we’ll move on. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Are you kidding me? I work around heavy machinery all day. One spark and… no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she hated smoking. Look, this is all very basic stuff, isn’t it? I'm a reasonably healthy man, despite the bloating. I just want to feel normal again. Can we just skip the rest of the questions and get to a solution? I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Alright. And finally, any family history of stomach problems, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… Look, my family is… complicated. Lots of people. From Somalia, mostly. We weren't exactly keeping detailed medical records back then, okay? My wife... she tried to piece some stuff together, but… honestly, I don't remember. There was something with her grandfather, I think? Stomach issues? But I honestly can’t be sure. I’m telling you, this is a waste of time. Can we just… send me home? I'll try some of those antacids. It can't hurt, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lawton. Vague family history of possible stomach issues. Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check for anything unusual. It won't take long. Then, based on everything you've told me, we'll figure out what might be going on and what steps we should take. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is a complete waste of my afternoon. Just… hurry, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lawton, take a few deep breaths for me. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem a little… hyperactive. Increased activity. And your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, particularly in the lower left quadrant. Not alarmingly so, but worth noting. Now, based on what you’ve told me – the bloating, gas, softer stool, increased frequency, tiredness, and the findings from the exam – it's possible you’re experiencing symptoms related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. The beer and steak could be contributing factors, as those can be triggers for some people. It’s also possible it’s something simpler, like a temporary digestive upset. However, given the increased frequency and the tenderness, I want to rule out anything more serious. Would you be comfortable getting a stool sample tested, just to be sure?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? You want me to… collect that? Look, I'm a pile driver operator, not a… lab technician! Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. But… fine. If it gets me out of here faster, okay. Just tell me what I need to do, and let’s get this over with. And please, don’t make me explain this to anyone. This is humiliating.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lawton, I completely understand your discomfort. It’s not the most pleasant thing, but it’s a standard test. I’m going to give you a collection kit and instructions. It just involves collecting a small sample – a couple of tablespoons – and bringing it back to the lab. The front desk can give you details on how to submit it. In the meantime, I recommend trying a bland diet for a few days – things like rice, toast, and bananas – to see if that helps. Also, cutting back on the beer and steak might provide some relief. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, it's important to follow up with us immediately. And once we get the stool sample results, we can discuss further steps if needed. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Bland diet, less beer, less steak… it sounds awful. But okay. Just… let me get this kit and get out of here. And please, don’t call me if I don’t call you. I'll manage. Just… this whole experience has been a complete waste of time. I need to get back to work. Where's the front desk?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lawton. The front desk is just over there . They can schedule a time for you to drop off the sample and answer any questions you may have. I understand your frustration, and I apologize again for any discomfort. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. And please, don’t hesitate to call us if you experience any concerning symptoms, like severe pain, fever, or blood in your stool. Even if it’s just to ask questions. I'm Derell Polczynski, and I'm here to help. Get back to work safely, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
