DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, I just moved here… with my husband. And I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? It’s… a social thing, I guess? Medicare said I should. I don’t really… remember much about finding one.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Establishing care with a primary physician is an excellent idea, and often a requirement with Medicare. We're happy to help you get that set up. So, even though you don’t have a specific ailment today, we can use this visit to go over your medical history, do a basic check-up, and ensure you’re all set for routine care. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Medical history… hmm. I don't really… know where to start. I kinda have trouble remembering things. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Emileigh. Many people find recalling medical details challenging. We'll take our time, and I'll guide you through it. We can also look through any records you might have, if available. It's perfectly fine if you need a moment to think about things, or if you need me to ask specific questions to jog your memory. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any significant past medical conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I think I had… the chickenpox when I was little? And maybe… strep throat? It was a long time ago. I don't remember much else. I've been pretty healthy, I think. I just… don't really remember being sick a lot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. Chickenpox and strep throat are common childhood illnesses. It’s good to know you haven’t had any serious or ongoing medical problems. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my tonsils out when I was little? But I was so young… my mom probably told me that. I don’t really remember it myself. Hospital… no, I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. Sorry, I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Emileigh. It's perfectly normal to not recall details from childhood. We're simply gathering information, and you've provided helpful answers so far. Let's move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Yes, both of them. They’re… back home. My mom… she has some trouble with her heart, I think. And my dad… he has diabetes. But he takes medicine for it. Does that matter? I don’t really know what kind of diabetes it is.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Emileigh. Knowing about your parents’ health is important. Heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father are both relevant to your overall health assessment. We may want to discuss some preventative screenings down the line. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had diabetes, heart disease, or any other significant medical conditions like cancer?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma, on my mom’s side, I think she had cancer? But it was a long time ago. And… my uncle, I think he has high blood pressure? But I don’t really know much about it. It’s… a big family, and I don’t really keep track of everyone’s… stuff. Sorry. It’s just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's common not to have a complete medical history of all family members. You've given me some very useful information. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never have. I don’t like any of that. My husband doesn’t either. We both try to stay healthy. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Emileigh. That’s a very healthy choice. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes vitamin D in the winter. The doctor back home said I was a little low. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think I’m allergic to bee stings? I got stung when I was little and I got really itchy and swollen. But other than that… no, I don’t think so. I can eat pretty much anything. Unless… something I haven’t eaten yet? But I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh. That’s a very thorough overview. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s… fine. What will you do? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We won’t be doing any blood draws today. I'll start by checking your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and briefly examine your abdomen. It's a fairly standard check-up. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also within the normal range. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Everything looks good so far. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good. It doesn't feel too bad. So, what now?
DOCTOR: Next, I’d like to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat, just to make sure everything looks healthy. Your ears look clear. Your nasal passages are also clear. Your throat looks healthy as well. No signs of any infection or inflammation. Finally, I'll just palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal. Overall, everything looks good, Emileigh. This initial exam doesn’t reveal any immediate concerns. It sounds like you’re in good health! Now, do you have any specific concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not really. I guess I was just worried about… everything. You said everything looks good, right? So, what happens now? Do I need to come back? Or… what do I do? I don’t really want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything looks good, Emileigh. You're in good health overall. And that’s excellent! Because this was an initial wellness visit, and you're currently healthy, I recommend a follow-up appointment in one year for a routine check-up. We can repeat this exam, and review any concerns that may arise. I also recommend you establish care with a local dentist if you haven’t already. Routine dental check-ups are important for overall health. Given your family history of diabetes, it may also be helpful to monitor your blood sugar levels annually, and maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on healthy lifestyle choices?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be great. I try to eat healthy, but… it's hard sometimes. And my husband and I… we walk sometimes, but not enough. So, just come back next year? And see you then? That’s… okay. Thank you, Doctor. You made me feel a lot better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could help. I'll print out some information on healthy eating and exercise routines for you. I’ll also schedule your follow-up appointment for next year, around the same time. Here’s a card with my contact information, should you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Do you have any further questions for me today, or are you all set?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Quicksey. You’ve been very helpful. I think I’ll go home and relax now. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It was a pleasure meeting you. Enjoy your day, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
