DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit…strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak and tired lately, and my skin and eyes are kind of yellow. It started a few days after I ate some fava beans. I love fava beans, but now I’m wondering if they had something to do with it.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness, fatigue, and yellowing of the skin and eyes – that’s jaundice, and it’s good you’ve noticed these symptoms. And you mentioned this started shortly after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Maybe two or three days after. I hadn’t eaten them in a while, and then I had a big plate of them with dinner. It seemed like a normal dinner, but then a couple of days later I just started feeling…off. And then I noticed the yellowing. It’s a little scary, to be honest. I don’t usually get sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Haggar. It is good you're paying attention to these changes. The timing with the fava beans is noteworthy. There’s a condition called Favism, which is a genetic deficiency where people can have a reaction to fava beans, causing this type of symptom presentation. To get a clearer picture, let's go through a bit more detail. Could you describe the weakness you're feeling?
PATIENT: Okay, Favism… I’ve never heard of that. Well, the weakness… it’s not like a muscle weakness, exactly. More like…everything feels heavy? Like I have no energy to do anything. Even just getting out of a chair feels like a big effort. And I get tired really easily. I used to be able to walk for miles, and now I’m winded just going up the stairs. It's just… draining. I also feel a little bit dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a general feeling of fatigue and heaviness, with some dizziness as well. That’s helpful. And you mentioned the dizziness – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s not every time I stand up, but it happens sometimes, especially if I get up too quickly. And it doesn’t last very long, usually just a few seconds. It’s not a spinning kind of dizziness, more like…lightheadedness, like I might faint. But I haven’t actually fainted yet. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Haggar. Lightheadedness, especially with quick movements, is good information. Now, let’s move onto other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it. Let me think… My urine seems normal, I think. As for my stool… it’s been a little paler than usual, maybe? Not dramatically, but…yes, I think it’s lighter. It’s usually… well, a normal brown, and now it's more of a… clay color, I guess you could say. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Ms. Haggar. Pale stools are another key symptom we need to investigate. And thank you for noticing and remembering these details. Now, let's briefly touch on your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life, honestly. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. I don’t take any regular medications, either. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. And…oh! I do have a mild allergy to dust, but that's about it. It just makes me sneeze a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history, appendix removed in adolescence, and a mild dust allergy. That’s helpful. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit tricky, Doctor. My family is mostly in Romania, and we haven't seen each other a lot since I moved. I know my grandfather on my mother's side had some heart problems, but I don't know much more than that. I don't think anyone else had anything…serious. It's hard to say, really. We didn’t really talk about health much. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Haggar. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially with distance and limited communication. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a receptionist at a small office, mostly sitting at a desk. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of vegetables and fruit. I don’t smoke and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to go for walks a lot, but I haven’t been feeling up to it lately, obviously. I live alone and I don’t have any pets. I try to stay active, but it’s been difficult with how tired I’ve been.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Haggar. That gives me a good overview. Given your symptoms – the weakness, fatigue, jaundice, pale stools, and the connection to the fava beans – Favism is a strong possibility, but we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to perform a physical exam now, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and examine your skin for any further signs of jaundice. Then, I’ll order some blood tests to confirm the diagnosis and assess your liver function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, and I trust your judgement. The blood tests sound a little scary, but if it helps figure things out, then I’m okay with it. Please let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Haggar. I appreciate your trust. There's no special preparation needed for the blood tests, just try to remain relaxed. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, that would be helpful. I’ll gently palpate your abdomen as well. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any sharp pain. I’m noticing some tenderness in your upper right quadrant. That area corresponds to your liver. Your skin does indeed appear slightly yellow, as you mentioned. Now, let’s get those blood tests ordered. I'll have the nurse draw them shortly. They will check your complete blood count, liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and a specific enzyme called G6PD, which is low in people with Favism. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. I felt a little tenderness there too, so it doesn’t surprise me. It’s good you noticed it. Checking for that G6PD enzyme… that sounds like a good idea. I’m happy you’re being so thorough. I’ll just lie here and try to relax while you get everything ready. Please just let me know if you need me to do anything. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Haggar. While the lab results are pending, I would advise you to avoid foods known to trigger hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency – fava beans being the most prominent. We’ll also want to review any medications you've taken recently to ensure they don't exacerbate the condition. I'll have the nurse bring you a list of medications to avoid. In the meantime, are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: No, I’m not experiencing any pain right now, thankfully. Just the tiredness, mostly. And a little bit of dizziness if I stand up too quickly, but nothing severe. Avoiding fava beans won’t be a problem, I definitely won’t be eating those again anytime soon! I’ll be sure to check the medication list carefully. It’s just… worrying, a little. Is it serious, Doctor? I mean, if it is Favism, is it something I can manage? I just want to understand what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Haggar, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious. Favism, while potentially serious, is generally manageable with appropriate avoidance of triggers. The severity can range from mild to severe. In most cases, it presents with symptoms like yours – hemolytic anemia, meaning the red blood cells are being destroyed faster than they can be replaced. The key is avoiding fava beans and certain medications. We’ll monitor your blood counts closely. If your levels drop significantly, we may need to consider a blood transfusion, but that's not likely in your case at this stage. We'll know more once we have the G6PD enzyme results. We’re taking this step-by-step. The blood tests will give us the definitive answer, and we’ll create a plan based on the results. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: That's…reassuring, thank you, Doctor. Knowing it's manageable makes a big difference. A blood transfusion sounds scary, but I understand. I think… I think I'm okay for now. Just waiting for the results, I suppose. Maybe I should ask… is this something I could pass on to my children, if I had any? It’s probably a silly question. I just… I always worry about these things.
DOCTOR: That is not a silly question at all, Ms. Haggar. It’s a very important and valid concern. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked genetic condition. This means it's carried on the X chromosome. If you carry the gene, there’s a 50% chance you would pass it on to your sons, who would be affected, as they only have one X chromosome. Daughters have two X chromosomes, so if they inherit the gene from you, they'll likely be carriers, like you, but may not show symptoms. However, it's important to remember that genetic inheritance is complex. We can discuss genetic counseling in more detail if you'd like, to help you understand the risks and options if you're planning to start a family. But let’s focus on getting a diagnosis and managing your current condition first. The nurse should be here shortly to draw your blood. We’ll let you know as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have anyone who can drive you home?
PATIENT: Yes, my neighbor offered to drive me. That’s a relief. Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Doctor. It’s good to know, even if it’s a little scary. I think…I think I’m okay for now. Just waiting for the results, and trying not to worry too much. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. This has been…a lot.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Haggar. It is a lot to process, and I’m glad I could help clarify things. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any further questions or concerns arise. We’ll take it one step at a time, and we’ll get through this together. The nurse will be in shortly. And please, focus on resting. .
