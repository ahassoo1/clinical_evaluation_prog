DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Patty is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up, that's what the nurse said, anyways. Been feelin' a little tired too, but I’m ninety years old, so what can ya expect?
DOCTOR: Of course, Patty. It’s good to know you have a sense of humor about things. High blood pressure is very common, but certainly something we want to investigate and manage appropriately, even at any age. And feeling tired is a valid symptom as well. To start, could you tell me a little more about this blood pressure issue?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t rightly know much about it. The lady at the pharmacy kept sayin' it was high when I went to get my usual medicine. Then she told me I needed to come see a doctor. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. I mostly just take my pills and try to stay busy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Patty. It’s quite common for high blood pressure to be discovered during a routine check at the pharmacy. Don’t worry about not knowing much about it; that’s what I’m here for. To help me understand what's been going on, could you tell me which pills you are currently taking, if you know their names?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. There’s… this one for my arthritis, the yellow ones. And this little white pill, I think that's for my water. And… oh dear. There’s a whole bunch here. I just take 'em like the man at the pharmacy tells me to. I don’t really keep track of names. He puts 'em in these little bags for me every month. Is that helpful? I’m sorry I can't be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Patty. It's very helpful just knowing which pills you're taking. It’s common to have a lot of medications, and it can be difficult to keep track. I see here you have… let’s see… Ibuprofen for arthritis, Hydrochlorothiazide, which is a water pill as you mentioned, and…Amlodipine. Do you know if you've ever had any allergic reactions to medications?
PATIENT: Allergic reactions…? Hmm. Not that I recall. I’ve taken pills most of my adult life, and never had a rash or nothin'. My mama always said I was a tough Cherokee girl. But… now that you mention it, sometimes when I take the white pills, my ankles get kinda puffy. Is that… an allergic reaction? Or just old age again?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Patty. Ankle swelling can be a side effect of the Hydrochlorothiazide, the water pill, or it could be related to other things. It’s important to investigate. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and the ankle swelling?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my head feels a little swimmy when I stand up too fast. And I’ve been a little more short of breath lately, even just walkin' to the mailbox. I thought it was just 'cause it's been so hot this summer. I do get a bit winded easy these days. But I guess that comes with bein’ old.
DOCTOR: Those are important things to mention, Patty. Dizziness when standing up and shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion, definitely warrant further attention. It's good you brought those up. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had the flu real bad when I was a little girl, almost didn’t make it. And I broke my hip a few years back, had to have a new one put in. Aside from that… not much. I've always been a strong woman. I was raised on Cherokee medicine and good living. We didn't go to doctors much. Oh! And I had a bad case of pneumonia when my husband passed away. That was a hard time. But I recovered. I always do.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been through a lot, Patty. Recovering from a hip replacement and pneumonia are both significant events, and it's wonderful that you’ve always recovered so well. Did your husband have any medical problems that ran in the family?
PATIENT: Oh, my William… he had a touch of the sugar sickness, they called it. Diabetes, I think the doctor said. And his heart wasn’t too strong towards the end. He passed away peacefully in his sleep, thankfully. He was a good man. A strong man, like his mama. We didn’t have much, but we had each other. I don't know much about what ran in my family, honestly. My mama mostly used herbs and natural remedies. We didn’t keep records like folks do these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Patty. Knowing about the diabetes and heart issues in your husband’s family is helpful, though. And I understand about not having detailed records – many families didn't keep those back then. Now, before we proceed, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Well, I ain’t ever had no allergies, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I ain't never had a reaction to poison ivy or nothin'. Oh! Except for bee stings. I got stung when I was a little girl, and it swelled up somethin' awful. But that was a long time ago. Haven't been stung since. I try to stay away from bees. They don't bother me, and I don't bother them.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Patty. A bee sting allergy is important to document. And finally, just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the ones we’ve already discussed?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! This little one. My granddaughter, Sarah, gave it to me. She says it's for my memory. Something about ginkgo biloba? I take one every morning with my breakfast. She says it'll help me remember things. I guess we’ll see about that!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Patty. It’s good you’re taking care of your memory! Ginkgo biloba can sometimes interact with other medications, so it's important to know you're taking it. Alright, Patty, I think I have a good understanding of your medical history now. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain’t afraid of a little checkin’. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m a pretty good patient, usually.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Patty. You’re already a very helpful patient. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is what prompted the nurse to ask you to come in. Your heart rhythm is slightly irregular, but it doesn’t sound concerning at this point. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. I also notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. I’m going to document these findings, Patty. Now, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your symptoms to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Do you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath when you lie down?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no chest pain. And I sleep pretty good, actually. I usually sleep with a pillow under my head, and that helps. I don't have any trouble breathin' when I’m lyin’ down. But sometimes, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I gotta get up and go to the bathroom. Happens a couple of times a night, usually. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Patty. Needing to urinate frequently at night, or nocturia, is quite common, but we'll want to consider it as we figure things out. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… things ain’t as clear as they used to be. I gotta hold things closer to read, and the print seems kinda blurry sometimes. I been meanin’ to go to the eye doctor, but I just haven’t gotten around to it. It's hard to keep up with everything when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Patty. Changes in vision are common with age, and it’s good you’ve noticed it. We can discuss getting a referral to an optometrist if you’d like. Now, one final question for now. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Hmm… not really. I think I might’ve lost a pound or two, but that could just be from the hot weather. I don’t have much of an appetite these days, but I eat when I’m hungry. I don’t weigh myself regular, so I couldn’t say for sure. I’m mostly just glad I can still enjoy a good slice of pie now and then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Patty. Alright, based on everything you’ve told me and the physical exam findings, I think it’s likely you’re experiencing high blood pressure, possibly contributing to some mild heart rhythm irregularities and ankle swelling. Your symptoms of tiredness, occasional dizziness, and nocturia could be related to this as well. Your vision changes are something we should investigate separately with an eye exam. I’m going to order some blood work and a urine test to get a better understanding of your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes. I’ll also order an EKG to further evaluate your heart rhythm. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? And maybe get a good night’s sleep. So, yes, let's do those tests. The sooner the better, if you ask me. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Patty. I completely understand. We'll get this sorted out. I'll have my nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample. She’ll give you instructions on how to prepare for the urine test – it's just a standard sample you'll provide when you come in. The EKG is quick and painless - just some stickers placed on your chest. I'll have the results sent to me within a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss a plan for managing your blood pressure, which may include lifestyle changes or medication. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water, eating a healthy diet, and trying to get regular, moderate exercise, if you’re able. And try to limit your salt intake, as that can raise your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything pretty well. You’re a good listener, and you explain things nice and clear. I reckon I'm in good hands with you. When should I expect to hear back? And where do I go for those tests?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Patty. That means a lot to me. The nurse will take you back right away to draw the blood and collect the urine sample. She’ll also schedule the EKG for you, likely within the next day or two. I'll review the results as soon as they're available, and my office will call you with the findings and schedule a follow-up appointment. You can expect to hear back within 3-5 business days. Here’s a copy of your lab orders and a summary of what we discussed today. It also includes information about managing your blood pressure. Do you have any other concerns or questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I’m all set for now. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to an old woman like me. I appreciate your kindness. You have a good day now, and thank you again.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Patty. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to take care of yourself. You have a wonderful day as well.
