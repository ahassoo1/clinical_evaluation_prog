DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my mother, she... she had some bad things. Heart, mostly. And my brother, he got… something with his brain. I just… want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s very sensible of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems and neurological issues. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about your mother’s heart condition?
PATIENT: She… she got tired a lot. Very tired. And then her legs… they puffed up. Real big. She went to the hospital a lot, and then… then she just stopped. It was quick. I think it was… a failure, the doctor said. Something about pumping? I don’t… I don’t remember all the words. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds very difficult, Mr. Schwer. And it's understandable you wouldn't remember all the medical details after so long. That sounds like it could have been congestive heart failure. And your brother’s condition – do you recall what “something with his brain” was?
PATIENT: He… he started forgetting things. Small things at first. Where he put his keys, what he ate for breakfast. Then… bigger things. He didn’t know who I was sometimes. It scared everyone. He… he got worse and worse. The doctors said… something about his memory? And then… well, he couldn’t move much at the end.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly challenging for your whole family. It sounds like he may have been experiencing some form of dementia, though I’d need more information to be sure. Okay. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let’s focus on you. Are you experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: No… not really. I get tired sometimes, but… who doesn't? I’m seventy-three! And my legs… they bother me a little when I stand for too long. But I just sit down. I haven't forgotten anything... yet. I just… want to be sure. It’s silly, maybe.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mr. Schwer. Being aware of your family history and wanting to be proactive is very responsible. And it's perfectly normal to experience fatigue and leg discomfort as we get older. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well… I had the flu a few times, like everyone. And my back, it acts up sometimes. Old injury. I saw a doctor for that years ago. He gave me some pills. I don’t take them anymore. They didn’t do much. And… I had my shots, you know? For… everything. That’s about it, I think. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no major illnesses, just some back pain and typical age-related aches and pains. And you're up-to-date on your vaccinations, which is excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I… I’m too scared of hospitals. Bad memories. That’s why I don’t go. My mother… well, you know. And my brother… too many sad things. I just… try to stay healthy. Walk a little, eat okay. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. Those experiences can certainly make it difficult to want to seek medical attention. It's admirable that you've been managing your health on your own. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Like I said, I don’t really take pills. My doctor years ago gave me something for my back, but it didn't help, so I stopped. I don't like taking things if I don’t need them. And I try to eat good food, so I don’t need vitamins, I think. Just… regular food.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current medications or supplements. That’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. And I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I think. I mean, maybe a little itchy sometimes when I get bitten by a mosquito, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I'm pretty tough, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… what? Oh… you mean… my life? Well… I was married, a long time ago. Divorced now. No kids. I used to work… selling things. Wholesale. Lots of driving. Retired now. Mostly just stay home, watch TV, walk around. Quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, quiet life, retired, divorced, no children. Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. My mother… she smoked a little, but I didn't like it. Bad smell. And bad for you, everyone said. I always stayed away from it. And I don't drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine sometimes with dinner, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to hear. Now, Mr. Schwer, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure. That’s fine. As long as it’s quick. I don’t like being poked and prodded too much. Just want to make sure I’m okay, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't be anything extensive. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s faint, but worth noting. Lungs sound clear. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal range for your age. And finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your feet and legs. I notice some mild swelling in your ankles, and your skin is a little dry. That’s common as we get older. Overall, everything seems reasonably normal for your age, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur are things we should monitor.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds… okay. What does it mean though? Is something bad happening? The swelling… is that like my mother?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking those questions, Mr. Schwer. The swelling in your ankles is mild, and not nearly as significant as what your mother experienced. It could be related to a number of things – simply standing for long periods, diet, or even the weather. We’ll want to keep an eye on it. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we should address, as uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to heart problems over time. The murmur I heard is likely benign, but it’s worth investigating further with an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of the heart. This will give us a clearer picture of your heart’s structure and function. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Echo… what? Ultrasound… you mean like for babies? And… investigating? That sounds… scary. Is it something serious? My brother… he had lots of tests. It didn’t help him.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Mr. Schwer. An echocardiogram is similar to the ultrasound used during pregnancy, but we’re looking at your heart instead. It's a non-invasive test – that means it doesn’t involve any needles or surgery – and it’s very safe. It helps us see how well your heart is pumping, the size of the chambers, and if there are any valve problems. And I understand your concern about tests, especially given your brother’s experience. But this isn’t necessarily the same. We’re doing this as a precaution – to get a baseline and make sure everything is functioning properly. It’s better to be proactive and catch any potential problems early, if they exist. We’re not assuming there is a problem, just being thorough. Would you like me to explain the echocardiogram procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes… please. What will they do? And how long does it take? I don't like being stuck in hospitals for too long. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Of course. The echocardiogram usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You'll lie on your left side on an examination table, and a technician will apply a gel to your chest. They'll then use a small handheld device called a transducer to send sound waves through your chest. The sound waves create images of your heart on a monitor. It doesn’t involve any radiation or electricity. You won't feel anything during the procedure – it’s completely painless. The technician will be able to see the images of your heart in real-time. They may ask you to take a few deep breaths during the test to get better images. The entire process is very safe and comfortable. After the test, you’ll be able to go home immediately. We’ll review the results with you at a follow-up appointment. Does that sound a little less daunting?
PATIENT: Okay… a little. No needles, you said? And no being stuck there all day? And… what if it is something bad? What then? Will I need… pills? Or… surgery? I don’t want surgery.
DOCTOR: No needles, that's right. And you won't be stuck there all day. The procedure itself is relatively quick. As for what if it is something bad… it’s best not to jump to conclusions until we have the results of the echocardiogram. If we do find something, the treatment options will depend on the specific condition. It could range from lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, to medication to help manage blood pressure or cholesterol. Surgery is always a last resort, and we would only consider it if absolutely necessary. We would discuss all of your options with you in detail, and you would be involved in every step of the decision-making process. We’ll work with you to find the best possible solution for your individual needs. Right now, let’s focus on getting the echocardiogram scheduled and see what the results tell us. Would you like me to have my nurse schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Yes… please. That would be good. Just… not too far off. I don’t want to wait too long. And… can I ask one more thing?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. You can ask anything. I’ll have my nurse schedule the echocardiogram for you as soon as possible. Let me see… the earliest appointment we have available is next Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, that’s okay. But… will they tell me what they find right away? Or will I have to wait? I hate waiting. And… can I bring someone with me? My neighbor, Mrs. Peterson, she’s very good with doctors.
DOCTOR: That's good. Tuesday at 9:00 AM it is. The technician won’t be able to give you a definitive diagnosis right away, but they will give a preliminary report to our office. I will personally review the results and contact you within a few days to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. And absolutely, you can bring Mrs. Peterson with you. Having someone there for support is always a good idea. It’s helpful to have an extra set of ears, and she can help you remember any questions you might have. My nurse will give you all the necessary information when she schedules your appointment, including any preparation instructions for the echocardiogram. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. I was very worried, but I feel a little better now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could ease your worries. Remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
