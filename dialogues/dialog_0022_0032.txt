DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… a rather delicate matter, actually. Something of an… inconvenience. I’m not entirely sure what is happening, to be frank. It’s been… discharging, you see. A bit embarrassing, really, to have to discuss this with a… a younger man. My wife suggested I come, of course. Women always do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It can be difficult to discuss these things, and you've done the right thing by coming in. We see this quite often, so please don't feel embarrassed at all. When you say "discharging," could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s… a fluid, naturally. A bit… yellowish, I suppose. Not a great deal of it, thankfully. It’s mostly… when I use the facilities. And sometimes… afterwards. It hasn’t been painful, not precisely. More… irritating. A slight… burning sensation, perhaps. It’s been going on… oh, goodness, I don’t rightly recall when it started. A few weeks, at least. Possibly longer. My memory isn't what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, a yellowish fluid discharge, mostly with urination and sometimes afterwards, with a slight burning sensation. And you estimate this has been happening for a few weeks, possibly longer. That’s helpful. Just to clarify, is this discharge from your urethra – the opening where you urinate – or is it coming from somewhere else?
PATIENT: Goodness. The… urethra, you say? Is that… that little hole? Yes, I believe so. It’s definitely from there. Though, to be honest, Doctor, I haven’t spent a great deal of time… examining the particulars. My wife would be most displeased if I started poking around down there. She handles all that sort of thing, usually. A very practical woman, my Zahra. Though sometimes… a bit too much so.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It’s good you have someone who helps with these things. Knowing it’s coming from the urethra is helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit… tired lately. But at my age, Doctor, aren't we always tired? And perhaps a little… more frequent trips to the facilities than usual. Just a little. I wouldn’t say it’s alarming. No fever, no… discomfort elsewhere. Just the discharge, the slight burning, and a general sense of… well, old age. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mr. Krok. Increased frequency of urination and fatigue, alongside the discharge and burning. Old age isn’t a symptom in itself, but it’s good you’re telling me everything you’re experiencing. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Zahra has been trying to get me to eat more fruit, you see. Says it’s good for… everything. I suppose I’ve been eating a bit more fruit. As for weight… I haven't stepped on the scales in ages. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not concerned with such trivial matters. I’ve always been a… slender man. And I’ve certainly lost none of my… discerning taste. Perhaps I’ve gained a little, but it’s likely just the fruit. Good, ripe peaches, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant changes in appetite, and possibly a slight weight gain due to increased fruit consumption. Now, have you had any recent sexual activity?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor! That is… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Zahra and I… we have been married for a very long time. Let’s just say our… activities have diminished somewhat with age. It’s… not as frequent as it once was. Certainly not recent. Why do you ask? Is this… is this common? I thought this sort of thing was… associated with younger men, and… other pursuits.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard question, Mr. Krok, and I apologize if it made you uncomfortable. We ask to rule out certain possibilities. It’s good to know. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted infections? Good heavens, no! Zahra and I have been… discreet, shall we say, throughout our marriage. We’ve always been very careful. Such things are… unsavory, and frankly, beneath us. I assure you, Doctor, I’ve never had anything of that sort. My family has a good reputation, you know. A very good reputation indeed. I wouldn't dream of exposing myself, or my wife, to such… ailments. It's simply not done.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… well, Zahra manages all that, you see. She’s very good with the doctors and the… the paperwork. I believe I have… slightly elevated blood pressure, she tells me. But nothing serious. She gives me a little pill every morning. And sometimes, she says my kidneys aren't quite as… vigorous as they used to be. But again, nothing to worry about. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. I think I had a touch of the flu last winter, but that hardly counts, does it? I mostly just rested and drank a lot of tea. Zahra made a lovely ginger tea. She has a remedy for everything, that woman. Absolutely everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slightly elevated blood pressure managed with medication, and some mild kidney issues. And a bout of the flu last winter. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I believe I had my appendix removed many years ago. When I was quite young, actually. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… oh! I had a cataract operation a few years back. My vision wasn’t what it used to be, you see. But that went very well. Dr. Ahmadi was excellent. And… I think I was briefly hospitalized for a bout of pneumonia when I was in my fifties. But that was a long time ago. Nothing significant lately, thankfully. Zahra handles all the details, as I said. I mostly just try to stay out of the hospitals. Dreadful places, hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in youth, cataract surgery a few years ago, and a bout of pneumonia in his fifties. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Zahra has a little chart, you see, with all my pills. It’s quite comprehensive, actually. Besides the blood pressure medication… I take something for my… joints, she says. They ache sometimes, particularly in the cold weather. And… oh! Yes, a little something for my… prostate. It’s… an old man’s ailment, she says. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, she gives me a little pill for that as well. It's mostly just little things, Doctor. Nothing serious. She’s very careful to ensure I take everything properly. Honestly, keeping track of all the pills is quite a task. I leave it entirely to Zahra. She’s much better organized than I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for blood pressure, joints, prostate, and occasionally for sleep. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been a rather robust man, generally. I can eat just about anything. Zahra occasionally tries to get me to eat… kale, I believe it’s called. Disgusting stuff, kale. But I don’t have an allergy to it, just a strong aversion. I recall being slightly itchy after eating a particular type of shellfish once, many years ago. But it could have been anything, really. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction, thankfully. Zahra is very careful about what she gives me. She wouldn't risk giving me anything that might cause a problem. She’s a very cautious woman, that Zahra. And a very good cook, mostly. Except for the kale.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Krok, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Goodness. Well, I suppose so, Doctor. But please, be gentle. I’m not as… resilient as I once was. And I'd prefer not to… undress completely, if possible. Is that alright? I’m a rather modest man, you see. And I haven't been examined by a doctor in quite some time. Zahra usually handles these things, you see. She’s very thorough. But I suppose if you insist… just please be quick about it. And gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. We can certainly keep your clothing on as much as possible. I understand your discomfort. I’ll just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to take a quick look at the area where you’re experiencing the discharge. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please, do hurry. And be gentle. This is… not my favorite activity, you understand. I always preferred Zahra’s examinations. She’s much more… discreet. And she doesn’t poke and prod quite so much. Just let me know when you’re finished, alright? I have a rather important appointment with my garden later this afternoon. The tomatoes need tending. Tomatoes are much more pleasant than this, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur, which is common for someone your age. No concerning irregularities. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, if you could just loosen your trousers slightly, I’ll take a quick look at the area. Remember, you can stop me at any time. I'm just looking for any signs of inflammation or discharge. I see some mild redness around the urethral opening, and a small amount of clear discharge is present. No significant swelling or lesions. Okay, that was quick. I’ll need to send a urine sample to the lab to check for infection. Everything seems relatively straightforward, but we’ll need the lab results to confirm.
PATIENT: Goodness, that was… quick indeed, Doctor. I’m rather relieved it’s over. A urine sample, you say? How does one… procure a urine sample? I haven’t done that in years. Zahra usually handles these things, you see. She has a special container. And she always makes sure I’m properly… hydrated. Will this be… uncomfortable? I have a rather delicate constitution, you understand. And I really must get back to my tomatoes. They’re quite demanding, you see. Tomatoes are much more reliable than doctors, frankly.
DOCTOR: It's very straightforward, Mr. Krok. I’ll give you a sterile container and instructions. You simply need to collect a small sample of your urine in the container. We have a restroom just down the hall. I'll explain how to collect a "clean catch" sample – that just means wiping the area clean before collecting the sample to avoid contamination. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. And yes, it’s best to be well-hydrated before collecting the sample – that makes it easier. Here’s a pamphlet with detailed instructions. Do you have any questions about the process?
PATIENT: A "clean catch" sample… Goodness. It sounds rather complicated. Zahra always said I was… mechanically inclined, but this… this seems a bit much. “Wipe the area clean”… with what, exactly? And how much… is enough? I wouldn’t want to… underperform, you understand. It wouldn’t be a good look. Perhaps… perhaps you could simply take a look yourself? I mean, wouldn’t that be easier? I’m sure Zahra would understand. This is much more trouble than it’s worth, frankly. Tomatoes don’t require “clean catch” samples.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your hesitation. It's perfectly alright to feel a bit uncomfortable with this process. We need the urine sample to get an accurate diagnosis, and it really is quite simple. You’ll just need to use a clean wipe – I can provide one – to gently clean the area before collecting the sample. As for how much, about two ounces is sufficient – about half a cup. It doesn’t need to be perfect. I cannot visually assess the urine without a sample, and that would not provide the information we need. We want to be thorough and accurate, and the lab results will give us the best understanding of what’s going on. I can step out while you collect the sample, if that would make you more comfortable. Just let me know when you're finished, and we can discuss the next steps. We’re here to help you feel better, Mr. Krok, and we’ll make this as easy as possible.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please, do hurry. And step out, if you would be so kind. I… I prefer a bit of privacy. Zahra always said I was a… modest man. Just… just let me know when you’re ready. And please, don’t rush me. This is… rather delicate, you understand. Tomatoes don’t require sterile wipes or privacy, frankly. It’s all very unnecessary.
