DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My… assistant, I suppose, scheduled this. Something about not being able to see or hear properly. It’s terribly inconvenient, you understand. I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re experiencing some difficulty with your vision and hearing, but weren’t aware of needing an appointment specifically for those issues?
PATIENT: Well, not specifically. Things just… aren't as sharp as they used to be. And noises seem… muffled. It’s probably just age. Honestly, I don’t have time for a full investigation. Is there something quick you can prescribe? Something to… sharpen things up? I have very important work to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re busy, Ms. Julie. However, simply prescribing something without a proper assessment isn’t responsible care, and could potentially be harmful. To determine the cause of your vision and hearing changes, I'll need to ask a few questions and then perform a brief examination. Let's start with your vision. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Questions. Really? Honestly, it’s all a blur. Perhaps… a few weeks ago? Maybe months. I’m a surgeon, Doctor, not a record keeper of my… sensory experiences. It’s gradual, I assure you. Nothing sudden or alarming. I just noticed things weren’t quite… pristine. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Gradual" is a start. Has this impacted your ability to perform surgery?
PATIENT: Impact? No, absolutely not. I am a highly skilled surgeon, Doctor. I manage perfectly well. One simply… adjusts. I don’t need my vision to be perfect to know where to make an incision. It's about… technique, you see. Not staring intently at things. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… insulting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. However, it's my professional responsibility to ensure your safety, and that includes assessing any potential impact on your work. Even subtle changes can be significant. Let's move onto your hearing. Are you having difficulty understanding conversations?
PATIENT: Honestly, everyone mumbles these days. It's the youth. No enunciation. And people speaking so quickly! It's not my ears, Doctor, it's everyone else’s lack of proper diction. I do find myself asking people to repeat themselves occasionally, yes, but that's hardly a medical emergency. It's terribly annoying, of course. A professional courtesy, really, that they should speak clearly.
DOCTOR: So, difficulty understanding speech, attributing it to others’ enunciation. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or fullness in either ear?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about sounds? Really. I suppose… occasionally a slight… hum? It’s probably the fluorescent lights in the hospital. Everything makes a noise these days. It’s just background static. I haven’t paid it much attention. And I certainly don't have time to dissect every little sensation. Are we getting anywhere with this? Because I have a waiting room full of children.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your busy schedule, but this information is important. Let’s briefly review your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Doctor, I am a surgeon. Do you honestly think someone in my profession would allow themselves to be riddled with ailments? I maintain a very strict regimen. Excellent diet, regular exercise… the usual. I barely have time to get sick, let alone develop “chronic conditions.” Next question, please. I’m losing valuable operating time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries yourself?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, is this relevant? Fine. A hysterectomy, decades ago. And… a rather minor cosmetic procedure on my face. A lift, if you must know. It was… preventative. And I assure you, neither has any bearing on my current… sensory inconveniences. Are we done yet? I have patients waiting, and frankly, this is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, while I respect your accomplishments, dismissing potential contributing factors to your health concerns isn't productive. It's my responsibility to investigate thoroughly. Now, regarding family history… are there any instances of hearing loss or vision problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, dear Lord. My mother was rather… vain. Lots of cosmetic work. And my father… well, he was a politician. He ignored everything. As for hearing loss or vision problems… I suppose someone, somewhere, probably had something. It’s a family, Doctor, not a meticulously documented medical study. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a surgeon! I fix people. I don’t analyze their genealogy for vague predispositions. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, with all due respect, I'm concerned about your refusal to provide basic medical information. And frankly, your dismissive attitude is hindering my ability to assess your condition. I'm going to recommend a formal audiological evaluation and a comprehensive ophthalmological exam. I'll write you the referrals. I strongly advise you to schedule these appointments as soon as possible. In the meantime, I advise you to refrain from any complex surgical procedures until these evaluations are completed. Your safety, and the safety of your patients, is paramount. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision or hearing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
