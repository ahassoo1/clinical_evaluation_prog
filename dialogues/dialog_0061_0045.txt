DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mr. Withycombe! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my face. It gets… red. A lot. Especially when I eat. Or sometimes, even just thinking about food. It’s been happening for a few months now, maybe six? It’s not painful, just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your face gets red, especially with eating or even thinking about food, and it’s been going on for about six months. Not painful, just bothersome. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When you say “red,” can you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s not like… a rash. Not bumpy or anything. Just… the whole face gets warm and the skin turns very, very red. Like… if you spend too long in the sun, but faster. And it goes away after a little while. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes? It's hard to say exactly. Sometimes it's worse than others. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it's more of a flushing – warm and red across the whole face, comes on quickly, and fades after about ten to fifteen minutes, and the intensity varies. Okay. And does anything else seem to trigger it, besides eating or thinking about food?
PATIENT: Thinking about food is strange, yes? I don’t even want to eat sometimes when it happens! Let me think… Um, sometimes when I get… upset. Not angry, exactly. More… flustered. Like if someone is talking loudly, or if I'm trying to remember something and can’t. Also… hot drinks. Tea, mostly. Not coffee. And… oh! When I bend over. That makes it much worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, we have eating, thinking about food, getting flustered or upset, hot drinks like tea, and bending over as triggers. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really. I had my gallbladder out, maybe fifteen years ago? But that was a long time ago. And… high blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but it wasn’t very high. He said to watch my salt. I try to. Mostly. No big problems, really. I used to be very strong, but… not so much now. My wife… she used to take care of all that.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. Okay, so you had your gallbladder removed fifteen years ago and were told you had slightly elevated blood pressure. You try to limit your salt intake. Do you take any medications currently, for the blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no medications. The doctor just said to watch the salt and try to walk more. I… haven’t been walking much lately. It’s hard. And my wife… she always reminded me. Now… it's easy to forget. I don’t think I need anything, really. It’s just my face. Embarrassing, but not… dangerous, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And you haven't been as active recently. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat almost anything. My wife, she was very careful about that. Always asking if something was cooked with nuts, or if it had shellfish. I never had a problem. I can eat spicy food too, which is good. She liked it mild, so I always had to add the chili powder.
DOCTOR: Good to know, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Withycombe, this is all very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and take a look at your face more closely. That will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop. It's… unsettling. Makes me not want to go out.
DOCTOR: I understand, and we'll do our best to figure it out. Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. Not drastically high, but something we should keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a closer look at your face. I see some redness on your cheeks and nose, but no rash or any other noticeable changes. Is it usually this red, or does it get more pronounced when you’re experiencing the flushing?
PATIENT: It's usually more red. Like… tomato red, almost. When it happens. Right now it’s… mild. I came here before it started. Sometimes, it spreads to my neck and ears too. It’s… quite noticeable. People stare. That's the worst part.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it gets significantly redder – tomato red, even – and spreads to your neck and ears when it's happening. That definitely sounds concerning. Based on what you've told me, and the initial exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called Rosacea. It’s a common skin condition that causes facial redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, pus-filled bumps. Triggers like eating, heat, alcohol, stress, and bending over are common. The elevated blood pressure could also be contributing. However, other conditions could cause similar symptoms, so it's important to rule those out. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any other possible causes. I also recommend a dermatology consult – a skin specialist can provide a more definitive diagnosis and recommend the best treatment plan. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a skin specialist? That sounds… complicated. But okay. If you think it’s best. What kind of blood tests? And… will the skin specialist need to… poke at my face? I don't like doctors poking at me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. It can feel overwhelming, but we’ll take it one step at a time. The blood tests are fairly standard. We’ll check your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. It’s just to get a baseline and rule out any underlying issues that might be contributing to the redness. As for the dermatologist, they might visually examine your face very closely, and they might need to gently touch it to assess the skin texture, but it shouldn't be painful. They'll explain everything before they do anything. They are the experts and can best determine the cause and most effective treatment. Would you like me to write you a referral to a dermatologist now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A referral would be good. And… is there anything I can do now? Before I see the skin specialist? Anything to make it… less noticeable? I have a friend’s birthday party next week, and I don’t want to… embarrass everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma – she's a wonderful dermatologist right here in the city. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage the symptoms. Avoid your triggers: As much as possible, try to avoid things that seem to bring on the flushing – hot drinks, spicy foods, alcohol, stress, bending over. Gentle skincare: Use a mild, fragrance-free cleanser and moisturizer. Avoid harsh scrubs or exfoliants. Sun protection: Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, even on cloudy days. Keep a diary: Write down when you experience the flushing, what you ate or did beforehand, and any other relevant factors. This can help you identify your specific triggers. I'm also going to prescribe a topical cream called Metronidazole. It's a mild antibiotic that can help reduce redness and inflammation. It won't cure the condition, but it can help manage the symptoms. I’ll also give you a handout with more information about Rosacea and skincare tips. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very helpful, Doctor. A diary… I think I can do that. And the cream… I hope it doesn't smell too bad. I don’t like strong smells. Thank you. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. The Metronidazole cream has a very faint scent, most people don’t even notice it. If you find it bothersome, let me know and we can explore other options. Here are the prescription for the cream, the referral to Dr. Sharma, and the handout about Rosacea. I'll also have the nurse draw the blood tests before you leave. Please let me know if you have any questions at all. And remember, we’re here to help. We'll work together to get this under control. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You’ve been very… reassuring. I feel a little bit better now. I’ll try my best to avoid my triggers and keep the diary. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. That’s wonderful to hear! It takes courage to address these things. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you enjoy your friend’s birthday party! .
