DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather simple, really. This…place…it's exhausting. All the…young people. They don't respect the books anymore, you see? And the administration… honestly, the noise. It's simply dreadful. I've been a teacher for… a very long time, and it’s just…not what it used to be. I suppose you want me to elaborate, but truthfully, I’d rather just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling overwhelmed by changes at your workplace, and that's causing you stress. Is that correct?
PATIENT: “Overwhelmed” is… a rather pedestrian term, wouldn't you agree? It's more than that, Doctor. It’s a… decline. A cultural… erosion. But yes, it causes stress. Unnecessary stress. Honestly, all this… talking about feelings. It’s a modern affliction, if you ask me. Can we simply diagnose it and move on? I have a perfectly good book waiting for me at home.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Schlatterer. While I understand you’d like a quick resolution, it’s important to understand what is causing this stress so we can best address it. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms – headaches, difficulty sleeping, perhaps changes in appetite – along with this feeling of… erosion, as you put it?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Doctor, I am eighty-seven years old. Of course I have physical symptoms. My knees ache, my back creaks, and I require a nap in the afternoons. Is that what you’re asking? But I assure you, those are simply the hallmarks of a life well-lived, not some…emotional breakdown. The stress… it manifests as a general…discontent. And a desire to be left alone with a good volume of poetry. Is that sufficient? Really, I fail to see the connection between my aching joints and…this.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the primary concern seems to be stress related to changes at work, and you're experiencing general discontent. Aside from the aches and pains you mentioned, are you having any difficulty with sleep, changes in your eating habits, or feeling unusually tired, even for someone your age?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Sometimes I sleep. Sometimes I don't. It's hardly a novel complaint, Doctor. And eating? I eat… sufficiently. I used to have a more robust appetite, perhaps. But I attribute that to… the quality of modern cuisine. It's all processed nonsense. And feeling tired? Naturally. I've lived a long life. I suspect if you spent eighty years surrounded by…the youth, you'd be tired as well. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? Because truthfully, my time is quite valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Let's try a quick review of your medical history. I see you've been a patient here for a few years. Do you have any significant past medical problems – heart trouble, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Goodness. That was…a lifetime ago, wasn't it? I believe…Dr. Henderson, back in… oh, must have been the eighties, examined me for…high blood pressure, perhaps? Something along those lines. It was…manageable. I took a small pill, I think. And there was a… a touch of arthritis in my hands, years ago. But nothing… dramatic. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been remarkably healthy for my age. I attribute it to reading. A quiet mind, you see. Now, are we finished? I really should be going. This chair is remarkably uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, treated, and some arthritis. Any surgeries, hospitalizations, or serious illnesses that you recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… There was… a tonsillectomy, when I was quite young. And… oh, yes. A minor operation on my knee, decades ago. A meniscus tear, I believe. Routine. Nothing…significant. Hospitalizations… I spent a night in the hospital once, with a rather nasty bout of the flu, back in… the nineties, perhaps? But honestly, Doctor, I pride myself on avoiding hospitals. They’re… unsavory places. Full of germs and… unpleasant noises. Can we please move on? I’m starting to feel rather faint. And I really must get home to my books.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy, meniscus repair, and a bout of the flu. Now, let's quickly go over medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I told you, I took a small pill for my blood pressure, years ago. I no longer take it. And supplements? Good heavens, no! I have no interest in those…modern concoctions. I believe in a healthy diet – sensible portions, you understand – and a quiet mind. I occasionally take an aspirin for a headache, if absolutely necessary. But that is the extent of it. Really, I fail to see the relevance of this line of questioning. Are we simply cataloging my entire life history? Because frankly, it’s rather tedious. I have a perfectly good biography already, thank you very much. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Just one more quick thing, Mr. Schlatterer. Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history? Doctor, my family is… was… largely unremarkable. My father enjoyed a long life, though he was…a rather taciturn man. My mother suffered from…nerves, perhaps? She was a delicate woman. As for specific conditions… I honestly couldn’t say. We weren’t a family prone to discussing such unpleasant matters. It was considered… indelicate. And frankly, it’s all rather irrelevant, isn’t it? I am here because I am stressed, not because I fear inheriting some obscure familial ailment. Now, with all due respect, Doctor, I believe I’ve answered enough questions. I really must go. This… entire experience has been… draining. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing stress related to changes at your workplace. While I understand you've lived a long and healthy life, it's important to address these feelings. I'm going to recommend a brief course of cognitive behavioral therapy. It can be very helpful in managing stress and improving your overall well-being. I can provide you with a referral to a therapist specializing in geriatric concerns. Would you like that referral?
