DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I'm Dr. Trestrail. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… my strength. It’s been getting weaker, little by little. It’s hard to explain, but it feels like it’s getting harder to do things. Like walking, and holding things. It’s been going on for a while now, but it’s more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Weakness” is a broad symptom, so let’s try to narrow it down. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long you've been noticing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate? Maybe… six months, maybe a little more? It started slow, so I didn’t pay it much mind at first. Just thought I was getting old, you know? But now… it’s harder to ignore. It’s mostly in my legs, I think, but sometimes my hands feel clumsy too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six months. And you've noticed it progressively worsening. Legs mostly, but also some clumsiness in your hands. Is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. Like today, I walked in okay, but I know later on it will be harder. And sometimes in the morning I feel alright, but by the afternoon… it’s worse. It’s not always bad, but it’s almost always there, a little bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fluctuating weakness is important information. Now, are you experiencing any pain with this weakness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, Doctor. Just… tired. My legs feel heavy, and sometimes they feel… numb. Not always numb, but sometimes. It’s more like… a heaviness, and the weakness. No sharp pain or anything like that. Is that… normal? I don't know much about these things.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're telling me all of this. No pain is good, but the numbness is something we'll need to investigate. Let's move on to some other things. Have you noticed any difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Yes… a little bit. I don’t fall, but I feel… unsteady sometimes. Like I need to hold onto things. Especially when I turn my head quickly. And sometimes my steps feel… off. Not exactly clumsy, but… not smooth, you know? It’s hard to explain. My wife has noticed it too, she says I wobble a little when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady gait and some wobble, noticed by your wife as well. That's helpful. Now, have you experienced any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I wear glasses, you know, for reading. But my eyesight hasn’t gotten worse, not that I can tell. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but that’s just my old glasses, I think. I haven’t had them checked in a while. No double vision or anything like that. Just… normal old man eyes, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. No changes in vision besides the usual age-related blurriness. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you had any difficulty swallowing, speaking, or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything with my mouth and throat feels normal. I can eat and drink okay, and my voice hasn’t changed. I can talk just fine, I think! Like this! Everything feels normal there. I haven’t had any trouble with that at all.
DOCTOR: Good. No difficulty swallowing, speaking, or changes in voice. Now, let's briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but the doctor has it under control with medicine. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, I think, for an old man. Nothing major. Oh, and I was told years ago I had some arthritis, but it doesn’t bother me too much. Just a little stiffness sometimes. What about… this thing you’re asking about? Is this… something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, high blood pressure controlled with medication, and some arthritis. That's good to know. We'll get to whether this is "something bad" – we need to gather more information first. Now, what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, and anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… For my blood pressure, I take… Lisinopril, I think that’s it. Just one pill, every morning. And sometimes I take Tylenol for my arthritis, when it’s really bothering me. But not every day, just when I need it. That’s it, Doctor. Just those two. And… vitamins. A multivitamin, every day. My wife makes sure of it. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril, Tylenol as needed, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I haven’t had any trouble with medicines. I’ve taken a lot of pills in my life, and never had a problem. My wife always asks when the doctor gives me something new, but I’ve never had to tell her I was allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any neurological conditions – like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, or stroke – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mother, she had some trouble with her memory when she got older, but I don't know if it was… that Alzheimer's thing. She just forgot things, you know? And my uncle, he had a stroke, a long time ago. He couldn't walk after that. And… my sister, she has some shaking in her hands, but it's not too bad. Is that… what you're asking about? Is that a bad sign?
DOCTOR: Okay. Maternal grandmother with some memory issues, a stroke in an uncle, and hand tremors in a sister. That’s helpful information. Now, briefly, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I'm retired now, so I don't work anymore. I mostly stay home with my wife. We like to watch TV, and I like to garden a little bit when the weather is nice. I used to be very active, played a lot of football when I was young, but now I don't do much exercise. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing too much. We mostly just take it easy. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Retired, enjoys TV and gardening, limited exercise, no smoking, occasional wine. Alright, Mr. Astore, thank you for providing all of this information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. I'm going to ask you to gently squeeze my hands and resist when I push against them. And I'll be testing your balance. Let's start with your arms. Squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Good. And now, resist me as I push down. Now, let’s check your legs. Can you extend your legs straight out while I push down on them?
PATIENT: Okay… This is… a little harder. There… it feels weaker in my legs. Like I can’t push as hard as I used to. You see? It's harder than my arms.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And I’m noting 3+/5 strength bilaterally in your legs. Now, let’s check your balance. Can you stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay. This is… tricky. I feel unsteady. There… it’s harder than it used to be. I have to concentrate to keep from falling. It's not a lot, but… I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting a slightly wide-based gait and some balance instability. Based on your history and the physical exam findings, there are several possibilities we need to consider. The weakness, combined with the balance issues, could indicate a neurological problem, such as peripheral neuropathy or early signs of Parkinson’s disease. It's also important to rule out other possibilities, such as vitamin deficiencies or muscle weakness. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI? That sounds… serious. What would that show? And what about these blood tests? What are you looking for exactly? I don't want to do anything unnecessary, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong, if anything. It's just… this weakness worries me. It's getting harder to do things with my wife, and I don't want to become a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astore. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields to create detailed pictures of your brain. It helps us rule out any structural problems, like a stroke or tumor, that could be causing your symptoms. The blood tests will check for vitamin deficiencies – like B12 or D – thyroid problems, and other underlying conditions that can cause weakness and balance issues. We’re not necessarily looking for anything specific, but these tests help us to narrow down the possibilities. It's a process of elimination, to get to the root of the problem. I want to assure you we're not jumping to conclusions, but it's important to be thorough. Based on your age and symptoms, it's best to rule out any serious causes first. If the tests come back normal, we can explore other options, like physical therapy or medication to manage your symptoms. We can start with the blood tests today. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. Blood tests today. That sounds… alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it’s best, let’s do the blood tests. And… please, let me know as soon as you have the results. It’s just… the waiting is hard. I just want to know what’s happening, so I can figure out what to do. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Excellent. I will have the lab draw the blood tests now. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. As soon as I have them, I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan of action. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes or worsens. If you experience any new symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, severe headaches, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here is a lab requisition form. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For listening, and for taking the time to explain everything. I appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood tests done now, and I’ll wait for your call. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again, Doctor. I'm ready to go when you are.
