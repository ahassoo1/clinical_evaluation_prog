DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, I just want to talk about… staying safe, you know? I heard about something that can help, a pill you take before anything happens. A friend mentioned it, said it was… PrEP, I think? I want to know if it’s right for me. I’m hoping it can give me some peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Right, PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. That’s a very sensible thing to ask about, and I'm glad your friend mentioned it. It’s definitely something that can offer peace of mind for some folks. To see if it's right for you, I need to ask a few questions. It sounds like you’re thinking about HIV prevention, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Prevention. I… I don’t want to even think about getting sick, and honestly, things feel a little risky these days. I’m single, and, well, I’m not getting any younger. It's better to be careful, isn’t it? I just want to be smart about this. I guess I’m a little worried, even talking about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it is better to be careful, and you’re being very smart to explore all your options. It’s also completely normal to feel a little worried talking about this – a lot of people do. There's absolutely no shame in wanting to protect your health. Okay. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Sexual history. Right. Well… I’ve had… partners. Over the years, you know? Not a huge amount, but… enough. It's been… intermittent, let's say. I haven’t been with anyone regularly for… oh, maybe five years now. Before that, it was… different each time. I don’t always use protection, to be honest. That’s why I’m here, I think. It’s been a while since I really thought about it, and I’m starting to feel… vulnerable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Helaina. Thank you for being open with me. It's helpful to have a clearer picture. When you say "not always use protection," could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes it’s forgotten in the moment, you know? And sometimes… well, sometimes trust gets in the way. I know, I know, it’s silly. But it happened. And honestly, I’m not always the best at speaking up. I tend to… go along with things. It's a bad habit, I admit. I’m trying to be better about that, but… it’s not easy. And that’s another reason I’m here, I suppose. I want to be better, and I need some help figuring out how.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Helaina. It’s very common for people to find it difficult to have those conversations, and it takes courage to admit that. You're being very honest with me, and that’s a great first step. Just to clarify – have you ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. The last time was… oh, maybe two years ago? It was through my primary care doctor, just a routine check-up. Everything was… clear. Negative, I mean. I remember being relieved, but… things have changed since then, you know? I haven't been as careful, and honestly, I’m a little worried about what I might have picked up. That’s why I’m thinking about this PrEP thing. It would be good to know I’m protected, even if everything is okay right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It’s helpful to know you’ve been tested previously. And you’re right, PrEP could offer some good peace of mind. Now, just to get a broader picture of your health, could you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well… I have high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. Been on it for about ten years now. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, mostly just aches and pains. Nothing too serious. Oh, and I’m a bit overweight, if that matters. I try to walk when I can, but it’s not always easy with the knees. I get regular check-ups for the blood pressure, and my doctor knows about everything. I don't think anything else… Oh! I have Medicare, in case that’s important. Does that cover this PrEP thing? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure, arthritis, and being a bit overweight—I appreciate you sharing that. And yes, Medicare does generally cover PrEP, although there might be some co-pays or deductibles depending on your plan. We can definitely check the specifics before proceeding. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. But that’s it. Occasionally. Nothing regular. And a multivitamin, I guess. But that’s it. Really. No herbal supplements or anything like that. I try to keep it simple. I don't want a lot of pills, you know? That's part of why I'm hoping this PrEP thing is… straightforward.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, occasional ibuprofen, and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. It sounds like PrEP might be a good option for you, Helaina. However, before we proceed, there are a few things we need to rule out and some tests we need to do. We'll need to check your kidney function, liver function, and make sure you don’t have any other underlying conditions that would make PrEP unsafe. We also need to repeat an HIV test to confirm your status. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. I want to be sure it’s safe, you know? I wouldn't want to do something that could cause problems. Tests are fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to be careful, and I want to know I'm protected. So, yes. Let’s do the tests. How long will that take? And will it be painful? I’m not good with needles, if you must know.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Helaina. Safety is always the priority. And you’re right to ask about the tests—it’s good to be informed. The tests involve a blood draw, and it will be a small amount of blood taken from your arm. As for being painful… most people don’t find it very painful at all. It’s a quick pinch, and it’s over very quickly. We have experienced phlebotomists here who are very good at making it as comfortable as possible. We can also use numbing cream if you'd like. It will take a few minutes to draw the blood, and then we’ll send it to the lab. The results usually take about a week to come back. While we're waiting for the results, we can also discuss the potential side effects of PrEP and how to take it correctly. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a week. That feels like a long time, but I suppose it’s necessary. And a quick pinch… I can handle a quick pinch. No numbing cream, I think. Just… do it quickly. And yes, please explain everything about the side effects. I want to know what I’m getting into. I don’t want any surprises. And… what if the tests aren’t good? What if something is wrong? I don't want to think about it, but… I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A week does feel like a long time, but it’s important to have accurate results. And you’re very wise to want to be fully informed. We will, of course, explain everything in detail – the potential side effects, how to take PrEP correctly, and what to do if you experience any problems. The most common side effects are mild – nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue – but they usually go away on their own. As for what if the tests aren’t good… if something is wrong, we will discuss the results with you in detail and develop a plan to address it. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, and it’s always better to know what’s going on so we can provide the best possible care. We have specialists we can refer you to if needed. Okay. Let’s get started with the blood draw. Please have a seat on the examination table, and I’ll call the phlebotomist. We’ll get everything done quickly and efficiently. And remember, please don’t hesitate to ask any questions at any time.
PATIENT: Okay. Let’s get it over with. The sooner I know, the better. I’m… a little nervous, if you don't mind me saying. I haven't had a blood test in ages. Just… do it quickly, please.
DOCTOR: “Phlebotomy to room two, please. We have a patient ready for bloodwork.” Okay, Helaina. The phlebotomist should be right with us. While we wait, just try to relax. Deep breaths can help. And don’t worry, they are very skilled and gentle. They'll explain everything as they go. Do you have a preferred arm they should use?
PATIENT: Um… I think… my left arm is better. It’s… stronger, I suppose. I used to get injections in that arm when I was younger, and it didn't bother me as much. But… please tell them to be gentle. I really don’t like needles. This is… silly, I know. But it’s just a phobia, I guess. And… could you stay with me? Just while they do it? It would… help. I feel a little foolish asking, but… I’d appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Helaina. Phobias are very common, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about needles. And absolutely, I’ll stay with you the entire time. I wouldn’t leave you. “Good morning! Dr. Auelua, nice to see you. And good morning to you, ma’am. Dr. Auelua mentioned you’d prefer your left arm, and that you might be a little nervous. We’ll take extra care to make this as comfortable as possible.” “Thank you, Sarah. Let’s just make sure she's comfortable and explain everything as you go.” “Just breathe deeply, Helaina. You’re doing great. Sarah will guide you through everything.”
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Just… hurry. I hate this. Just… tell me when it’s over. Please.
DOCTOR: “You’re doing wonderfully, Helaina. Just relax your arm as much as possible. Sarah is very skilled, and it will be over very quickly.” “Just a little pinch now… and then it’s almost done.” “All done! Just a little pressure for a moment to stop the bleeding.” “See?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, it’s over. Thank goodness. That wasn’t… as bad as I thought, but I still don’t like it. Thank you… thank you both. Will it… bruise? I hate bruises. And will it hurt later? I always get a sore arm after injections.
DOCTOR: “You did great, Helaina. Really. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little shaken up afterwards. And you’re very welcome.” “There’s a little redness, which is normal, but it doesn’t look like it will bruise badly. A small bruise is possible, but it should fade quickly. As for soreness, some people do experience a little discomfort afterwards, but it usually resolves within a day or two. You can apply a cold compress if it’s bothering you, and over-the-counter pain relievers can help if needed.” “Let’s just sit here for a few moments to make sure you’re feeling okay, and then we can go over the next steps. We’ll send the blood sample to the lab, and the results should be back in about a week. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available.” “Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m okay. Just… a little tired. And maybe a little shaky. A glass of water would be nice, if you have one. And… thank you again. For being so patient. And for staying with me. I just… I really hate needles. But I did it. I actually did it. That’s… something, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “You absolutely did it, Helaina. That is something. And you were very brave. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little tired and shaky afterwards. It takes courage to face your fears.” “Here you go. Take your time, and sip it slowly.” “Now, while you’re finishing your water, let me just quickly recap the next steps. We’ve sent the blood sample to the lab for testing. They'll be looking for HIV, as well as checking your kidney and liver function to make sure you're a good candidate for PrEP. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back, which should be in about a week. If everything looks good, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss starting PrEP and answer any further questions you might have.” “Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m okay for now. Just… waiting. That’s the hard part, isn’t it? Waiting to know. And… what if it is bad? What if something is wrong? I don’t even know what I’d do. I don’t want to think about it, but… it’s in the back of my mind. I’m just… scared. It’s silly, I know. I should be strong. But I’m not. Not today.
DOCTOR: “It’s not silly at all, Helaina. It’s perfectly natural to feel scared, and it’s okay to not be strong all the time. Waiting is the hardest part, and it’s understandable that you’re anxious. And you're right to think about all possibilities, but try not to get too caught up in worst-case scenarios. We'll deal with whatever comes, together." “If the tests do come back positive, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. There are many effective treatments available for HIV, and people with HIV can live long, healthy lives. We would discuss the results with you in detail, and connect you with specialists who can provide the best possible care and support. We would also discuss your options for treatment, and help you make an informed decision about what's right for you." “But let's not jump to conclusions. Right now, let’s just focus on getting through the next few days. Try to take care of yourself, and do things that make you feel good. And remember, I’m here for you, no matter what. If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to call the clinic. We can provide support and resources to help you cope with any anxiety you're feeling." “Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve been… very kind. Thank you. I just… need to go home and… think. And maybe watch some mindless television. Distract myself. I’m sure that’s what I need. Thank you again. For everything. I’ll… wait for the call.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Helaina. Anytime. And that sounds like a perfect plan – home, rest, and some mindless television. Distraction is a very good coping mechanism." “Remember, if you’re feeling overwhelmed at any point, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here for you, and we can provide support and resources to help you cope with any anxiety you’re feeling.” “Take care of yourself, Helaina. And I’ll see you when the results are back.” “Have a good day.”
