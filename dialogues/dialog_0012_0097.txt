DOCTOR: Hi Marija, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about making arrangements. Important arrangements, for the future. My husband suggested I come speak with you about… what do you call them? Those forms people fill out when they can’t make decisions for themselves anymore. He said you could provide them. It’s all rather… unsettling, frankly. But he insists.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're talking about advance care planning documents – things like a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. It's actually very thoughtful of both of you to be thinking about this now. It can be unsettling, but it’s a really important step in making sure your wishes are respected if you ever become unable to speak for yourself. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what prompted this conversation with your husband?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? He watches too many dramas on television. All these… tragic illnesses and complicated family situations. He’s convinced something dreadful is just around the corner. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I've always been quite… robust. But he worries. He says if anything happens, he wants to be prepared. It’s… excessive, really. But I suppose it’s better to indulge him than to listen to endless lectures about responsibility. He’s a good man, just… prone to anxiety. Do these forms require a great deal of… detail? I haven’t much patience for bureaucracy.
DOCTOR: It sounds like he’s coming from a good place, even if it's a bit overzealous. It’s very common for people to want to feel prepared, especially when they see difficult situations unfolding around them. And no, the forms don’t necessarily require a great deal of detail, but the more clearly we can outline your wishes, the better. We’ll go through them step-by-step, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It’s mostly about identifying what kind of medical care you would want – or not want – in different scenarios. Before we dive into the forms themselves, I'd like to get a little bit of your medical history, just to have a complete picture. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses? No, not really. A few bouts of the flu, naturally. And I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been very careful with my health. Proper diet, plenty of rest, and avoiding… questionable establishments. My husband, on the other hand… he’s always been a bit reckless. He insists on skiing, even after he broke his leg last winter. Honestly, the man has no sense. As for surgeries, just the tonsils. Nothing else. I don’t believe in unnecessary interventions. Are we getting anywhere with these forms, or are we simply discussing my husband’s poor life choices?
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Marija. Knowing your history – or lack thereof, in this case – is helpful. And it's good to hear you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. It sounds like you have a clear idea of what you want and don’t want when it comes to your health, which is excellent. Okay, so no significant illnesses, tonsillectomy as a child, and you generally feel very healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. My husband, again, is rather sensitive. He breaks out in hives from… well, from everything, it seems. Pollen, dust, certain fabrics, cats… it’s a wonder he survives. But me? No allergies. I'm remarkably resilient. Though I do find certain perfumes… overpowering. But that’s a matter of preference, not an allergy. Are we discussing my husband's frail constitution again, or can we finally get to these forms? I have a luncheon appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: No, we’re definitely getting to the forms, Marija. I promise! It sounds like you truly are remarkably resilient. Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. And you mentioned a luncheon appointment. That's good to keep in mind. Before we dive into the specifics of the advance care planning documents, let's just quickly touch on your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Regular medications? No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in relying on pharmaceuticals. A good night's sleep and a healthy diet are far more effective, in my experience. Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea if I'm feeling particularly stressed, but that's hardly a medication. My husband, on the other hand… he’s always popping pills. For his nerves, for his allergies, for his… everything. It’s a constant stream of prescriptions. But me? Nothing. Just a healthy lifestyle and a firm belief in natural remedies. Honestly, Doctor, are you quite sure we need to discuss my husband’s medical habits? This is about my arrangements, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. This is about your arrangements. I apologize if my questions seemed to be focused on your husband. I was simply trying to get a complete picture of your overall health, and sometimes people mention family history when talking about their own well-being. So, to confirm: you are not currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, let’s finally get to those forms. We’ll start with the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. This document allows you to name someone – a trusted family member or friend – to make medical decisions for you if you become unable to do so yourself. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose. I had assumed that was the purpose of these forms. My husband has already selected himself, naturally. He insists he is the only one capable of making such important decisions. Frankly, I find it rather presumptuous, but arguing with him is… exhausting. So, if he is allowed to name himself, then proceed. He’s quite insistent on being in control of everything, you see. Is there a great deal of paperwork involved? I do dislike bureaucracy immensely. And is there a witness required? Because I doubt our neighbor will be available. She’s gone on holiday to… well, somewhere unpleasant, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Marija. It's very common for people to name a spouse as their healthcare proxy. And yes, a witness is required. It needs to be someone who is not your husband, and who is not named in your will. A neighbor would be fine, as long as they’re not a beneficiary. There is some paperwork, but I’ll walk you through it step-by-step. It’s mostly about clearly stating your wishes and identifying your healthcare proxy. I have the forms here, and I’ll explain each section as we go. We’ll also need to discuss what kind of medical care you would want in different scenarios - things like life support, resuscitation, and pain management. Before we start, though, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health status?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’ve already told you. I’m perfectly healthy. Robust, even. I exercise regularly – brisk walks, mostly. I eat a balanced diet. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, perhaps. I’ve never had any serious illnesses or surgeries – aside from the tonsils, of course. I sleep well. I manage my stress effectively. I’m… meticulous about my health. Frankly, Doctor, I’m surprised you need all these forms. It seems rather… unnecessary, given my excellent condition. But if it will appease my husband, then I suppose we can proceed. Just please, try to be brief. I have a luncheon appointment, you know. And I do dislike bureaucracy immensely.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Marija. It does seem unnecessary when you’re in excellent health. However, these forms are about preparing for any eventuality, however unlikely. It's about ensuring your wishes are respected, even if you're unable to communicate them yourself. And I will absolutely be as brief as possible. We’ll focus on the essential information, and I’ll explain everything clearly and concisely. Since you’re in such good health, we can keep this relatively straightforward. Let’s start with the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare. This document allows you to name someone – in this case, your husband – to make medical decisions for you if you’re unable to do so yourself. Do you have any specific concerns or wishes regarding the kinds of decisions he would be making?
PATIENT: Well... he can be rather… impulsive. And overly dramatic. He tends to overreact to everything. So, I suppose I would want to be clear that I do not want any heroic measures taken if there's… no hope. No prolonging the inevitable. I’ve seen enough hospital dramas to know what that entails. And I certainly don’t want him spending a fortune on unnecessary treatments. He has a tendency to be extravagant, you see. A simple, dignified exit is all I ask for. No elaborate interventions. And absolutely no experimental procedures. He’s always been fascinated by the latest medical technology, but I find it… unsettling. Is that clear enough? I don't want him making a spectacle of it, you understand. And I certainly don't want him bankrupting the family.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very clear, Marija. You want to avoid heroic measures, unnecessary treatments, and experimental procedures. You prefer a simple, dignified exit, and you want to ensure it doesn’t become a financial burden. We’ll definitely document all of that in the Durable Power of Attorney form. It’s good that you’re thinking about these things now. This will give your husband clear guidance if he ever has to make those difficult decisions. Now, the next document we’ll discuss is the Living Will. This allows you to specify your wishes regarding specific medical treatments, such as life support, resuscitation, and pain management. We can outline what types of treatments you would want, and what types you would want to avoid. Would you like to start with life support?
PATIENT: Life support… honestly, the very thought is dreadful. I’ve seen enough science fiction films to know what that entails. Machines beeping, tubes everywhere… it’s not a dignified way to go. No, I absolutely do not want to be kept alive artificially if there’s no hope of recovery. I want to be allowed to… pass peacefully. A simple, quiet exit, as I said before. No prolonged suffering. And certainly no being kept alive just because the machines are still functioning. It’s… barbaric, frankly. Is it possible to simply state “no life support under any circumstances”? That would be ideal. I don’t want my husband having to make that decision. It’s too much for him. He's… emotional. And he might be persuaded by some… overzealous doctor. I want it clearly stated. No life support. Under any circumstances. Can we do that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we absolutely can do that. We will document very clearly in your Living Will that you do not want life support under any circumstances. We will also include a statement about your desire for a peaceful, dignified exit. This will provide clear guidance to your husband and to any medical professionals involved in your care. It's important to be very specific, and we are doing that. Now, let's talk about resuscitation. This refers to attempts to revive you if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. Do you have any wishes regarding CPR or other resuscitation efforts?
PATIENT: Resuscitation… honestly, it sounds rather… traumatic. All that chest compression and… electric shocks. No, I absolutely do not want to be resuscitated if my heart stops beating. It’s not a dignified way to go. I've lived a full life, and I want to go peacefully, without all that… commotion. I don’t want my husband having to witness that. He’s… sensitive. And I certainly don’t want some young doctor breaking my ribs trying to bring me back to life. It’s… undignified. Is it possible to simply state “no resuscitation under any circumstances”? That would be ideal. I want it clearly stated. No resuscitation. Under any circumstances. Can we do that? And please, try to be quick. My luncheon appointment is fast approaching.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija. We will document very clearly in your Living Will that you do not want resuscitation under any circumstances. We will include a statement reflecting your desire for a peaceful passing and avoiding any traumatic interventions. It sounds like you have given a lot of thought to this, and I want to assure you that we are capturing your wishes accurately. Now, the final aspect we should discuss is pain management. Would you like to state your wishes regarding pain relief?
PATIENT: Pain relief… well, that’s rather different, isn’t it? I don’t want to suffer needlessly, of course. But I also don’t want to be… completely sedated. I want to be aware of my surroundings, even if I’m not feeling well. So, I want to be given enough pain relief to be comfortable, but not so much that I’m… out of it. I want to be able to say goodbye to my loved ones, if possible. And I want to be able to… appreciate my final moments. So, yes, I want pain relief, but a moderate amount. Enough to be comfortable, but not enough to… lose consciousness. Is that clear enough? I don't want to be a vegetable, you understand. And I certainly don't want to be… out of it when my family is saying goodbye. It's… important. Can we write that down? Moderate pain relief. Enough to be comfortable, but not enough to lose consciousness. And please, try to be quick. My luncheon appointment is fast approaching. I do believe that’s everything, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very clear, Marija. We will document that you desire moderate pain relief to ensure your comfort, but that you do not want to be sedated to the point of losing consciousness. We'll include a statement that you wish to remain aware of your surroundings and able to say goodbye to loved ones. And yes, I believe that covers everything. We've documented your wishes regarding life support, resuscitation, and pain management. I have here the Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare and the Living Will. Please review them carefully, and if you are satisfied with the content, you can sign them. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And you’ve captured my wishes accurately. It’s all rather… unsettling, to be honest, but I suppose it’s better to be prepared. There. That should be sufficient. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. My luncheon appointment awaits. And I do believe my husband will be… displeased if I’m late. Thank you for your assistance, Doctor. You’ve been… surprisingly efficient. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. I'm glad I could help. I will make copies of these documents for your records and your husband’s. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a lovely luncheon. .
