DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. It's my nails, see? They...they just look funny. Not like they used to. I don't even know what to call it. They're just…off. You see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. They do appear… unusual. Could you describe what's changed about them?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, they're kinda…thick, I think. And the color…it's not…bright. Like, not a nice pink. More…yellowish? And they don't grow like they used to, not at all. I used to get 'em done, fancy-like, but I haven't in ages. Honestly, I don’t even remember when I stopped. Everything's a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Thickening and discoloration, and slower growth… right. And how long have you noticed these changes, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. A long while. I dunno…months, maybe? It’s hard to say. Time just…goes. I think it started after I, uh…well, after things got…complicated. Doesn’t matter. It’s just my nails. They look awful, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don't hurt hurt. Maybe a little…sensitive sometimes when I’m, you know, doing stuff. Like, washing dishes or something. But not a big deal. Just ugly. And kinda embarrassing, if you wanna know the truth.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm…let me see. I guess it’s kinda…dry. Flaky, maybe? I put lotion on, but it doesn’t seem to help much. My hands are just…old, I guess. Everything's falling apart.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of fungal infections – athlete’s foot, ringworm, anything like that?
PATIENT: Fungal? Oh, goodness, no. I don't think so. I mean, I’ve had…things. But not…fungus. I don't even know what that looks like! I’m just an old lady with bad nails, Doc. Is that all it is?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Ms. Thut. Fungal infections are common, but there are other possibilities. Given the thickening, discoloration, and slow growth, I’d like to rule out a fungal infection, and potentially other conditions. I’m going to take a small sample from under your nail for testing. It’s a quick procedure, shouldn’t be any discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Testing? Oh. You gotta…scrape my nails? I don’t like that. Is it gonna hurt? And what if it's something…bad? Honestly, I'm not good with doctors and all this poking and prodding. It's just my nails, right? Can't you just give me some cream or something?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, it’s a very minor procedure. A small scraping, nothing more. It’s the only way to determine what's causing the changes to your nails. It could be a simple fungal infection, easily treated with topical medication. However, it's important to rule out other, less common possibilities. I assure you, I'm a professional, and I’ll make it as comfortable as possible. Delaying diagnosis could potentially worsen the condition, if it is something more serious. Now, are you willing to allow me to take a sample for testing?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But be gentle, okay? And quick! I don't want a fuss. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. But promise me, if it’s nothing, you won’t just keep poking and prodding. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll need to clean the area first. It may feel slightly cool. Then, I'll use a small instrument to gently scrape a bit of nail debris. It shouldn’t be painful, but you might feel some pressure. After that, I’ll apply a small bandage. The sample will be sent to the lab, and we should have results in about a week. Please try to relax, Ms. Thut. This won’t take long.
PATIENT: .
