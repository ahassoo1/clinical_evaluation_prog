DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Doctor Giganti? I am Lindra. My husband, he find this place… for me. He want me to live in… a nice place for old people. He say I need paper from you, yes? To say I am okay to go.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, you can absolutely call me Doctor Giganti. And yes, it sounds like your husband is seeking a medical evaluation to help determine if assisted living is a suitable option for you. That’s perfectly alright. To start, could you tell me a little more about why your husband thinks assisted living might be a good fit right now?
PATIENT: He say… I forget things. Sometimes. Not all the time. Like… where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for breakfast. Small things. He worry. He want me safe. I feel okay, mostly. But he… he get scared when I not remember. He say it is better if people help me. I think so too, maybe. It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband is very caring and wants to ensure your well-being, and that he’s noticed some changes in your memory. It’s good that you’re both thinking proactively about this. Could you tell me a bit more about these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… It is not… every day. Maybe two, three times a week? I look for something… like my keys… and I not remember where I put them. Then… sometimes I go to make tea, and I forget what I am doing. Just for a minute. Then I remember. I still cook, still clean. I still talk to my friends. Not so much now, with… everything. But I am not… lost. I know who I am, and I know my family. Just… small things. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. It sounds like these are relatively recent concerns, and that they’re not impacting your ability to do everything you normally do. To get a better understanding of things, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Ask me anything. I try to remember.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Let’s start with your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… doctor… I see a doctor for my blood. He say it is a little high. I take a pill. Every morning. And… oh! My knees. They hurt sometimes. The doctor give me something for that too. But mostly, I am okay. I eat good food, I try to walk… sometimes. Not so much now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re being treated for high blood pressure and manage some knee pain. Do you know the names of the medications you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… the names… no. I give the little paper to the pharmacy. They give me the pills. My daughter, she help me with that now. She know the names, I think. I not good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lindra. Many people find it easier to let others manage their medications. We can certainly get that information from the pharmacy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. A long time ago… when I was young, I have my tonsils out. And… oh! When I have the baby, I stay in the hospital. That is… many years ago. No other surgeries, I think. No, not that I remember. I never been sick… serious sick. Just… colds sometimes. Like everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and hospitalization for childbirth. No other surgeries or serious illnesses. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Yes. My husband, he is… old now. We have three children. Two boys, one girl. They all have families. Many grandchildren! They visit sometimes. They are busy, you know? But they are good children. My mother… she pass away many years ago. My father… he pass away even longer ago. I have one sister, she live in… another city. We talk on the phone.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a lovely family. Has anyone in your family experienced memory problems or conditions like Alzheimer's disease or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. My grandmother… she forget things when she get very old. But I not know if it was… that disease you say. She just… old. My aunt, she have trouble remembering names too. But maybe it is just… getting old. No one… no one have the… special disease. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your daily habits. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, doctor. No. I never drink much. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. But not every day. And no, I never smoke. And no… no special things. I am a good girl.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Sometimes I sneeze when the flowers bloom, but that is just… the flowers. No special allergies. I can eat anything. I like to cook, you know? I try many things.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Alright, Lindra, we’ve covered a lot of ground. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That is okay. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not surprising given what you've told me about your medication. Now, I'm going to check your pulse. Pulse is 72 and regular. Let's take a look at your ears, eyes, nose, and throat. Everything looks normal here. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’d like to do a very simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to remember them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Three words? Okay. Tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Now, we'll move on to a few other questions. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about your orientation – things like the date, where we are, and the current year. It's just to get a baseline. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Hmm… Today is… August? Is it the 2nd? Yes, I think so. August 2nd.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right! August 2nd. Good. Now, do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is hard. Is it… 2025? Yes, I think so. 2025.
DOCTOR: Yes, 2025. Very good. And finally, do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… this is… a doctor’s office? Yes. Doctor Giganti’s office. Is… suburban? My husband say it is suburban.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. You’re doing very well. Alright, Lindra, that’s all for the brief exam. Thank you for your patience. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems you're experiencing some mild memory issues. The good news is, it doesn't appear to be anything severe at this point. However, it is important to investigate further to determine the cause and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend a brain imaging scan, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? And… a scan? Hmm. That sounds… scary. But if you think it is important, yes. Okay. If it will help me… and my husband… yes. But… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lindra. The blood work is a simple procedure – just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. There might be a slight pinch, but it’s very quick. The MRI scan is non-invasive – you’ll lie on a table, and a machine will use magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. It's a bit noisy, but it doesn't involve any radiation or discomfort. You will be able to communicate with the technician at all times. We'll get the results back within a week or so, and then we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active and engaged, both mentally and physically. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Blood work, and the scan. Okay. My daughter, she can take me, yes? She is good with this… with doctors. And… will the scan tell me if I need… the special place? For old people?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, your daughter can accompany you – that’s a great idea. And yes, the scan can help us determine if assisted living is the right option for you. It will give us a clearer picture of your brain health and help us understand the cause of your memory issues. It's important to remember that the scan is just one piece of the puzzle. We’ll also consider your overall health, your daily functioning, and your personal preferences before making any decisions. We’ll have a thorough discussion about all the options. Now, while we wait for the results, I would like to refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… a neurologist? Is that another doctor? More tests? I… I don’t know. I am getting tired of tests. But if you think it is important… and will help me… okay. But please… no more big machines. And please… talk to my daughter. She can ask the questions.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your fatigue, and I apologize for the number of tests. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. They can provide a more in-depth assessment of your memory issues and help us determine the best course of action. And absolutely, I will be happy to discuss everything with your daughter. I will make sure she is involved in the process and that all your questions are answered. For now, let’s schedule the blood work and MRI. We can set up the appointment with the neurologist after we get the results back. Are you able to schedule those appointments today?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. My daughter, she can help. She is good with the phone. Can she call later? To make the appointments? And… can you give me a paper… with the names of the tests? So I can show her?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfect. Your daughter can call later to schedule the appointments. And yes, I will print out a list of the tests for you to show her. Here you are. It lists the tests we discussed, and I’ve included a brief description of each one. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And… thank you for talking to my daughter. She will worry less if she knows what is happening. I hope… I hope everything will be okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right, keeping your daughter informed is a great idea. We'll take things one step at a time, and we’ll work together to figure out what’s best for you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to discussing the results with you and your daughter soon. Have a good day.
