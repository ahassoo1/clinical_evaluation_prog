DOCTOR: Right. Kiante Sayar, 33 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… a bit of a strange one, actually. I need a letter confirming I'm able to fly. My insurance, Medicare, is asking for it before they’ll cover a trip to visit family. It's just...a formality, I hope.
DOCTOR: A letter for fitness to fly… right. Medicare’s being… thorough. And you’re certain it’s simply a formality?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what I understood. My sister helped me with the paperwork, and she said it’s standard now for long flights, just to be safe. I’ve been perfectly healthy, no problems at all, but they want the doctor’s say-so. Honestly, it’s a bit stressful because I’m trying to book the tickets before the prices go up.
DOCTOR: Well, “perfectly healthy” is… subjective. To be perfectly clear, are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Truly. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, no chest pain… nothing. I walk every day, I eat well, I sleep fine. It’s just… paperwork. I’m really sorry to bother you with this, Doctor, but the deadline is looming. Is there a quick form I can fill out, or do you need to do a full checkup? I'm happy either way, but time is a bit tight.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I suppose a complete checkup for a simple flight clearance is… excessive. However, I do need something to base this letter on. Let's do a basic review then. Have you had any recent hospitalizations or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Nothing at all in the last… well, ever, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but everything was fine after that. My husband… he passed away a few years ago, and even that didn't require hospitalization at the very end, thankfully. It was peaceful. I apologize, that’s a bit morbid. Just trying to be thorough. Are we talking blood pressure, pulse, something like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. Blood pressure, pulse, and a quick listen to your lungs. And please, try to stick to the medical history. We can discuss… other matters later, if necessary. Roll up your sleeve, please. And while I'm doing this, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. Sorry, I get carried away sometimes. No medications at all, Doctor. Not even over-the-counter things regularly. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Honestly, I try to stay as healthy as possible. This trip is really important; it’s the first time I’ve seen my nieces and nephews since… well, a long time. And my sister is worried about me travelling alone, so I want to be able to tell her I've had a doctor's check-up.
DOCTOR: 128 over 76. Not bad. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Bilaterally. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies at all. Food, medications, anything. I’ve always been very lucky that way. My husband… he had hay fever, but I never even got a sniffle. I really appreciate you doing this so quickly, Doctor. I know you're busy. Is this enough for the letter? I’m happy to answer any other questions, of course. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, no current medications, normal vital signs, clear lungs. And you’ve had no recent hospitalizations or surgeries. Frankly, it sounds straightforward. I'll draft a brief letter stating you are cleared for air travel, based on this examination. It will be a general statement, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. General is perfectly fine. I don't need anything detailed, just confirmation that I've been seen and deemed fit to fly. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve really saved me a lot of stress. I can pick it up from the reception desk, correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, reception will have it. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if Medicare requires further documentation, although I doubt they will. And… try to enjoy your trip. Next.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and help. You have a good day. .
