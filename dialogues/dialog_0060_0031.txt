DOCTOR: Right. Well, Nixon, hello. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s my left leg. It’s gotten… quite big, you see. And I know I have a bit of a funny heartbeat sometimes, the one the other doctor told me about. It’s… atrial fibrillation, I think she said? It just feels… off, and now my leg is swollen.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, right. And this leg swelling… how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started maybe three days ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a little puffiness, really. But it’s gotten worse each day. I noticed it properly yesterday morning. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. It feels heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it just the left leg?
PATIENT: Yes, just the left one. The right one is perfectly fine, thank you. No swelling there at all. I’ve been trying to keep it elevated, as I read online is a good idea, but it doesn’t seem to be helping much. Is that… correct? Should I be doing something else?
DOCTOR: Online, hmm?
PATIENT: Well, my friend Agnes told me to look things up. She said it's better than just waiting, but I don’t really know much about… legs, or hearts, to be honest. I just know it feels different than usual, and I thought it best to come and see a proper doctor about it. I wouldn’t want it to get any worse, would I?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Dr. Agnes is well-meaning, I'm sure. But it’s always best to get a professional opinion. Now, let's have a look at this leg. Could you come over here and sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I hope it isn't too much trouble. It feels a bit silly, to be honest, but I want to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Just lie down, please. And try to relax. I'm going to palpate your leg, check for any tenderness, and measure the circumference. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Very well. I’ll try my best to relax, Doctor. It’s just… I don’t like being touched, if you don’t mind. Not that you’re doing anything wrong, of course! It’s just… a bit much.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is a medical examination. I need to touch you to assess the problem. Just try to be still. Okay. Calf circumference is… 42 centimeters. Thigh is 60. Now, let's compare that to the right leg… Right calf is 38 centimeters. Thigh is 56 centimeters. There's a definite difference. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, that is a difference. I hadn’t really thought about numbers, just that it felt bigger. And pain… hmm. Not exactly pain, Doctor. More like a dull ache, if I move it a certain way. Mostly around the back of my knee. It’s not constant, though. Just when I… bend it too much, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt to just… be there. Is that making sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Dull ache with movement… Right. Any redness or warmth to the touch?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t think so. It feels… normal, temperature-wise. No redness either. It just looks… bigger, that’s all. And feels a bit heavy, as I said. It’s not hot or anything. I’ve been worried about a blood clot, if you don't mind me saying. Agnes read something about those online too.
DOCTOR: Agnes, again. Look, I understand you're concerned, but relying on internet searches is rarely helpful, and often causes unnecessary anxiety. Now, I need to listen to your heart. It's important to assess the atrial fibrillation. Please lie back flat and stay still.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. I apologize for mentioning Agnes so much. She just… worries a lot, and she wants to help. I’ll try to remember to just listen to you from now on. Please do listen to my heart. I do feel a bit strange sometimes.
DOCTOR: Irregular rhythm, as expected. Rate is… around 90. Now, take a deep breath for me. And another. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to check your reflexes and sensation in your leg. This is just to rule out any nerve involvement. It won’t hurt, but it might feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll try my best. I don't like surprises, if you don't mind. Just tell me what you're doing before you do it, alright? I do get a bit… flustered easily. Especially with things I don’t expect.
DOCTOR: Right. I’m going to gently tap on your knee and ankle. It’s called checking your reflexes. Just relax your leg. And now the ankle. Okay. And now I'm going to lightly touch your leg with this… Tell me when you feel that.
PATIENT: Oh! That was a bit sudden! But… alright. I felt that. And… yes, I feel that now. That tickles. It’s… strange. A bit unpleasant, if I'm honest. Are you sure everything is alright? I don’t usually like being poked and prodded, even by doctors. It makes me a bit anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Now, I'm going to need to ask you a few more questions. Have you had any recent injuries to your leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No injuries at all. I haven’t fallen or bumped it, or anything like that. I’ve been… mostly just sitting, to be honest. I’m a computer science teacher, so I spend a lot of time at my desk. Perhaps that’s it? Is it possible to swell your leg just from sitting too long? I do try to get up and move around, but it’s not always easy. It’s a very demanding job, you see.
DOCTOR: And what about shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Hmm. Not… exactly. I do get a bit… puffed, if I walk up the stairs. But that’s just because I’m not very fit, I think. I don’t exercise much, as I said. It’s not a proper shortness of breath, like… struggling for air. Just a bit tired after a bit of exertion. Would that count? I do feel a bit lightheaded sometimes, too, but that’s just… my blood pressure, I believe. The doctor told me it fluctuates.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, it’s likely this is a combination of things. The atrial fibrillation can contribute to swelling in your legs. Prolonged sitting certainly doesn’t help. And we need to rule out a couple of possibilities. I’m going to order a D-dimer test to rule out a blood clot, just to be safe. And I want you to get an ECG done to monitor your heart rhythm. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… D-dimer test? And an ECG? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Is it something serious? And what will they do? I don’t like needles, Doctor. Not at all. And I get very anxious in hospitals. Is there any way to avoid it? Is it absolutely necessary? I just… I don’t cope well with medical things.
DOCTOR: Look, a D-dimer is a simple blood test. It helps rule out a blood clot. The ECG is a painless test where they put stickers on your chest to monitor your heart rhythm. It’s standard procedure with atrial fibrillation. It’s necessary to rule out serious problems. I understand you’re anxious, but we need to be thorough. I can prescribe a mild sedative to help you relax during the tests, if that would help. But avoiding tests entirely isn't an option. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: A sedative… that might help, yes. Anything to calm my nerves. And allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’m allergic to dust, a little bit, but that’s hardly a medical allergy, is it? Just a bit of sneezing. And… I used to have a reaction to shellfish, when I was a child, but I haven’t eaten shellfish in years. So, probably not. Just the dust, really. But that’s not important, is it? Is the ECG done at this clinic? And how long will it take? I have a class to teach this afternoon, you see. I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, then. The ECG can be done here at the clinic. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. I’ll write you a referral slip. As for the D-dimer, we’ll send you to the lab down the hall. That will also be fairly quick. I’ll also prescribe you a mild diuretic to help reduce the swelling. And I strongly advise you to increase your activity level. Walk for at least 30 minutes a day. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A diuretic? Another pill… Oh dear. And walk for 30 minutes… that does sound exhausting. Is it safe to take all these pills together? And what if the tests show something… serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t do well in hospitals, you see. I get very anxious. And… what exactly is a D-dimer, if you don’t mind me asking? Perhaps if I understood what they're looking for, it wouldn’t be so frightening. I just… I’m a bit overwhelmed, you see. There’s so much information.
DOCTOR: Right. A D-dimer is a blood test that looks for a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. It doesn’t diagnose a blood clot, it just indicates if further investigation is needed. The diuretic will help your body get rid of excess fluid, which will reduce the swelling in your leg. It's a low dose and generally well-tolerated. As for the hospital… let’s not discuss that until we have the results of the tests. If something serious is found, we’ll discuss the best course of action. I understand your anxiety, and we'll try to manage it as best as we can. I can write you a prescription for a stronger sedative if needed. Do you have any other questions before I finish up?
PATIENT: A stronger sedative… perhaps that would be best. Yes, please. And… will the diuretic make me need to… go to the bathroom a lot? I have a rather long walk to the staff room, you see, and… well, it’s not very convenient. And… is there anything I should avoid eating while taking these pills? Or drinking? I don’t want to make things worse. I just… I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. And all these pills and tests… it’s all a bit much. Thank you for being patient with me, Doctor. I do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Yes, the diuretic may increase your urination. Try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can worsen the effect. And avoid salty foods. As for your anxiety, if you're truly struggling, I can refer you to a therapist. Here are the prescriptions and the referral for the ECG. The lab is down the hall, and the front desk can give you directions. I'll call you with the results of the D-dimer test in a couple of days. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time, and for being so patient with me. And thank you for the sedative prescription. I do appreciate it. I'll try to… not worry too much. And I’ll try to walk for 30 minutes, and avoid salty foods. And caffeine. And alcohol. It’s just… a lot to remember. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Right. Goodbye.
