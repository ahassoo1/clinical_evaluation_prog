DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. It’s a bit… difficult to explain, but I just feel very low. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I'd like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: "Very low," you say. Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It hasn’t been a consistent thing, you understand. More… comes and goes. But I’d say, truly feeling this way… maybe three months now? It’s been worse lately, though. Especially the last month. It’s… tiring, frankly.
DOCTOR: Three months, worsening over the last month. And when you say “feeling low”, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes, alright. It’s not… sadness, not exactly. It’s more like… a heaviness. A lack of… enjoyment. Things I used to find pleasure in, I just… don’t. And I find myself very easily irritated. Small things bother me terribly, you see. And… I sleep a lot. More than I should, I think. It's difficult to get going in the mornings.
DOCTOR: A heaviness, loss of enjoyment, irritability, and increased sleep… Right. And are you experiencing any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's a good question. My appetite... it comes and goes, really. Some days I can eat a little, other days I have no interest at all. I've lost a bit of weight, I suspect, though I haven't been weighing myself regularly. Not my priority, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any difficulty with concentration, or perhaps feeling restless, even when you are tired?
PATIENT: Concentration… yes, that's a problem. I find it very hard to focus on anything for long. My mind wanders. And restless… not exactly. Not like I’m pacing, but… uneasy. A sort of… inner fidgeting, perhaps? It’s difficult to explain properly. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Right. Have you experienced any significant life changes or stressors recently?
PATIENT: Significant changes… well, my divorce was finalised last year. It was… amicable, but still. It’s been difficult adjusting, I suppose. And my son lives quite far away now, in America. I don’t see him as often as I’d like. Beyond that… not really. Just… life, you see. Getting older.
DOCTOR: Divorce finalised last year, son living abroad… Alright. And do you have any family history of depression or other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My sister, Beatrice… she struggled with anxiety for many years. Had a nervous breakdown, I believe. And my mother, she was always… a worrier. Very prone to bouts of sadness. Whether that was proper depression, I couldn’t say, but she wasn’t a cheerful woman, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never been one for pills, if I’m honest. And allergies… just a little sensitivity to pollen, that’s all. Nothing serious. I’ve always been quite healthy, otherwise. This… this is new.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Derasmo, based on what you’ve described – the low mood, loss of enjoyment, changes in appetite and sleep, difficulty concentrating, and family history – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, we need to rule out any other potential causes. I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to be certain. And then I think some bloodwork is advisable.
PATIENT: Bloodwork… very well. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have commitments, you understand. But a physical exam… yes, alright. Just… please be quick about it. I’m not one for lingering, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. 140 over 88. A little elevated. And your pulse is 72, regular. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks normal here. Any recent weight loss, would you say?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. Not a drastic amount, but perhaps five or six pounds in the last few months? I haven't been keeping precise track, as I said. It’s just… my clothes feel a little looser, you see. It's hardly a major concern, though. I'm more bothered by the lack of energy, frankly.
DOCTOR: Approximately five to six pounds of weight loss. Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, I'll just do a quick assessment of your gait. Gait appears normal. Everything seems physically normal, which supports the possibility of depression, but again, we’ll confirm with bloodwork to rule out other causes like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. I’ll get the lab order sent over to the nurses, and they’ll come and take some blood.
PATIENT: Very good. The sooner this is done, the better. Thank you, Doctor. I trust the nurses will be efficient as well? I haven't got all day, you see.
DOCTOR: They are usually quite prompt, Mrs. Derasmo. While you're waiting for the nurses, is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe I’ve covered everything. I'm quite eager to get this sorted and get on with things. The bloodwork will suffice, I hope. I simply want to feel like myself again. If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just sit here quietly and wait.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Please let the nurses know if you have any questions while you wait. .
PATIENT: .
