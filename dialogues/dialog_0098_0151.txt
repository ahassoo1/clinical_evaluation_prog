DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… tingling. In my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to figure out what it is, if you can. I'm a simple woman, you know? Not looking for anything fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet… and you said it’s been going on for a little while. Could you tell me a bit more about that "little while"?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? It comes and goes, really. Some days it’s hardly noticeable, other days it feels like… pins and needles, all the time. It’s worse in the evenings, I think. And when I'm trying to sleep. It doesn't keep me up every night, but… it’s not pleasant, that’s for sure. I'm a mail carrier, you know, lots of walking. Could be that?
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, comes and goes, worse in the evenings and with sleep... and you mentioned your job as a mail carrier. Lots of walking, that’s good information. It could be related to your work, yes. We’ll need to explore other possibilities as well. Could you describe the tingling a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not pain, exactly. It’s more like… a buzzing, like when your foot falls asleep, but not as… numb. And it’s mostly in my fingertips and toes, but sometimes it goes up my hands and feet a bit. It’s hard to explain. It just feels… off. Like they’re not quite right. I hope that makes sense? I'm not good with describing things, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Teretha. No need to apologize at all. “Off” is a very good way to describe it. It's helpful to know it's not pain, and that it affects your fingertips and toes and sometimes travels up your hands and feet. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really. I haven’t dropped anything more than usual, and my walking feels… normal. I walk a lot, like I said, and haven't noticed anything different. Sometimes my feet are a bit tired at the end of the day, but that's just from the walking, I think. I've been doing this job for a long time, you know? I guess I’d notice if I was really weak, though. Would I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you likely would. It’s good that you haven’t noticed any significant weakness. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your skin on your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Changes in my skin… let me see. It's a little dry, maybe? I work outside a lot, rain or shine, and the weather's been funny lately. Not particularly flaky or anything. Just… normal, work-worn hands, I suppose. Nothing special. I put lotion on sometimes, but I forget. I really do forget things these days. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to forget things, Teretha. It happens to all of us. Dry skin can sometimes be related to nerve issues, so it’s good to ask, but it sounds like that’s likely just from your work. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical problems that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was no problem. And I get a bit of arthritis in my knees sometimes, but it’s not too bad. I take ibuprofen for it when it flares up. Other than that… no, I’m pretty healthy, actually. I’ve always been a strong woman. Never been one to complain. No insurance though, which is a problem. But that’s another story.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal some time ago, some arthritis in the knees, managed with ibuprofen. Thank you for letting me know. It's good you've been managing it. And I understand about the insurance situation. We’ll do our best to work with you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve taken all sorts of over-the-counter things over the years. Again, I really don’t think there’s anything… special about me, Doctor. Just an old woman who’s starting to feel a bit worn out.
DOCTOR: There's nothing wrong with feeling a bit worn out, Teretha. And everyone is special in their own way. One last question, for now. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No, just the ibuprofen when my knees bother me. That’s it. I try to take as little medication as possible, if I can. I don’t like feeling… foggy, if you know what I mean? So, no, nothing else. Are we getting somewhere? I really need to get back to work, you know. It piles up fast.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere. Thank you for answering all my questions. It's helpful to know you are only taking ibuprofen. Okay. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your reflexes, sensation, and strength in your hands and feet. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. But please, make it quick? I really have a lot of mail to sort. And I don’t want to be out too long. I just want to know what’s causing this tingling, and if it’s something serious. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your leg and let it just hang. I'm going to gently tap just below your knee. Okay… and now the other leg. Those seem normal. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. Can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just hurry, please. This is making me nervous. What if it’s something bad? I have to be strong for my family, you know. My grandson… he needs me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Teretha. We're just gathering information, and it's good you are strong for your family. Now, I’m going to lightly touch your fingertips with this. Can you tell me if you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, I feel it. A little bit… tingly. But I already feel tingling! It’s hard to tell. And it’s cold! It feels cold. Please just tell me what’s wrong. This is making me anxious. I don’t do well with waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I understand your anxiety, and I apologize if that was unpleasant. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There! Is that enough? Honestly, Doctor, I’m getting a headache. Can we please be done soon? I'm a mail carrier, not a patient! I'm used to being doing things, not having things done to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. That was sufficient. Your strength seems good, and your reflexes are normal. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, it’s difficult to say for certain what’s causing the tingling. It could be related to your job – repetitive movements can sometimes cause nerve compression. It could also be an early sign of neuropathy, which is nerve damage, often related to diabetes or vitamin deficiencies. And there are other possibilities as well. Because you have no other symptoms like weakness or significant pain, and your exam was mostly normal, I'm not overly concerned that it’s something immediately serious. However, we need to investigate further. Would you be willing to get a blood test to check your blood sugar, vitamin levels, and thyroid function?
PATIENT: Blood test… Oh, goodness. More waiting. More poking and prodding. Look, I don't have insurance, you know. How much is this going to cost? I'm a simple woman, I don't have a lot of money to throw around. And frankly, I'm starting to feel worse just being here. Is it really necessary? Maybe it will just go away on its own. Can’t I just try some lotion and rest?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Teretha. It's a valid point, and I wouldn't recommend anything unnecessary. Let’s do this: I'm going to write down a referral to a local lab that offers a discounted rate for patients without insurance. It won’t be free, but it will be significantly cheaper than a standard lab. In the meantime, trying lotion and rest is a good idea. If the tingling gets worse, or you develop any weakness, numbness, or pain, please contact me immediately. We can discuss the blood test results when you get them, and decide on a plan from there. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A discounted rate… Yes, that sounds… better. Much better. I appreciate that, Doctor. I just want to get back to normal, you know? Back to work. Okay. Yes, I'll go get the blood test. Give me the referral, and I'll try to get it done as soon as I can. And thank you… for not making me feel like I’m crazy. Some doctors just dismiss you, you know? Are we finally done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. You’re not crazy at all. It's good that you advocate for yourself. And yes, we are finally done. I’ll make a note in your chart to follow up with you after you get the results. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Here’s the referral. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
