DOCTOR: Hi Devin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Just… a cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And… there’s some stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. Not a lot, but… yeah. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some red… stuff when you cough. I understand why that would be worrying. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. First, how long have you had the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… long? A while now. Maybe… a couple weeks? Hard to say exactly. I don’t really… keep track. It started small, just a tickle, then got worse. The red stuff… that’s been maybe a week, I guess. Don’t really remember for sure. It all kinda… blends together.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks for the cough, and about a week for the red stuff. That’s helpful. And when you say “red stuff,” is that bright red, like it just happened, or is it darker, more like dried blood?
PATIENT: More… brighter, I think. Not dark. It’s… fresh-lookin’. Definitely not old. That’s why I came in, you know? Fresh red… that doesn’t seem right. I smoke, so I thought it might be that, but… it still worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood with your cough, and you smoke. That's good to know. We definitely want to investigate this further. Besides the cough and the blood, have you been experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not much, really. Tired, maybe. But I’m always tired. Been workin’ long hours, dispatchin’ power. That kinda takes it outta you. No fever, I don’t think. And no… chest pain, or nothin’ like that. Just… tired and this cough. It feels… deep, in my chest. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, a deep cough, and no fever or chest pain. That helps us narrow things down. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. Still eat the same. Maybe a little less, but that's just 'cause I'm tired and don’t feel like cookin'. Weight… haven’t weighed myself in a long time. Don't really bother with that stuff. I'm a little thinner, maybe, but I don't know for sure. It's hard to tell. Everything feels… off, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major changes in appetite, possibly a little weight loss, and just a general feeling of being "off." Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any chronic health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. The doctor back home… he just gave me pills for blood pressure a long time ago. But I stopped takin’ those. Made me feel weird. And… nothing else. I don’t go to the doctor much. Everything always seemed okay. Medicare checks me over once a year, but they don’t find nothin’. I'm… pretty healthy, I thought. Just this cough now. It’s new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were on blood pressure medication at one point but stopped due to side effects, and your Medicare checkups haven't revealed any other chronic conditions. Have you ever had any serious surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Never had surgery. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that's it. Just a cast. Nothing serious. I’m… lucky, I guess. Usually pretty tough. But this cough… it’s different. It feels bad. It’s makin’ me nervous. Can we just… find out what it is? I got things to do. Power’s gotta get to people, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Devin, and wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly. We will. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of lung problems, like COPD, asthma, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Lung problems… uh… my grandpa, on my mother’s side… he smoked his whole life. He got real sick, coughin’ a lot, but I don't know what he had. He died a long time ago. And… my aunt, she had some kinda trouble breathin’, but I don’t remember what it was. Everyone smoked back then, you know? It was… normal. I don't think anyone else had anything. Honestly, I don't really know much about their medical stuff. Is that important? Can we get to findin’ out what’s wrong with me now?
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandfather with a history of coughing and a aunt with breathing problems. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on, let’s quickly go over your current medications and allergies. Are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements, right now?
PATIENT: Nope. Not takin’ nothin’. Stopped the blood pressure pills a long time ago, like I said. And… no allergies. Never had any problems with that. So, can we do somethin’ now? An X-ray or somethin’? This talkin’… it’s not helpin’. Just wanna know what’s wrong, so I can get back to work. Power lines don't fix themselves, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Devin. You’re right, talking about it is just one part of figuring things out. Okay, no current medications or allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Hurry it up though. I got a schedule. Power's waitin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… in… and out. Okay. Now I’m going to listen to your heart. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from the coughing, or just some anxiety. Now, could I take a quick look at your throat?
PATIENT: Feels cold. Hurry up, I said. Just… quick, okay? This is… uncomfortable. I don't like doctors lookin’ in my mouth. It makes me… nervous. Just get it over with. Power's… waitin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks alright in your throat, just a little redness. So, based on what we’ve discussed and the quick exam, you've got a cough with some bright red blood, tiredness, and a history of smoking. Your lungs have some crackles, and your heart rate is a little elevated. Your throat is a bit red, but not severely inflamed. Now, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I would recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues like pneumonia or bronchitis, and a sputum sample to look for any signs of infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a… what was it? A spoo-tum sample? More tests. Just what I needed. Fine. Whatever. Just get it done. I got work to do. Is it gonna take long? And… will it hurt? I don’t do well with… things. Just tell me what I gotta do, and let’s get it over with. Power… it’s waitin’. Is there anything else? Anything else you need to poke and prod? I wanna go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. The X-ray won't hurt at all – you'll just stand in front of a machine while a picture is taken. The sputum sample involves coughing up a bit of mucus into a cup, which can be a little uncomfortable, but it's not painful. I'm going to send you down to radiology for the X-ray. Then, I’ll have the nurse show you how to collect the sputum sample. It’s best to do it first thing in the morning, after you’ve coughed up some mucus. In the meantime, I would like to get a complete blood count to rule out other potential issues. Nurse will draw a small amount of blood for that as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Blood, X-rays, spoo-tum… just get it done. Can I at least… sit down while I wait for this nurse? And… how long is this gonna take? I got a schedule to keep. Power’s waitin’. I just wanna know what’s wrong so I can go back to work. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. I completely understand. Please, have a seat. The nurse should be in shortly to take your blood, and then she will guide you to radiology for the X-ray. The whole process should take about an hour, maybe a little longer depending on how busy it is. I’ll review the results as soon as they're available and we can discuss them. I’m going to step out for a moment and let the nurse take care of you. Just let her know if you have any questions. I will be back as soon as I can. .
