DOCTOR: Right, Bianca Zicarelli. 63 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor Osga, good morning. Well, things just… not right, you know? I does be feeling so thirsty all the time. Like I drink a whole bucket of water and still feel dry. And I hungry too. Always hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't make sense.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… lots of people feel that way. Are you… exercising more than usual?
PATIENT: Exercising? No, Doctor. Not at all. I does work at the water pump, that’s all. Lifting the handle, that’s it. But that’s been the same for years, you know? It ain't like I start running marathon or anything. Just the pump. And it ain't making me this thirsty and hungry. This is… different.
DOCTOR: The pump, right. And how long has this "different" been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… maybe about a month now, Doctor. A month or so. It start slow, just a little more thirsty than usual. Then the hunger come. And now… now it's all the time. It’s tiring, you know? Always having to drink and eat. And still feeling… weak.
DOCTOR: Weakness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not like I can't do things, you understand. I still does my work at the pump. But after, I does feel… drained. Like all my energy gone. And sometimes, my vision does get a little blurry, you know? Not all the time, but it happen. Just a little… wobbly, everything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and weakness… Right. Have you noticed any changes in how often you're going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, Doctor, I have. I does be going more often, you know? Especially at night. Waking up, having to run to the bathroom. It's… inconvenient, to say the least. And the water… it's a lot, you know? More than usual. I thought maybe it was something I eat, but it keep happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be clear, no fever, no nausea, no vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no sickness in my stomach, and I ain't throw up nothing. Just the thirst, the hunger, the weakness, and going to the bathroom all the time. Everything else is… normal, I suppose. It just this. This is what bothering me. It’s… worrying me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it could be a number of things. Let’s do a quick blood sugar test, just to rule things out. It’s probably nothing, but we need to be sure. Sit down, please.
PATIENT: A blood sugar test? Okay, Doctor. If you think it best. I don’t mind. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? Is it going to hurt much? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: It’s just a tiny prick, it won’t hurt much at all. Okay… well. It's a bit high. 230. Not drastically high, but higher than it should be. We'll need to repeat this test. Have you ever been told you have diabetes before?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor. Never. Nobody in my family ever had diabetes, not that I know of. I always thought… I don't know… maybe it was the heat? We had a really hot spell last week. But… 230? What does that mean? Is that bad? I don't understand.
DOCTOR: It means your blood sugar is elevated. It could be temporary, stress, dehydration, something you ate. But it also could mean you have diabetes. We need to do a fasting blood sugar test to confirm. I’m going to schedule you for a lab test first thing tomorrow morning. You’ll need to fast – no eating or drinking after midnight. And I’m going to give you a referral to a specialist, just to be safe. It's better to get this checked out properly. Here. These are your instructions and the specialist's information. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… a specialist? Fasting? No eating? That sounds… serious, Doctor. I don’t know if I can fast, you know? I get shaky when I don’t eat. And what if it is diabetes? What does that mean? Will I… will I be sick? I just don't understand all of this. And… what about the pump? Will I still be able to work?
DOCTOR: Look, it's not a death sentence. Many people manage diabetes just fine. It means making some changes – diet, possibly medication. As for the pump, we’ll address that with the specialist. Right now, we need to confirm the diagnosis. Don't jump to conclusions. Just get the test done tomorrow morning. First thing. And then we'll talk. Honestly, people make such a fuss. It’s manageable. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… No, Doctor. I… I think that’s all. Thank you. I'll… I'll try to fast. And I'll go to the lab. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Goodbye. .
