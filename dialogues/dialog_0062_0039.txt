DOCTOR: Hi Lindsey, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Seems my numbers were a little high, the nurse told me. Cholesterol, she said. I don't rightly know what that means, to be honest with you. I just want to be sure I'm okay, you know? I'm 88 years old, and I'd like to stay that way a little longer!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Lindsey. It's good you're taking this seriously. And you're right to ask questions – it is important to understand what's going on. High cholesterol is something we can definitely look into and manage. When the nurse said your numbers were a little high, do you recall what specific numbers she mentioned, if any?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... She did say a few things. I remember a “two-something” and a “five-something”. Now, was it 240 and 150? Or maybe 140? It's awful what happens to your memory when you get older. I do remember she said something about good and bad cholesterol, and that the “bad” one was too high. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: That does help quite a bit, actually. It sounds like she might have been referring to your total cholesterol, your LDL and possibly your HDL . Memory can definitely be tricky! Let me pull up your results here to be certain... Okay, yes, your total cholesterol is 242, your LDL is 158, and your HDL is 42. Those numbers are a little elevated, as the nurse mentioned. To get a better understanding of what's going on and how best to address this, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… well, I've been pretty lucky, actually. I had the measles as a kid, and a bout of pneumonia when I was maybe fifty, but that was a long time ago. My wife, bless her soul, she had some trouble with her heart towards the end, but I’ve never had anything serious myself. I used to work down at the factory, supervising folks, but mostly I just kept things running smooth. I retired about twenty years ago now. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, to be honest. Just for check-ups. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. No major illnesses, that's good to know. Pneumonia that long ago shouldn't be a concern now. And it's good you haven’t had any heart problems yourself. Working at the factory is useful context. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… surgeries… now that’s a good question. Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, maybe seven or eight years old. And… and I broke my arm once, playing baseball. They set it, put it in a cast, that was about it. Nothing major since then. My wife had a hip replacement a few years before she passed, but that wasn’t me, of course. Does that cover it? I'm trying to think if there was anything else, but my mind is a bit foggy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that covers it perfectly. Tonsils and a broken arm – that’s all we need to know for your surgical history. It's perfectly normal for things to be a little foggy, don’t worry about it. Now, thinking about your family… are there any heart conditions, high cholesterol, or diabetes that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family… that’s a tough one. My mother, she lived a long life, but I don’t really remember her having any major problems. She was a strong Swedish woman. My father died young, from a flu, I think, but he wasn’t much for doctors, so we didn't really talk about health much. My wife’s side… her brother had some trouble with his heart, I think, but I can’t remember exactly what. He was a bit of a drinker, to be honest. I suppose that could have contributed. It's hard to say, really. We didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. A bit of heart trouble on your wife's side, and your father passing young, but otherwise not a lot of clear history. That’s alright; we work with what we have. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My wife hated the smell of it. And I always figured it was just a bad habit anyway. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette. I used to drink a beer or two with dinner sometimes, but I cut back on that a few years ago. My stomach doesn't handle it as well as it used to. Mostly, I just drink water these days. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking. That’s great that you’ve never smoked, and good that you’ve cut back on the alcohol. So, a beer or two with dinner occasionally in the past, but mostly water now?
PATIENT: That's right. A beer now and then. Not every night, mind you. I try to eat pretty healthy, too. Lots of vegetables, a little bit of meat. My wife was a wonderful cook, she taught me to appreciate good food. We used to garden, too, which was nice. Fresh tomatoes, cucumbers… it was a good life. But it's just me now, so I don't cook as much anymore. Mostly just simple things.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. It's good to hear you eat a healthy diet and used to garden. And I understand things change when you're on your own. Okay, one last quick question, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… let me think. No, I don't believe so. Never had any trouble with any medications, as far as I can remember. No allergies to foods, either. No bee stings, poison ivy, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky, in that regard. I can't recall a time I've ever had a reaction to anything. Does that help? I'm trying to be thorough, you know. I want to make sure I'm telling you everything you need to know.
DOCTOR: That's great to know, and yes, that's very helpful! No known allergies is wonderful. Okay, Lindsey, with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I may be an old man, but I still want to be around a little while longer. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I don't think there will be, but it's good to ask, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will definitely let you know before I do anything, and please, stop me if anything does feel uncomfortable at any point. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 82. That's a little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur, which is not uncommon at your age. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are a little weak in your feet, but present. And finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common as we get older. So, overall, everything seems within the range of what I'd expect for someone your age, but there are a few things we need to address. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your LDL cholesterol is elevated, as the nurse mentioned. The weak pulses in your feet warrant further investigation, too.
PATIENT: Well, that sounds like a mouthful! A little high here, a little weak there… What does all that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I don’t want to end up bedridden or anything. And what can we do about it? I'm a practical man, I like to know what's going on and what needs to be fixed. Just tell me straight, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, and I'm happy to explain things straight, as you say. The high blood pressure and high LDL cholesterol are both risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Over time, they can damage your blood vessels and make it harder for your heart to pump blood. The weak pulses in your feet could indicate a build-up of plaque in your arteries, reducing blood flow. It’s not necessarily serious right now, but it’s something we need to address to prevent problems down the line. We don’t want to wait until it becomes serious. The good news is, we have several options to help manage this. We can start with lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise. Reducing your salt intake, eating a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular physical activity can make a big difference. We can also discuss medication options to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure if lifestyle changes aren’t enough. To get a clearer picture of what's going on with those pulses in your feet, I’d also like to order a few tests. An ankle-brachial index test is a simple, non-invasive test that can measure blood flow in your legs. I might also recommend a lipid panel to get a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels, and an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Tests, lifestyle changes, maybe some pills… it's not what I wanted to hear, but I understand. I suppose I’ve been a bit lax about taking care of myself lately. Getting old makes you think you're invincible, I guess. The ankle thing and the heart test sound… a little scary, but if it's what needs to be done, I'm willing. And I can certainly try to eat better. My wife always said I needed to lay off the salt, anyway. So, what's the first step? Do I need to schedule another appointment for these tests, or can we do them here today? And what about the pills? What are we talking about, if it comes to that? I've always been a little wary of medication.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible attitude, Lindsey. It's never too late to start taking care of yourself. Yes, let's schedule you for those tests. We can do the ABI test right here in the office today. It just involves taking blood pressure readings on your ankle and your arm, and comparing the results. It takes about 15-20 minutes. For the lipid panel, we'll need to draw some blood, and we can schedule that for tomorrow morning. As for the EKG, we can do that at the same time as the blood draw. Now, regarding medication, let's hold off on that for now. We want to see what impact lifestyle changes have first. If those aren’t enough, we can discuss options. The most common medications for high cholesterol are statins, and for high blood pressure, there are several different classes of medications, such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics. I'll explain all the risks and benefits before making any decisions, and we'll start with the lowest possible dose. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough. Tests today, blood tomorrow, and hold off on the pills for now. I like that approach. Starting slow is always best, I reckon. So, let’s get these tests done. What do I need to do for the ankle thing? Do I need to wear special shoes, or anything like that? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood draw tomorrow? Should I fast, or avoid anything in particular? I want to make sure I do it right. You know, old habits… I sometimes forget things.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good plan, and don't worry about forgetting things, it happens to the best of us! For the ABI test, you don't need to do anything special. Just wear comfortable shoes – whatever you normally wear. No special preparation required at all. For the blood draw tomorrow, yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. You can still take your regular medications, unless I specifically tell you otherwise. It’s important to be well-hydrated, though, so drink plenty of water the day before and the morning of the test. I'll have the nurse schedule you for the ABI test right now, and she can also give you a paper with instructions for the blood draw. In the meantime, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. You've been very patient and explained everything clearly. I appreciate that. It’s good to know I’m in good hands. Alright, let’s get this testing done. I’ll see what the nurse says about scheduling. And I’ll try to lay off the food tomorrow. It might be hard, but I’ll do my best. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a lot better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindsey. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re a team in this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns at any time. The nurse will be right with you to schedule that ABI test. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you tomorrow morning for the blood draw.
