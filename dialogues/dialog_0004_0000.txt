DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's about my legs, really. They just…gave out, more or less. Happened after a pretty bad cold. Not giving out giving out, thankfully, but very weak. It's unsettling, you know? I'm usually very active.
DOCTOR: Weakness, after a cold. Alright. Can you tell me more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, please. "Weakness" doesn't quite cover it. It’s like trying to wade through molasses, especially when I first try to stand. And it’s both legs, which is…odd. I mean, usually things affect one side more than the other, doesn't it? It started maybe three days ago, just a little wobbly, but today getting out of bed was a real struggle. I had to practically haul myself up. And it doesn't get much better as the day goes on, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Usually" is right, Ms. Firestone. Though the body isn’t always so obliging as to follow the rules. Three days ago, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Though I suppose it could have been a little longer, I'm not meticulously tracking every little wobble, Doctor. I have a life, you know. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual…slipping away of strength. And it's frustrating, because I had plans! A trip, actually. I don't appreciate being inconvenienced.
DOCTOR: A trip. Yes, inconvenience is never ideal. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this so we can get you back on track. You mentioned a cold beforehand. Do you recall any other symptoms with the cold?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. A proper cold. Stuffy nose, the usual aches, a terrible cough that wouldn't let up for days... the whole nine yards. I even had a bit of a fever, nothing alarming, but enough to make me feel utterly miserable for about a week. It just seemed to be fading when this leg business started. I really thought I was on the mend, and then this. Honestly, it feels like one thing after another.
DOCTOR: And, Ms. Firestone, did you notice where in your legs the weakness is most prominent?
PATIENT: Well, that's a silly question, isn't it? It's…everywhere! But, if you must know details, it's worse in my thighs, I think. Like trying to lift weights with cooked spaghetti. And it feels…tingly, sometimes, not constantly, but enough to be annoying. It's difficult to explain. It's just…weak. All over. And really, I'd prefer to be getting on with my life, if you don’t mind. I'm not one for dwelling on every little sensation.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your frustration, truly. However, these "little sensations," as you call them, are important. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Don't tell me you need to know everything. Pre-existing conditions... well, I have high blood pressure, it’s been under control for years with medication. Nothing else, really. I'm generally quite healthy, despite everything. I watch what I eat, I stay active… or used to, before my legs decided to betray me. The doctor before just kept saying "watch your salt intake" like that was the answer to everything. It's hardly a sophisticated diagnosis, is it?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed. And you're taking medication for it currently?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I am. What do you think I've been doing, ignoring it? A small pill every morning. Lisinopril, I believe it's called. And I fill the prescription regularly. I'm not careless, Doctor. Honestly, I find these questions a little…demeaning. I’m a responsible adult.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I assure you I am not attempting to demean you. These questions are standard procedure. It's crucial for me to have a complete picture of your health. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Allergies? No. None that I’m aware of, and frankly, if I had one, I'd likely know, wouldn't I? I haven’t collapsed mysteriously after taking a pill in, well, ever. I suppose a mild reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but that was decades ago. Is that important? Really? I think we're wasting time here. My legs aren't getting any stronger just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy, noted. Alright. And what about past surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. A tonsillectomy when I was seven, a rather unpleasant experience. And… a C-section with my daughter, almost thirty years ago now. That's about it. I’m not a fan of hospitals, so I avoid them whenever possible. This is already two procedures too many, if you ask me. Frankly, I’m starting to regret coming in at all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your frustration, but refusing to provide necessary details hinders my ability to assist you effectively. Now, regarding your family history… any significant medical conditions among your parents or siblings?
PATIENT: Oh, good grief. Family history. Well, my mother had arthritis, quite bad towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart problems, though he was a smoker, so you can imagine. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know, though we don’t see much of each other. Honestly, I doubt that information is terribly relevant. I’m starting to feel quite patronized, Doctor. Are you even listening to me? I just want to know what's wrong with my legs.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, it is my job to gather all relevant information, even if you deem it unimportant. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Are you fishing now? I do not smoke. Never have, never will. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s it. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I have some standards, you know. This is becoming rather insulting, Doctor. I came here for a medical opinion, not an interrogation. I assure you, my lifestyle is not contributing to this… leg problem. It’s probably just a virus. A nasty one, but a virus nonetheless. Can we please move on to some sort of examination? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please step over to the examination table. I'll need you to lie down. We’ll start with a neurological assessment. I’ll be checking your reflexes and muscle strength.
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Just be gentle, Doctor. I'm not as nimble as I used to be, apparently. And try to be quick about it, if you don’t mind. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. We’ll start with your reflexes. Relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are… diminished bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to resist as I try to move your legs. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Resist? Of course I can resist. I’m not a… a noodle. There. I'm resisting. It’s… harder than it looks, actually. Feels like trying to push against a brick wall. Is that good enough? I told you I was weak. This isn’t exactly a revelation.
DOCTOR: Strength is markedly diminished in both legs, particularly in the thighs and lower legs. 3/5 strength bilaterally. No significant tenderness to palpation. Slight edema in both ankles. Sensory function appears intact. Alright, Ms. Firestone. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. It all feels rather… cursory, doesn’t it? A quick tap here, a quick listen there. I was hoping for something a little more… thorough. Honestly, I’ve had more comprehensive check-ups at the dentist.
DOCTOR: Auscultation reveals mild crackles in both lung bases, but nothing significant. Ms. Firestone, based on the examination, your symptoms and the findings, several possibilities come to mind. It's unlikely to be solely a virus. The diminished reflexes, muscle weakness, edema, and crackles in your lungs suggest something more complex. We need to rule out several things. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. I’m also ordering an MRI of your spine to rule out any nerve compression.
PATIENT: An MRI? Good heavens. An MRI? That sounds… excessive, doesn’t it? Is that really necessary? I just have weak legs! And you’re making it sound like I’m about to expire. I don’t like being poked and prodded, and I definitely don’t like being squeezed into a machine. Honestly, are you sure you've considered every other possibility? Perhaps another blood test, a different kind of scan… Anything to avoid an MRI. It sounds dreadful. Is it painful? And how long does it take? This is all very unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your apprehension, but it is crucial we investigate thoroughly. These tests are necessary to rule out serious conditions like multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, or spinal cord compression. Ignoring these possibilities could have severe consequences. The MRI is not painful, although it requires you to lie still for about 30-45 minutes in a confined space. We’ll provide you with earplugs and a sedative if you are claustrophobic. I'm not making this decision lightly. It is standard procedure given your presentation. While we await the results, I am prescribing you a low-dose corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and potentially alleviate some of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Corticosteroids… I've heard things about those. Side effects, weight gain… Honestly, this is becoming increasingly alarming. And you're talking about multiple sclerosis and… what was the other one? I’m perfectly capable of researching these conditions myself, you know, and frankly, the internet is painting a rather bleak picture. I don't appreciate being subjected to this… this doom and gloom. And as for lying still in a machine for forty-five minutes… I think not. Absolutely not. I'm a busy woman, Doctor. I have commitments, plans… I simply do not have time for this. Can't we try something else first? Perhaps physical therapy? Or a different medication? Surely there's another option. This feels… rushed. And rather drastic.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your concerns and your desire for a less invasive approach. However, the symptoms you're experiencing warrant a comprehensive investigation. Physical therapy would be beneficial after we establish a definitive diagnosis, not before. Starting corticosteroids without knowing the underlying cause could mask the symptoms and delay proper treatment. And frankly, the potential risks of delaying treatment for serious conditions like multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barré syndrome far outweigh the discomfort of an MRI. I’m ordering the MRI. The lab results will give us additional information, but the MRI is essential. I'm also referring you to a neurologist for a second opinion. They will review the results with you and discuss further treatment options. I’m not dismissing your concerns, Ms. Firestone, but I have a duty to provide you with the best possible care, and that requires a thorough investigation. Do you have any questions about the tests or the referral?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Of course. One doctor wasn’t enough. Fine. Do the MRI. But if it finds something… dreadful… I want all the options explained to me, in plain English, not medical jargon. And I expect a second, and a third opinion, if necessary. I'm not letting anyone rush me into anything. And as for this neurologist… are they any good? I don't want to be subjected to another round of poking and prodding from someone who doesn’t know what they're doing. Honestly, this whole experience is… deeply unpleasant. I just want my legs to work again. Is that too much to ask? And when can I expect these results? I don’t want to be left in the dark for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Firestone. And I assure you, I will do everything I can to ensure you receive the best possible care. The neurologist I’m referring you to is Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected specialist in the field. I’ve worked with her extensively, and she is excellent at explaining complex medical information in a clear and concise manner. The MRI results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I receive them, I will contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm prescribing you a short course of prednisone to help reduce inflammation and hopefully alleviate some of your symptoms. Here are the referral to Dr. Ramirez and the prescription for prednisone. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or develop any new symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Firestone?
PATIENT: Prednisone… I've read about the side effects. Weight gain, mood swings… Wonderful. No. I think that's enough for now. I just want to go home and lie down. And try not to think about multiple sclerosis. Thank you… I suppose. I’ll schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez… eventually. And I’ll try not to fall down in the meantime. Goodbye, Doctor. .
