DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve just been feeling…chilly. Like, not feverish, just really cold. It started a couple of days ago and it hasn’t really gone away. It's a bit weird for August, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed it is. Chilly, you say. And has this been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Like, sometimes I’m perfectly fine, and then other times I just get these…waves of cold. Especially in the evenings. And my hands get really cold, even if it’s not that cold in the room. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. And are you experiencing anything else along with these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really. No aches, no cough, no sore throat. I’ve been a little tired, maybe, but honestly, who isn’t these days? I guess…maybe a tiny bit of a headache, but it's nothing major. Like a pressure headache, if that makes sense? It comes and goes with the chills, maybe.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A pressure headache coinciding with the chills is worth noting. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really. My appetite's been normal, I think. And my weight… I haven't weighed myself in a while, to be honest. Probably stayed about the same. I've been trying to eat healthier, but… life gets in the way, you know? No big changes there, though.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep's been okay, I guess. I don't have trouble falling asleep, but I don't always sleep through the night. I wake up a few times, sometimes. Nothing terrible, just… restless. And sometimes I feel a bit tired when I wake up, even if I've slept for a decent amount of time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear. Intermittent sleep is quite common. Now, Jailenne, to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… nothing major, really. I had chickenpox as a kid, that’s about it. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. Oh, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been managed with medication. I take a small dose, and it seems to be working okay. I see my regular doctor for check-ups every six months. Other than that… pretty healthy, I think. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, that's helpful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mum has arthritis, and my dad had diabetes. Nothing else really stands out. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. It’s not a particularly medical family, thankfully. Is that helpful? I mean, is there anything specific you want to know? It’s just… my family isn't really the type to talk about their health problems, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright. Family history can be difficult to gather. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, definitely not. I don't smoke, and I don't do drugs. Never have. I do drink sometimes, maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week, but that's it. I try to keep things pretty moderate. What about caffeine? I drink coffee, maybe one or two cups a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what do you do for work or school, Jailenne?
PATIENT: I'm a Health Education Specialist. So, it's a bit ironic, really, coming here feeling unwell! I work with people in the community, trying to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent illnesses. It's pretty rewarding, but it can be stressful sometimes. I've been doing it for a few years now. Do you need to know anything specific about my work?
DOCTOR: No, that is helpful, thank you. It is rather fitting, isn't it?
PATIENT: It is a bit funny, isn't it? Like, I teach people about health, and here I am complaining about being chilly! Honestly, it's been a bit embarrassing. I just want to figure out what's going on. Could it be something simple, like a cold, even though I don't have any other symptoms?
DOCTOR: It is understandable to feel a bit frustrated, and yes, it could be a mild viral illness, even with limited symptoms. To help me assess, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay? I'm a little squeamish, to be honest! But I want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything as I go and stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. First, I’d like to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I appreciate you explaining everything beforehand, it definitely makes me feel a bit better. I think my mum always said prevention is better than cure, so I'm glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular and strong. Blood pressure is 128/80, which is well-controlled. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Throat appears clear, no visible signs of infection or inflammation. Based on the exam, there are no obvious signs of acute illness. However, the persistent chills are concerning enough to warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay, that… that sounds good, I guess. No obvious signs of anything wrong is good, right? But… further investigation? What does that involve? Is it something serious? I’m starting to feel a little anxious now. Sorry, I didn’t mean to… I just get worried easily. What are you thinking?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Jailenne, and I completely understand your concern. “Further investigation” simply means we may need to run some blood tests to rule out potential causes for the chills. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or a mild thyroid issue. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. Would you be comfortable with a blood draw?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. I guess so. It's better to know, right? I’m not a huge fan of needles, but… I can handle it. As long as it's not too painful. What kind of tests are you thinking of? And… how long do I have to wait for the results? I have a pretty busy week, so knowing roughly when I’ll get them back would be helpful. Sorry to ask so many questions, I just like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Jailenne. It's important to understand what’s happening, and being prepared is always a good idea. I’d like to order a Complete Blood Count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to assess your thyroid function, and a Vitamin D level to rule out a deficiency. These are all relatively simple blood tests. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I'll review them carefully and contact you to discuss the results and next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. 24 to 48 hours isn’t too bad. CBC, TSH, and Vitamin D… Okay, I’ll try to remember that. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, avoid certain foods or activities? I don't want to mess up the results or anything. And… where do I go for the blood draw? Is it here in the clinic? I hope it's not too far. Sorry, I'm just thinking ahead!
DOCTOR: You're very thoughtful, Jailenne. No, there’s nothing specific you need to avoid in the meantime. Eat and drink as you normally would. The blood draw will be done right here in the clinic. Just take this to the lab technician, who is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. It should only take a few minutes. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to prepare for the blood draw?
PATIENT: Down the hall… okay, good. That's easy enough. No, I think I’m okay. Just down the hall. No special preparations… Okay, that's a relief. I was worried I'd have to fast or something. I'm not a fan of fasting. So, just go down the hall, give them this, and they’ll do the blood draw. And then I wait for you to call with the results in a couple of days. Is that right? I just want to make sure I've got it all straight. I’m really trying not to be a bother! It’s just… being unwell is a bit unsettling. I like to know what’s going on, you know?
DOCTOR: You've got it perfectly straight, Jailenne. Yes, just head down the hall to the lab. They will take care of the blood draw, and then I’ll contact you within 24 to 48 hours with the results. And you’re not a bother at all. It’s my job to explain everything clearly and address any concerns you may have. I understand it’s unsettling to feel unwell, and it's perfectly natural to want answers. Do you feel comfortable heading to the lab now, or would you like me to assist you?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay. I can find my way down the hall. I don't want to take up any more of your time. You've been very patient with me. Thank you. Hopefully, it's just a vitamin deficiency or something simple. And hopefully, the results come back quickly. Okay. Well, thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. I appreciate your help. I’ll see you when you call with the results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before I contact you. Get well soon, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
