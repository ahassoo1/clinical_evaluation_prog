DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this pain. When I breathe deep, you know? It hurts. It’s… hard to explain. Been happening a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some pain when you take a deep breath. That can be concerning. When you say "a little while now," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe a month? Two? It all kinda blends together these days. It's not constant, though. Comes and goes. Not a sharp pain, more of a… ache. Deep down. Does that make any sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Ruocco. It’s alright to not be precise; we'll figure it out together. An ache that comes and goes with deep breaths, lasting about a month or two. Is the ache on one side of your chest, or both?
PATIENT: Both sides, I think. Or… maybe it starts on one side and then goes to the other? Honestly, Doctor, it’s hard to tell. I get a little dizzy sometimes too, but I don’t know if that’s related. I just figured it was my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, both sides, potentially starting on one side. And you've noticed some dizziness as well. It’s good you mentioned the dizziness. Let's explore that a bit further. When do you feel dizzy?
PATIENT: When I stand up too fast, usually. Or… if I bend over to pick something up. Not all the time, mind you. Just… sometimes. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. I don't really do much bending over these days, anyway. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, dizziness with quick changes in position – standing up quickly or bending over. And it resolves quickly. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite hasn't been the best, I guess. Not eating as much as I used to. And… I've been a little more tired than usual. But, like I said, I’m eighty years old! I'm bound to be tired. Everything hurts, you know? I just want to get this pain figured out.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Mr. Ruocco. Reduced appetite and increased fatigue are good things to mention. Alright, let’s do a quick examination. I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… don't take too long, okay? I have things I need to… well, I forget what, but things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll be as quick as I can. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Again… good. Now, your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Lung sounds are slightly diminished in the bases bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles are appreciated at this time. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs noted. I’m going to have you sit up now. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: No, no pain sitting up. Just… a little winded, maybe. But that’s probably just because I haven't been doing much walking lately. Everything feels harder these days, you know? It’s… frustrating. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ruocco. It's good that we've ruled out any immediate concerns during the examination. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination findings, it could be a few things. The diminished lung sounds, along with the chest pain and fatigue, suggest possibilities like mild pneumonia, bronchitis, or even some age-related changes in your lungs. The dizziness could be related to low blood pressure changes with position, but we want to rule out other causes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t want to cause too much trouble. And a blood count, you said? Will that take long? I just… I don’t have insurance, Doctor. Will this be very expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll do our best to keep things as economical as possible. The chest X-ray and blood count will give us important information to help determine the cause of your symptoms. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. As for the cost, let me see if we have any programs or assistance available for patients without insurance. I'll have my nurse check on that for you while we proceed. Nurse Mai, could you please look into any financial assistance programs for Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That would be very kind of you. I appreciate it. It’s just… everything is so expensive these days. I didn't used to worry about things like this so much. Alright, let’s get the tests done, then. If it helps figure out what’s wrong, I guess it’s worth it. But please, don’t take too long. I… I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. We'll get this done as quickly and comfortably as possible. Nurse Mai will come in shortly to draw your blood for the complete blood count. After that, we’ll get you over to the radiology department for the chest X-ray. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we’ll discuss the next steps then. In the meantime, if your pain worsens, or you develop a fever, or experience any shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
