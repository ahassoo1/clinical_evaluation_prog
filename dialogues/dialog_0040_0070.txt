DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Szmyd, let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Is… is this the place for the… the check-up? New in town, you see. Everything is so… confusing. Medicare sent me. Something about a visit. I don't remember much, honestly. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is the place. Medicare…right. And you’re here for your annual wellness visit. Though, frankly, I have a lot of patients. "Don't remember much," you say?
PATIENT: Annual… yes, that sounds right. Wellness. Is that like… they poke you? I don't like poking. And I remember things, just… not all things. Important things, mostly. Like… good makeup. I used to do makeup for… performers. Big names, you wouldn't believe. Though, now… what was I saying? Oh. The poking.
DOCTOR: It involves… assessment, Mr. Szmyd. We need to check things. Blood pressure, heart, lungs, the usual. It's not just about "poking," it's about making sure everything is working. Now, let's start with why you thought you needed to come in today. Forget the performers for now. Any specific symptoms bothering you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmph. No. Not really. I feel… old. Is that a symptom? Everything aches a little. Like a dull… weight. And sometimes I forget where I put my glasses. But that happens all the time. My ex-wife used to yell about that. Terrible woman. No, no symptoms, really. Just… existing. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: "Existing" isn’t a symptom, Mr. Szmyd. Alright. Dull aches... where specifically?
PATIENT: Everywhere, mostly. Back, knees… shoulders. It's just… age, I tell you! Like a rusty machine. Though, my back… maybe a little worse lately. When I bend over. It's not a sharp pain, just… a protest. A loud, creaky protest. Like an old door. You understand? Old things creak.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand old things creak. We'll get this over with. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Ugh. Stand up. Fine. Be careful, I'm not as steady as I used to be. My balance isn’t the best. Everything is falling apart, you know. It's a tragedy, really. A beautiful man, wasted.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just stand still. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply. Heart rate is… regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, though you do seem a bit… wheezy. Back… Tenderness in the lumbar region. Not acute, but definitely some discomfort. BMI is 29.9, bordering on obese. What medications are you currently taking, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Obese? I am not obese! A little… full-bodied, perhaps. But not obese. And full-bodied men are more… distinguished. Medications… hmm. Let me think. The doctor… the other doctor, back in the city… gave me something for my… the water. The swelling in my legs. A white pill, I think. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep… a little something for that. But I don't remember the names. It all blurs together. Old age, again. It’s a curse, I tell you. A terrible, terrible curse.
DOCTOR: Right. “Something for the water.” Wonderful. Do you know the dosage of either of these medications?
PATIENT: Dosage? No. Absolutely not. I just… take them. When I remember. The doctor told me how much, of course. But that was… a long time ago. I don’t keep track of these things. My ex-wife used to handle all that. And she wasn't very good at explaining, always yelling and rushing. Honestly, it’s a mess. I think one was… a small pill, once a day? And the other… maybe two? I don't know! Why do you need to know all this? It’s just… pills.
DOCTOR: Because, Mr. Szmyd, knowing what pills you're taking is rather important! We need to make sure they aren't interacting with each other, or causing any side effects. It's basic medical practice. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. I used to get a rash from cheap lipstick, but that was decades ago. And that wasn’t a real allergy, just… bad quality makeup. My ex-wife always bought the cheapest stuff. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I'm a robust man. I can handle anything. A little rash isn’t an allergy. It’s just… sensitivity. Honestly, this is all very stressful. Can we just… finish this? I have things to do, you know. Important things. Though, what those things are… escapes me.
DOCTOR: Fine. I'm going to order some basic blood work, including a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. We need to check your kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. I’m also going to order a urinalysis. And I’m referring you to a specialist for a more thorough evaluation of your lower back pain. I’ll also send you home with a handout on healthy eating and exercise. You really should try to improve your diet and get some regular physical activity. It’ll make a difference. Here. These are your lab orders, and this is the handout. And here’s the referral to the specialist. They will call you to schedule an appointment. Anything else?
PATIENT: Specialist? More appointments? No. No, I don’t think so. All this… poking and prodding and tests… it’s exhausting. Honestly, I just wanted to make sure everything was… still there. You know? Still functioning. But now it's all this… hassle. Fine. I’ll… look at them later. Probably. Though, I have a feeling they’ll just confuse me. And I really should get going. Do you… know a good place to get a decent coffee around here? That's all I really need right now. A strong, black coffee. And maybe a little something sweet. This whole ordeal has been terribly draining. .
DOCTOR: There's a cafe down the street, a couple of blocks that way. Can’t vouch for the coffee, frankly. Next. .
