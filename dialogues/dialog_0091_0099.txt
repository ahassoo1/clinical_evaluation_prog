DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe it was called an Endo test. And it seems… abnormal. I’m a little worried, to be frank. I received a letter, but frankly, I’m not one to decipher medical language.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your concern, Ms. Minatra, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel worried when receiving results you don't fully understand. An “Endo test” likely refers to an endoscopy, a procedure where we use a small camera to view the inside of your digestive tract. Just to confirm, is that Denis Minatra, date of birth...?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Denis Minatra. And my date of birth is… let me see… October 14th, 1957. Is that right? I do try to remember these things, but… well, one gets older, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Minatra, that confirms your information. Thank you. Okay, I see the results of your esophagogastroduodenoscopy, performed on July 12th of this year. The report does indicate some abnormalities. Specifically, it notes evidence of mild esophagitis and some small polyps in the stomach. To help me understand your situation better, could you describe any symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Esophagitis… polyps… Symptoms… well, that’s a good question. I suppose I have had a bit of heartburn lately. Not terribly severe, just… uncomfortable after meals. And sometimes, a little bit of bloating. But honestly, Doctor, I thought that was just… age. Or perhaps something I ate. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Minatra. Heartburn and bloating can certainly be related to the findings in your endoscopy report. To clarify, how often would you say you experience this heartburn?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not every day, certainly. Perhaps… two or three times a week? Sometimes more if I eat something… rich. Or spicy. I do enjoy a good mole, you see, and perhaps that contributes. It’s usually manageable with a little antacid, though. Nothing serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand. And do you notice any difficulty swallowing, or any pain when you do swallow?
PATIENT: No, not really. No difficulty swallowing at all. And no pain, not specifically. Sometimes, a little bit of… discomfort, as I said, after eating. But not pain. It’s more of a… burning sensation, if anything. And that goes away fairly quickly with the antacids. I've been using those for years, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, my appetite is… quite good, actually. I enjoy my food, and I eat regularly. Perhaps a little too regularly, my daughter tells me! No loss of appetite, no. I haven’t been feeling unwell enough to lose interest in a good meal.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Minatra. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Perhaps… thirty years ago now? And I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but nothing major. Otherwise, I’ve been… remarkably healthy, all things considered. I try to take good care of myself. I walk every morning, and I eat a balanced diet, mostly. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Gallbladder removal is good to know. And no other significant medical diagnoses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else that I can recall. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no heart problems… I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. My mother, she lived to be ninety-five, so perhaps I inherited some good genes. Although, she did have terrible arthritis… but that’s a different story entirely.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know, Ms. Minatra. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit more complicated. My mother, as I said, had arthritis. My father… he passed away fairly young, from a heart attack, I believe. And my brother… he had some stomach troubles when he was younger, but I don’t recall the specifics. He’s… no longer with us. It wasn't anything serious, I don’t think. Just… discomfort. Nothing like this, I assure you. It was a long time ago, and my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Minatra. Now, let’s briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, absolutely not! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Goodness, no! I am a woman of… certain principles, you see. I prefer a good book and a quiet evening at home. Much safer, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. That's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've taken various medications over the years – antibiotics for infections, pain relievers for headaches – and never had any problems. Though, I do have a bit of a sensitivity to strong perfumes, sometimes. They give me a headache. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not an allergy. Alright, Ms. Minatra, thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall condition.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, proceed. I do hope it won't be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Minatra. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender to palpation in all four quadrants. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Mild guarding noted with deep palpation in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness.
PATIENT: That… that was quite gentle, Doctor. Thank you. I did feel a little bit of discomfort just then, in the upper part of my stomach, as you were pressing. But it wasn’t… sharp. Just… uncomfortable, as I mentioned before. Is that… significant?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Minatra. The mild discomfort in the epigastric region, combined with the findings from your endoscopy report, suggests a possible degree of gastritis or esophagitis. The polyps also warrant further investigation. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I recommend a follow-up endoscopy with biopsies to determine the cause of the inflammation and assess the nature of the polyps. We’ll need to rule out any possibility of Helicobacter pylori infection, and ensure there are no precancerous changes. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Biopsies… Helicobacter pylori… It sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something I should be very worried about? I understand you need to investigate, of course, but… What exactly would the biopsies involve? And is this Helicobacter thing… contagious? I wouldn’t want to put anyone at risk.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Minatra. While the findings require investigation, it doesn't necessarily mean it’s something to be overly alarmed about. Many people have gastritis or esophagitis, and often it can be managed effectively with medication and lifestyle changes. The biopsy involves taking a small tissue sample during the endoscopy. It’s generally painless, as it’s performed while you’re sedated. The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. As for Helicobacter pylori, it is a bacterial infection, and it can be spread through contaminated food or water, or close contact with infected individuals. However, it's not highly contagious, and it's easily treated with antibiotics. We’d take appropriate precautions to prevent transmission if the tests indicate you have the infection. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Sedated… that sounds… better. Less unpleasant, certainly. And easily treated, you say? That’s… reassuring. If it’s easily treatable, then I suppose I should proceed with the endoscopy and the biopsies. Yes, I think that’s best. I would rather know, and address the problem if there is a problem. But… what about the cost? I am… not insured, Doctor. Would this be very expensive?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Minatra. I understand that the cost of medical procedures can be significant, especially without insurance. Let me see… a diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies typically costs around $1500 to $2000, depending on the complexity of the procedure and the laboratory fees. However, our clinic does offer a financial assistance program for uninsured patients. We can explore that option for you, and potentially arrange a payment plan. We also have a patient navigator who can assist you with the application process and explore other resources that may be available to help cover the costs. Would you like me to connect you with our patient navigator?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be… incredibly helpful, Doctor. Truly. A payment plan would be wonderful, and the patient navigator sounds like a godsend. I wouldn't know where to begin otherwise. Yes, please, connect me with the patient navigator. And… thank you. For explaining everything so clearly, and for being so understanding. I feel much better now, knowing there are options available.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. I’ve sent a message to our patient navigator, and they will contact you within 24 hours to discuss your financial options and schedule the endoscopy. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to manage your symptoms with antacids as needed, and avoiding foods that trigger heartburn. Do you have any final questions for me before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I appreciate your patience and understanding. And thank you again for connecting me with the patient navigator. I suppose that’s all for now. I look forward to hearing from the patient navigator. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m confident we can get this addressed effectively. I wish you a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. .
