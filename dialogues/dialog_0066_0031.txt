DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It’s been a bit bothersome, and I remembered the doctor back home said something about my heart… a funny beat, he called it. I think it’s called… atrial… something? I don’t recall the full name, but it’s what he connected to my leg feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and you recall your previous doctor mentioning something about your heart – atrial… something. That's helpful. Just to clarify, when did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a little puffiness around my ankle, really. But it’s gotten worse each day since then. Now it’s gone up my calf a bit. I noticed it more after I was on my feet for a long time, like when I was helping set up the new computers at the school.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, starting with the ankle and progressing up the calf, and it's worse after being on your feet for a long time. That gives me a better idea. Has there been any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. It's more… heavy. Like a dull ache, if I press on it hard, but not a sharp pain. And it feels… warm to the touch, if that makes sense? Not feverish, just… warmer than my other leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy feeling, warmer to the touch, and a dull ache with pressure. That's good information. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can recall, Doctor. I've been a bit tired lately, but I put that down to the long hours at the school getting everything ready for the new term. And I do get a little short of breath sometimes, but I thought that was just from walking up the hill to the school. Everything seems… normal otherwise, I suppose. I haven't felt any chest pains or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no chest pain, tiredness and shortness of breath that you attribute to exertion. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides what your doctor mentioned about your heart?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. I've always been quite healthy, to be honest. Just the usual childhood things, like chickenpox, but nothing serious. The heart thing was the first real… well, concern the doctor had. He didn’t say much about it, just told me to keep an eye on things. I suppose I should have followed up with it better, but things got busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other medical diagnoses. And the heart concern was something mentioned by a previous doctor, but you didn’t follow up on it. Do you know what kind of medications you're currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medications at all. Never have. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. That's why I haven't bothered with anything for the heart, even though I probably should have. I just hoped it would go away on its own. It's a bit silly, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, are you allergic to anything – foods, medications, insect stings, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve never had a reaction. I get stung by midges sometimes when I’m walking in the Highlands, but that’s just a bit of irritation, not an allergy. Nothing serious, thankfully. I don't have any known allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And just to finish up with the background information, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She was always a bit worried about it. And my grandfather on my father’s side… he had a bit of a bad heart as well, towards the end of his life. He was a very active man, though, always working on his croft, so it didn’t seem to bother him much until he got older. Other than that, I don’t recall any major illnesses in the family. They’re a sturdy bunch, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure in your mother and some heart issues in your grandfather. That's helpful. Alright, let's move on to a physical exam. Would you mind if I take a look at your legs and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Please do. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. It's just… I do get a bit nervous around doctors, if I’m being honest. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's take a look at your legs. Could you lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. There we are. Let me know if I need to adjust.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some definite swelling in your left calf compared to your right. The left calf measures 38 centimeters, while the right is 35. It's also slightly warmer to the touch. There’s no visible redness, and I don't feel any hard lumps. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Is that alright, Doctor? I sometimes struggle to breathe deeply, especially when I'm nervous. It’s a bit… shallow, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart rate is a bit fast – about 95 beats per minute. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, which could be what your previous doctor was referring to. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your left calf to check for any tenderness. This might be a little uncomfortable, but let me know if it's too painful.
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that's a bit tender, Doctor. Not terribly painful, but definitely uncomfortable. It feels… tight, as well. Like a pulled muscle, but… all over, not in one specific spot. And it feels a little bit… achy, even when you're not pressing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tightness, achiness, and tenderness throughout the calf. Okay, based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you may have a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, in your left leg. That's a blood clot in a deep vein. The swelling, warmth, pain, and irregular heart rhythm are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, we need to confirm it with an ultrasound. Do you have any health insurance?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a blood clot? That doesn’t sound good at all. No, Doctor, I’m afraid I don’t have any health insurance. I haven't been able to afford it, to be honest. What does that mean for the ultrasound? Will I be able to have one? I am worried about this, Doctor. A blood clot sounds very serious.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned; a DVT can be serious. And you’re right to ask about the ultrasound. Without insurance, it can be expensive. Let me see what options are available locally. There might be financial assistance programs or lower-cost imaging centers we can explore. In the meantime, we should assume this could be a DVT and take some precautions. I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test, which is a less expensive test that can help rule out a DVT, although it's not definitive. While we wait for the results, I want you to avoid prolonged standing or sitting, and elevate your left leg whenever possible. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. I can definitely avoid standing for long periods. And I can elevate my leg… I have a bit of a wobble to my chair, but I can put my feet up on it when I'm sitting. A D-dimer test sounds… better than nothing, I suppose. If it can help rule something out, that would be good. I am quite worried about this, Doctor. I really appreciate you trying to find a way to help me, even without insurance. Is there anything else I should be doing, or any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'll do everything I can to help. As for warning signs, you need to be on the lookout for any chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, or sudden dizziness or fainting. These could indicate a pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot that has traveled to your lungs. If you experience any of those symptoms, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'm also going to write you a prescription for compression stockings, which can help reduce swelling and prevent blood clots. They won’t solve the problem, but they can help manage the symptoms. And I'm going to give you a note for your school explaining your limitations and recommending you take frequent breaks. I'm ordering the D-dimer test now, and I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come back. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness… chest pain and shortness of breath? That sounds… frightening. I will definitely watch out for that, Doctor. Thank you for telling me. Compression stockings and a note for school sound… helpful, as well. It's kind of you to think of that. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. But I really appreciate your help, Doctor Condray. And thank you for not making me feel silly about not having insurance. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. And you shouldn't feel silly about anything. We'll take things one step at a time. I’m writing up the prescriptions and the note now. I'll also see if I can connect you with some local resources for financial assistance with healthcare. It's worth looking into. Just remember, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or coughing up blood, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, elevate your leg, wear the compression stockings, and try to get some rest. I’ll be in touch as soon as the D-dimer results are back. Do you have any trouble getting in touch with me if you have concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. You gave me a card with your number on it, and I’m quite good with my mobile phone. I can easily call you if I need to. And I will. I promise. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little bit better knowing that you’re helping me. I’ll go home and elevate my leg now, and try not to worry too much. It was lovely meeting you, Doctor Condray.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It was lovely meeting you too. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. I'll be in touch soon. And remember, elevate that leg. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
