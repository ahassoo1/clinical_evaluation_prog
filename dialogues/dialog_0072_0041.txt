DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… my legs. They’re getting weaker, you see. It’s been happening slow, over time. Not sudden, but… harder to walk these days. It worries my wife, and she thought I should come in.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness in the legs, developing gradually. And it's causing you concern, as well as your wife's. Can you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… heavy. Like trying to lift something very heavy, all the time. Especially when I first stand up. It gets a little better when I’m moving around, but then tires me out quicker. I used to be a strong man, you know. Work with the athletes, always on my feet. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: "Heavy," you say. And it's worse when you first stand, improves somewhat with activity, but then leads to fatigue. You mentioned working with athletes – is that what you’re still doing, or was that in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, that was… a long time ago now. I retired maybe fifteen years back. Used to be the trainer for the high school football team, then some college kids. Now I mostly just… help out around the house. Garden mostly. My wife does most of the heavy work these days. It makes me feel bad, not being able to do as much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're retired now, mostly gardening. And you're feeling frustrated with the decline in your ability to do physical tasks. Now, to get a better understanding of this weakness, let's go through a few more questions. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes. Sometimes. Mostly in my feet. Like… pins and needles. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. More often when I’m trying to sleep, I think. My wife says I sometimes move my legs around a lot in my sleep too. I don’t remember it myself, but she sees it.
DOCTOR: Pins and needles in your feet, particularly at night. And your wife has observed leg movements during sleep. That’s helpful information. Do you have any trouble with balance, Mr. Astore?
PATIENT: Yes. A little. Not enough to fall, not yet anyway. But I feel… unsteady sometimes. Like I might stumble. It’s worse when I turn my head quickly, or if I’m trying to walk on uneven ground. My wife holds my arm when we go for walks, just to be safe. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s good that your wife is so attentive. Feeling unsteady, especially with quick movements or uneven surfaces. We need to rule out several possibilities, Mr. Astore. Now, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not recently, no. I had a little cough last winter, but nothing serious. Just a regular cold, went away on its own. Before that… oh, it’s been a long time. I try to stay healthy, eat good food, get enough rest. I’m not one for getting sick, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me about ten years back. I take a little pill every day for it. Keeps it under control, he says. Diabetes… no, never been told that. Heart… nothing wrong with my heart, as far as I know. I had a check-up last year, everything was good.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, managed with medication. Good. And no history of diabetes or heart disease. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Years ago, when I was younger, I broke my arm playing football. Had surgery to fix it, but that was… sixty years ago maybe? Other than that… no. No other surgeries, no hospitals. Just the usual colds and sniffles, nothing serious enough for a hospital.
DOCTOR: Fractured arm as a young man, surgery to repair it. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she had… trouble walking when she got older. Not like me, not slow, but she stumbled a lot. Doctor said something about her nerves, I think. My father… he was strong all his life, never had any trouble walking. My sister, she's doing okay, as far as I know. Lives on the mainland, don’t see her much.
DOCTOR: Mother with some difficulty walking, possibly nerve-related. Father with no issues. Alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you currently taking any other medications besides your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the one for my blood pressure, the little white pill. And sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take some ibuprofen. Just when they really ache, you know? Not every day, just now and then. That’s all. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication daily, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks when I get a new prescription, just to be safe. But I've never told her, never told any doctor, that I was allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you for that information, Mr. Astore. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination to assess your strength, balance, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it gets uncomfortable, okay? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it slow and stop if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s just check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, if you’ll please stand up slowly… And let’s see how you do walking a few steps for me. Just a normal pace is fine.
PATIENT: It feels a little… awkward, Doctor. I don’t know if you can tell. Like I’m not lifting my feet all the way. And I feel a little wobbly.
DOCTOR: I do notice a slight shuffling gait, Mr. Astore, and a little hesitation with each step. And you are right, it appears you are not lifting your feet as high as you normally would. Now, let's try a quick balance test. If you’ll stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and try to close your eyes for about thirty seconds… I will be right here to steady you if needed.
PATIENT: Oh… whoa… I’m not very good at this, Doctor. I feel like I’m going to fall!
DOCTOR: Easy now, Mr. Astore. That’s alright. It’s good we tried it. You exhibited some instability and difficulty maintaining balance with your eyes closed. Now, let's check your reflexes in your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Ankle reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. And finally, I’m going to quickly assess the strength in your legs. If you can try to push your foot against my hand, like you’re trying to press the gas pedal in a car… Strength is 4/5 bilaterally. Meaning you have good strength, but not maximal.
PATIENT: It's a little harder than it used to be, Doctor. I’m getting tired. My legs feel… weak.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Mr. Astore, thank you for letting me perform that examination. Based on the physical exam and your medical history, the most likely explanation for your symptoms is peripheral neuropathy, likely related to age and potentially exacerbated by your history of high blood pressure. However, other causes need to be ruled out. To do that, I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, and glucose levels. I also recommend an electromyography study to assess the function of your nerves. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Neu-ro…pa-thy? What is that, exactly, Doctor? And EMG… that sounds complicated. Is it… painful? I don’t want anything painful. The blood work is fine, I don’t mind that. But what does all this mean?
DOCTOR: Peripheral neuropathy, Mr. Astore, simply means there's some damage to the nerves in your legs and feet. It's quite common as people get older, and can cause symptoms like weakness, numbness, tingling, and balance problems. Your blood pressure could contribute to this. As for the EMG study, it's a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles. It doesn't involve any needles going into the muscles, just small electrodes placed on the skin. It can help us pinpoint the exact location and extent of any nerve damage. It can feel a little uncomfortable, like a mild electrical stimulation, but it's generally not painful and only lasts a short amount of time. We'll do everything to make you comfortable. Essentially, these tests will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best treatment options for you, which may include medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Do you have any other questions about any of that?
PATIENT: So… damage to the nerves… and the tests will tell you how bad it is? And what if… what if it is bad? What kind of treatment are we talking about? Will I… will I end up in a wheelchair? My wife would worry so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astore, and it's perfectly natural to be worried. It's important to remember that most cases of peripheral neuropathy progress very slowly, and many people can manage their symptoms effectively with treatment. We're not at the point of discussing wheelchairs yet. That's a worst-case scenario we’re hoping to avoid. The tests will give us a clearer picture of the extent of the nerve damage, which will help us determine the best course of action. Treatment options may include medication to help relieve pain and improve nerve function, physical therapy to strengthen your legs and improve your balance, and lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption. In some cases, we may also recommend assistive devices, such as a cane or walker, to help you maintain your independence. We’ll take this one step at a time, Mr. Astore. First, we’ll get the test results. Then, we'll discuss your options in detail and develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you feel comfortable scheduling those tests today?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds… better. Yes, I suppose I can schedule the tests. But could my wife come with me? I think… I think I’ll need someone with me. She worries, but she also… she helps me remember things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Astore. Your wife is more than welcome to come with you to the tests, and I encourage her to be there. Having a support person is always a good idea, especially when you're going through medical evaluations. Let me see… We can schedule the EMG study for next week, on Tuesday at 10:00 AM. The blood work can be done anytime at our lab, just let them know you’re here for the tests Dr. Hembrey ordered. I’ll have the lab requisition and appointment slip ready for you. Here you go. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for letting my wife come with me. It… it makes me feel better, knowing she’ll be there. I appreciate your time, Doctor Hembrey.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if any questions arise before your appointments. We'll work through this together. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, Mr. Astore.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
