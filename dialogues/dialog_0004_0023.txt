DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, well, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but it does hurt. It’s like… a pain in my chest. Like… here.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say. It’s not like a sharp pain. More like… a sore feeling? Sometimes it feels full, like… too much pressure. And it's not just one spot, it’s… spread out a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when does this pain typically occur?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to say exactly. It doesn’t seem to be after I do something… like, working on the roof doesn’t make it worse, and resting doesn’t really make it better. It just… comes and goes. Maybe… more often at the end of the month? But I’m not sure. My wife, she notices it sometimes too.
DOCTOR: More often at the end of the month… that is an interesting observation. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Um… maybe six months? It started slow… just a little bit of discomfort. I didn’t think much of it at first, to be honest. I just figured it was something… I don’t know… muscle pain? But it’s been… more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you notice anything else accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Accompanying? Like… what do you mean? Like, does it happen with anything else? No… I don’t think so. No fever, no cough… nothing. Just the pain. Sometimes… maybe a little tired, but I work hard, Doctor. So I’m usually tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had this type of pain before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… new. My wife, she says I should come see someone, but… I don’t usually bother the doctor for things. I figure it will just go away.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good you're here now. Have you had any recent changes to your diet or activity level?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same as always. I eat… normal food. Rice, fish, sometimes chicken. Nothing fancy. And I'm always working on roofs, that hasn't changed. Hard work, every day.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My wife gives me medicine sometimes when I get a cold, but it always works fine. No problems. I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing. Just… what my wife gives me when I’m sick. Like, maybe Tylenol or something. But not all the time. I usually just rest, that’s what works best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a listen to your heart and lungs and do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing serious. My wife worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Good. Please lie back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths when I tell you to. Breathe deeply… and again… Now exhale. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower lobes. No wheezes or crackles, but definitely less airflow. I'm going to palpate your chest now. This might be a little uncomfortable. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a little sore. Like you said. It’s not a sharp pain. Maybe a little there… on the left side? It’s hard to say. It's just… sensitive. Not a big pain, though. My wife always tells me I need to stretch more.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is normal, and there are no murmurs. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Let’s check your pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation is 96%, which is acceptable. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I’m concerned about possible musculoskeletal pain, but the diminished breath sounds are troubling. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Is that… serious, Doctor? Is something wrong with my lungs? I haven't been coughing or anything. Just… this pain. My wife is going to worry so much.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Bulaong, but it's better to be cautious. Diminished breath sounds can indicate a number of things – fluid buildup, inflammation, or even something more concerning. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s a routine procedure. And I understand your wife will be concerned, but it's always best to rule things out. We need to investigate the cause of your symptoms. I’m also going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. So… you think it could be my lungs? Not just my muscles? Because I do a lot of heavy work on roofs, you know? Maybe I just pulled something? But… the breath sounds… that doesn’t sound good. What if it’s… something bad? My wife… she’s had a lot of trouble with her health lately. I don't want to worry her more.
DOCTOR: It could be musculoskeletal, and it’s certainly a possibility given your occupation. However, the diminished breath sounds are the reason I’m ordering the X-ray. It’s important to rule out anything more serious, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, or even a small pneumothorax – a collapsed lung. Those are less common, but we need to investigate. We won’t know for sure until we get the results. And frankly, speculating without the results would just cause unnecessary anxiety. We will get the tests done, review the findings, and then discuss a plan. I will write the orders for the X-ray, CBC, and BMP. The front desk will schedule the X-ray for you. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I guess not. Just… get the tests done. I want to know what’s going on. My wife… I need to tell her. She’ll want to come with me for the follow-up. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Bulaong. That’s understandable. I agree, it would be best for your wife to attend the follow-up appointment with you. The front desk will provide you with instructions on where to go for the X-ray. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, fever, or severe chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll see you both at the follow-up. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
