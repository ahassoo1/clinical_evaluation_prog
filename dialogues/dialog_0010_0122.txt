DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing…gaps. In my remembering. It is new, and it worries me, as my blood pressure has been…not good. I want to be clear, I remember everything else. Dates, names…but small things, recent things…they slip.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara, I understand. “Gaps” in your recent memory, and you’re concerned because of your blood pressure. That’s a very reasonable concern. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s been happening. When you say “recent things slip,” can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Yesterday, I made tea. Earl Grey, two sugars, as always. But…I could not recall putting the sugar in. I knew I did, I felt I did, but the act itself…gone. And this morning, I went to the market, purchased tomatoes, but I cannot remember which stall. I know I paid, I have the receipt, but…the interaction, the vendor…nothing. Small things, but…troubling.
DOCTOR: Alright, so very recent events – things you did do, you’re aware of doing – but the specific memory of performing those actions is missing. And this has started…when, roughly?
PATIENT: Approximately…three weeks, I believe. It started slowly. Misplacing keys, forgetting what I intended to say mid-sentence…things all people do. But it has…intensified. Now it is these…blanks. Three weeks, maybe a little longer. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly. My husband…he would have known. But…he is gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. Approximately three weeks, and it's been gradually worsening. And you’re right to be concerned with a change like this. Losing track of recent events can be unsettling. Before we proceed, let’s get a bit more background. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Only the…the high blood pressure. It has been managed, with medication, for some time. Though, lately, it has been…resistant to treatment, my doctor says. I take the pills, as prescribed, but the numbers…they do not come down as they should. No other conditions. I am otherwise…healthy, I believe. I have always been active. I manage many properties, you see. It requires much walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, and it's currently proving difficult to control with medication. That's important information. And you're generally active, managing properties. That's good. Now, let's talk about medications. Could you please list all the medications you're currently taking, including the dosages?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I have them listed here. Amlodipine, ten milligrams, once daily. Lisinopril, twenty milligrams, also once daily. And… Hydrochlorothiazide, twenty-five milligrams, once daily. That is all. I take them every morning, with breakfast. I am very careful about it. My husband…he was a pharmacist. He instilled in me the importance of precision.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 10mg, Lisinopril 20mg, and Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg, all once daily. Good, you’re very diligent about taking them. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I have eaten…all sorts of things. I travel frequently, and I am often trying new foods. No allergies. I am quite fortunate, in that regard.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Now, let's briefly touch on your family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: That is…difficult. My mother…she was always forgetful. But it was attributed to her temperament. She was…a bit scattered, always losing things. My father…he had heart problems, like myself. No…no clear instances of dementia or…serious memory issues. My siblings…they are all healthy, as far as I know. But we are not…close. We do not discuss such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, some familial forgetfulness, but no clear history of dementia. That’s helpful. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not drink alcohol. I find it…unpleasant. My husband…he occasionally enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner, but I never partook. And I have never smoked, nor have I ever used any recreational drugs. I have always led a…very clean life. I prefer tea, as you know. And quiet evenings at home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara, thank you for that detailed information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment – check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I want to understand what is happening. Please, proceed. I am ready. Though…I must confess, I do not like doctors. But I understand it is…important.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people feel that way. We'll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Alright, Ms. Alvara. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, as you know, 160 over 95. Your heart rate is slightly fast, but I don't detect anything immediately concerning in your lungs. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems good, but I did note some slight difficulty with your gait – a little unsteady. Given your recent memory problems and the difficulty controlling your blood pressure, I’m concerned about the possibility of vascular dementia or cognitive impairment related to hypertension. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need some further investigation. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. Additionally, I’d like to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI…that sounds…serious. But if you think it is necessary, then yes. Please, do whatever you deem fit. I want to know what is happening. I…I just want to understand. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid…and the MRI. Yes. Will it take long to receive the results? And…will it be painful? I do not like enclosed spaces.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Alvara. The MRI will give us a very detailed look at your brain, and it’s the best way to rule out other potential causes for your memory problems. The MRI itself isn’t painful. You’ll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will be quite noisy, but we can provide you with earplugs or headphones. It takes about 30-45 minutes. You are correct to mention the enclosed space – some people find it claustrophobic. If you're concerned about that, we can discuss options like a mild sedative or an open MRI, though the image quality may not be as clear with an open MRI. As for the results, the lab work should be back within a couple of days. The MRI will take a bit longer, maybe 3-5 business days, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once I have all the results, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a low dose of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It may help improve cognitive function. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor your response. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I said before, I have no allergies. Donepezil…that is a new medication for me. I trust your judgment. Low dose, you say? That sounds…reasonable. Three to five days for the MRI…I can manage that. I just…I want to be prepared. Will it require any special preparation? Fasting? Anything like that? And…what if the results are…bad? I understand you cannot predict the future, but…I am a widow, you see. I have no one.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious about the results, and I want to assure you that you're not alone. We'll face this together. The MRI doesn’t require any special preparation – you can eat and drink normally beforehand. And regarding the results, we’ll discuss everything thoroughly, and I’ll explain all your options. If the results are concerning, we'll explore treatment options and support services to help you manage your condition. I can also provide you with resources for local support groups and counseling. Before we finalize things, do you have a primary care physician I should forward the MRI results to?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I see Doctor Irina Volkov. She is…very good. Her number is 555-1234. She is located on Elm Street. She has been my doctor for many years. She will be able to explain everything more clearly, I am sure. And…thank you, Doctor. For being…patient. And for not dismissing my concerns. It is…difficult to explain these things.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I've got Dr. Volkov’s information here. I’ll forward the MRI results to her as soon as they’re available. Alright, Ms. Alvara, to summarize, we’ve ordered a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function test, and an MRI of the brain. I’m prescribing a low dose of donepezil. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once all the results are in. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have been very thorough. And…kind. I appreciate your time, and your patience. I will…await the results. And I will contact Doctor Volkov. Thank you again. I believe I have all the information I need for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
