DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… my skin. It’s darkening. And I’m terribly fatigued. It’s quite bothersome, really. I just want to know what’s causing it and how quickly we can fix it. I have commitments, you see. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue… that certainly warrants investigation. When did you first notice the skin changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, dates… they all blur together after a certain age. Some months ago, I suppose. It wasn’t sudden, more… gradual. Though I can’t pinpoint when exactly. It's just… more noticeable now. And the tiredness, well, that comes and goes, but it's been particularly persistent lately. Is that sufficient? I truly don’t have time for a detailed chronology.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll work with what you can remember. “Some months ago” is a good starting point. Has the darkening been all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Now you’re asking me to examine myself, Doctor? Really. It’s… everywhere, I believe. Perhaps a little more prominent on my hands and face. Though, truthfully, I don’t spend much time scrutinizing my own complexion. It’s a rather foolish exercise, wouldn’t you agree? I expect you to tell me, not the other way around.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. It's perfectly reasonable to expect me to do the examining. I just want to get a clearer picture. Would you mind if I take a quick look at your skin and do a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Must we? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. I’ve lived a long life, worked hard my entire time, and I’ve never been one to complain. But… if you insist. Just be quick about it, please. I have… matters to attend to. And please, be gentle. I’m not as resilient as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, I’m just listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Skin appears generally healthy, though I do note some diffuse hyperpigmentation, as you mentioned, particularly on the dorsal hands and face. No obvious lesions or masses. Your pulse is a little slow, around 60, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Do you have any history of liver problems, diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Liver problems? Diabetes? Thyroid… what even is that? Doctor, I’ve been a reinforcing iron and rebar worker my entire life. I build things. I don’t sit around worrying about… internal organs. My wife handles the medical matters. And she’s… particular about keeping such things to herself. I don't recall any significant illnesses. Just… the normal aches and pains of old age. I suspect this is all quite unnecessary. Is this leading somewhere, Doctor? Or are you simply trying to exhaust me?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Drahota. I’m not trying to exhaust you, I assure you. I'm simply trying to gather information to understand what might be causing your symptoms. The hyperpigmentation and fatigue can be caused by a number of things, and it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Given your history, and the fact that your wife manages your medical records, perhaps we could try a different approach?
PATIENT: A different approach? Finally. Yes, that would be preferable. Perhaps you could simply prescribe something for the fatigue. A tonic, perhaps? Something to… invigorate me. I have a very important project I need to oversee, and I can’t afford to be weak. I’ve always found a good strong tea to be quite effective. Do you have anything along those lines? And be quick, Doctor. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick solution, Mr. Drahota. However, prescribing something without knowing the underlying cause of your fatigue wouldn’t be responsible medical care. It’s important to understand why you're tired before we address the symptom. Given your fatigue and hyperpigmentation, and the difficulty in getting a clear medical history, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your liver function, blood sugar, thyroid levels, and look for any vitamin deficiencies. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, Doctor, the indignity of it all! Very well. If it will finally allow me to leave here, then so be it. But I expect a swift turnaround. I haven’t the patience for lengthy delays. And do tell me where I am to go to have these… tests performed. And make it a reputable facility, if you please. I will not tolerate incompetence. Now, can we be done?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I understand your frustration. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests. You can go to City General Hospital, their lab is very efficient. Here you are. They’re open from 7am to 6pm, Monday through Friday. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as jaundice, abdominal pain, or significant weight loss – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Just… expedite the process, if you would. And I trust you understand the importance of discretion. I have a reputation to uphold. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have commitments. Thank you for your… assistance. Though I remain skeptical of the entire endeavor. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I understand. I’ll make sure the lab receives the requisition promptly. And I assure you, all your information will be kept confidential. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
