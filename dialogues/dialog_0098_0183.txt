DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s… nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Grumman is fine. I am here because… well, I get tired. Very tired. Like, all the time. Not just after work, you understand. All the time. It is… annoying. My wife keeps telling me to come see someone. She worries too much, always. But, yes. Tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Grumman. Tired, all the time. I understand. And it's good you're here if it’s impacting your daily life. It is good to get things checked out. Now, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to say? I am tired. I sleep, I wake up, and I am… still tired. It is not like… a good tired after building something, you understand? It is… heavy. Like weights on my body. And it does not go away. I have had this… feeling for… a long time now, maybe six months? Longer. It is hard to remember exactly. It just… is. And the doctor said something about… my liver. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or longer... and a heavy feeling, not relieved by sleep. And you mentioned your doctor said something about your liver. Yes, that could be important. Let’s see… I’m pulling up your records now. Do you recall when and who you saw regarding your liver?
PATIENT: Dr. Alim, over by the market. Small place. He… poked and prodded. Said something about numbers not being right. I did not ask. Numbers are for… accountants. I told my wife, she… made a fuss. Then she made me drink some… nasty tea. Said it was good for my liver. I did not like the tea. It tasted like dirt. A long time ago, though. Before… the really bad tiredness.
DOCTOR: Right, Dr. Alim... I see a note here from about a year ago mentioning elevated liver enzymes. And… yes, I understand about the tea. It's good you’re telling me this, even if it wasn't a pleasant experience. Okay, let’s try to get a clearer picture of this tiredness. Aside from feeling tired, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind? I feel… normal. Except for the tired, of course. My stomach… sometimes feels… full. Even when I have not eaten much. And… I do not have much… appetite. But that could be the heat, yes? It is very hot these days. And sometimes… I get a little confused. Just… small things. Like… forgetting where I put my glasses. But I am an old man, Doctor. Old men forget things. Is that not normal?
DOCTOR: That's all helpful information, Mr. Grumman. Fullness even with little food, decreased appetite, and some forgetfulness… those are things we need to explore. And you’re right, some forgetfulness can be normal with age, but we want to make sure there isn’t anything else going on. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and maybe a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Poking and prodding again? Very well. But do not take too long. I have things to do. I need to… fix the fence. And my wife wants me to buy… flowers. Yes, flowers. She likes the pink ones. But quickly, Doctor. I do not want to spend the whole day here. Just… quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Grumman. I'll be as quick as possible. Alright, if you could just take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your abdomen. Just lie back, please. A little tenderness here, on your right side… not sharp, but noticeable. And your spleen feels… slightly enlarged. It's subtle, but I'm noting it. Now, let's just do a quick balance test. Could you stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Balance test? What for? Fine. I stood. See? Still standing. My wife says I wobble. But I am fine. Mostly. It is the floor, probably. Not level. Everything these days is not level. Can I sit down now? This is… tiring. All this standing and poking.
DOCTOR: You are right to point out how tiring this is, Mr. Grumman. And yes, you are a little unsteady, but nothing too concerning. Please, do sit down. Okay, Mr. Grumman. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I'd like to order some blood tests. We need to check your liver function again, as well as a complete blood count to see if there's any sign of infection or anemia. I also want to check your electrolytes and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking? Wonderful. What good will more poking do? But… fine. If you insist. But I want a bandage. A good bandage. Not one of those little strips that fall off immediately. And… quickly. I have things to do, you remember. Fence to fix, flowers to buy. This is all… very disruptive. Do I need to fast before this poking? My wife makes very good breakfast. I do not want to waste good food.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Grumman, a good bandage. Absolutely. And you do need to fast for the blood tests – about 8 to 12 hours. So, no breakfast tomorrow morning. I apologize for the inconvenience, but it’s important to get accurate results. The lab is just down the hall. They will explain everything to you. And… I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week? That is a long time to be… worried. But… fine. A week. As long as I do not have to fast for that as well. And make sure they have a good bandage. A very good bandage. Is that all? Can I go now? I really must get back to the fence. It is not going to fix itself, you know. And my wife… well, you do not want to know what happens if I do not bring the flowers. It is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Grumman. That’s all for today. And I've made a note about the bandage. We’ll make sure they have a good one for you. Here’s the form for the lab. Please take this to the lab technician. And… I’m writing down the follow-up appointment for you as well. One week from today, at the same time. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – severe abdominal pain, confusion, or anything that concerns you – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Get back to fixing that fence, Mr. Grumman. And… enjoy the flowers.
PATIENT: Hmph. Flowers. Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
