DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez, but please call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Chriselda. Thanks for seeing me. Um, it’s my bruising. It’s just… been getting worse lately, and I’m on that blood thinner stuff, you know? Warfarin, I think it's called. It’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that's getting worse while on warfarin is something we need to look into. Just to be clear, is it easy bruising, like with minimal contact?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday – just a little bump – and got a huge bruise. Normally, a bump like that wouldn't do anything. And it seems to be happening all over, not just where I actually hit something. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and that's definitely concerning. Okay, let's get some more details. How long have you been on warfarin, and what was it prescribed for?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… about six months now, maybe a little longer. Dr. Lawson put me on it after I had a blood clot in my leg. Deep vein thrombosis, he called it. Scary stuff. I was in the hospital for a week. It was awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months after a DVT. Good to know. And have you had any other bleeding issues since starting the warfarin?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really bleeding, bleeding. But my gums bleed a lot when I brush my teeth, more than they used to. And I get nosebleeds sometimes, which I didn’t used to get. Small ones, nothing major, but… more frequent, you know? I figured it was just the medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, gums bleeding and more frequent nosebleeds are also important to note. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Aside from the DVT, have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I broke my wrist once, but nothing else major. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Except for this, obviously.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mum had high blood pressure, and my uncle had diabetes. But no one else that I know of had any bleeding problems or anything like that. Everyone else is pretty healthy, as far as I know. It's not like it runs in the family or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work as an information security analyst, so I spend a lot of time at a computer. Not very active, I guess. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes. I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. And I definitely don't smoke. Does that help? I just want to get this sorted, if you know what I mean. I don’t want to end up back in the hospital.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. And no, you're not alone in wanting to get this sorted. Okay, last couple of quick questions. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin, I think. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Like, once a month maybe? I try not to take anything unless I really need it. I don’t really trust a lot of those pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Good to know. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and look at the bruising, and just generally do a quick assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have a meeting later, and I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, and your pulse is 78, regular. And I see quite a bit of bruising, as you mentioned, varying in size and color. There's some on both arms, and on your legs, and it does seem more widespread than I’d expect with just minor bumps. I don't see any active bleeding right now. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. Those sound clear. Given the bruising, the bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and the fact you’re on warfarin, we need to check your INR. Have you had your INR checked recently?
PATIENT: INR? Um… Dr. Lawson checks it every month or so, I think. I usually just go to the lab down the street. I had it checked last week, maybe ten days ago. I don’t remember the number exactly, but he said it was “good” at the time. He didn’t say anything about it being too high or too low. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, “good” from Dr. Lawson is helpful, but we need to confirm it ourselves. I'm going to order a blood test right now, including a complete blood count and a repeat INR. We'll also check your liver function. While we wait for the results, could you give me a list of everything you've eaten and drank in the last 24 hours?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Everything? Okay… Let me think. Yesterday morning I had toast and coffee. Lunch was a sandwich – ham and cheese on white bread. And dinner was fish and chips. I had a glass of wine with dinner. And I had a banana for a snack. Oh! And coffee, lots of coffee throughout the day. I don’t think I ate anything else. Does that help? It’s not very exciting, I know.
DOCTOR: It helps a lot, thank you. We're looking for anything that might interact with warfarin, or contribute to bleeding. Now, I know you mentioned being anxious about getting back to work, but I do want to be thorough. Could you tell me about any other symptoms you've noticed recently, even if they seem unrelated?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, more tired than usual. And I’ve had a few headaches, but like I said, I just took some ibuprofen. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit dizzy sometimes, but it only lasts for a few seconds. I just thought it was from working too much at the computer, you know? I really don't like feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, headaches, and dizziness are all things we need to consider. While we wait for the lab results, I want to rule out anything serious. Let’s briefly review your medications again. Just to be absolutely clear – the only medication you take regularly is the warfarin, and occasionally ibuprofen as needed?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Warfarin, and ibuprofen when I need it. And a multivitamin, but that’s it. Nothing else. I really try to stay away from pills, if you know what I mean. I get worried about side effects and stuff. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. I understand your concerns. While we wait for the lab results, I’m going to order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any internal bleeding, given the headaches and dizziness. I know it’s a bit of a big step, but it’s important to be thorough. It will also help us understand the cause of your bruising. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A CT scan?! Oh, boy. That sounds… serious. Is that really necessary? I mean, I just have a few bruises. And a headache. Is it definitely the warfarin? Could it be something else? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest. I really don’t like hospitals and scans and stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Courtnye. It is a bit of a big step, and I wouldn’t order it if I didn’t think it was important. Given the new symptoms – fatigue, dizziness, alongside the unexplained bruising and bleeding – and the fact you’re on a blood thinner, we need to rule out any internal bleeding as a precaution. It's better to be safe than sorry. It could be something else, but the combination of symptoms is concerning enough to warrant further investigation. The CT scan will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We will proceed cautiously. Are you comfortable with me ordering the CT scan, or would you prefer to discuss it further with Dr. Lawson before proceeding?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Okay. I… I guess if you think it’s necessary. But I really don’t like it. And I don’t want to wait for Dr. Lawson, I have that meeting later and… oh, this is just awful. Okay, fine. Do it. But please be quick, okay? And tell me everything as soon as you know something. I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Courtnye. I understand. I’ve ordered the CT scan, and I’ll let the radiology department know you’re on warfarin so they can take appropriate precautions. It shouldn't take too long, probably 30-45 minutes. I’ll have someone come and get you when they’re ready. In the meantime, I'm going to write a note for your meeting, explaining that you are undergoing medical testing. Do you want me to note anything specific?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be great, thank you. Just tell them I have a medical appointment and won’t be able to make it. And… maybe say I'm feeling unwell? I don't want to worry anyone. Thank you for doing that. I just hope this doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve written a note explaining you have a medical appointment and are feeling unwell. I’ll have it ready for you when you leave. I'm going to step out now to review your lab results as they come in. A nurse will be in shortly to take your vital signs and prepare you for the CT scan. Please don't hesitate to let the nurse or me know if you have any questions or concerns. And try to relax as much as possible. I will be back as soon as I have more information.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
