DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I am Dr. Mutnick. I see here you’re 51 years of age. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s rather…simple, really. I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens. I don’t have time for…complications. I'm not getting any younger, you know. Is that…possible?
DOCTOR: “Possible.” A rather broad term, Ms. Shteynberg. While conception is biologically possible, at your age, it does come with…increased considerations. We need to assess your overall health to determine the feasibility and potential risks. Now, let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Honestly, I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life. I mean, I had my tonsils out when I was a child – that was ages ago. And a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. I don’t go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to…manage things myself. Is this going to be a long list? Because I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: A luncheon. Right. While I commend your self-sufficiency, Ms. Shteynberg, attempting conception at your age without a proper assessment is…ill-advised. A complete medical history is essential. Now, regarding past illnesses, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I eat very well, thank you very much. Mostly organic. And I exercise – walk, mostly. Not one of those…gym people. High blood pressure? Good heavens, no. My mother lived to be ninety-two, perfectly healthy until the very end. It’s in the genes, you see. Auto…what was it? Sounds…complicated. I don’t do complicated.
DOCTOR: Autoimmune disorders are conditions where the body attacks itself, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s… never mind. Family history is relevant, certainly. Was your mother’s health uncomplicated throughout her life?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Perfectly. A bit of arthritis in her hands when she got older, but that's to be expected, isn't it? She had me quite late, actually – she was forty-three. And I was a perfectly healthy baby. See? It runs in the family. Is this going anywhere? I mean, are we going to talk about babies or just my mother's hands?
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Ms. Shteynberg. However, simply having a healthy mother is not a guarantee. We need to assess your current health status. Have you ever had any gynecological issues – irregular periods, painful cycles, or any surgeries related to your reproductive system?
PATIENT: Goodness. Really. Must we? Look, I've always been…regular. Perfectly so. And no, I haven’t had any…surgeries down there. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather…invasive. I’ve never had any problems. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not relive my entire gynecological history. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I assure you, these questions are necessary. I understand your…discomfort, but we must establish a baseline. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take some glucosamine. Nothing fancy. Honestly, I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. I don't trust those…pharmaceutical companies. Is that going to disqualify me from having a baby? It's just a vitamin, doctor!
DOCTOR: No, a multivitamin will not disqualify you, Ms. Shteynberg. However, we need a comprehensive understanding. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none. I’m perfectly…robust. I eat everything. Shellfish, peanuts, chocolate… everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. Really. I'm quite…sturdy, you see. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to list everything I don't have? I have a perfectly functioning body, doctor!
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. Since you insist you are in perfect health, a physical examination is in order. However, please understand that even with a perceived lack of issues, age introduces complexities. I will need to assess your vital signs, and then perform a pelvic exam to evaluate your reproductive organs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really? Must we go to such lengths? I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. But I trust you’ll be…gentle. And quick. I really do have that luncheon, you know. And please, don’t keep me waiting. I have a schedule, doctor. A very busy schedule. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Please disrobe from the waist down. I will return shortly. And Ms. Shteynberg, please be aware that this examination is vital to assessing your suitability for conception. Do not interrupt unless absolutely necessary.
