DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I am Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today seeking medical attention. To be efficient, could you please state the primary reason for your visit?
PATIENT: Morning. Yackey, eh? Sounds...foreign. I just moved here, that’s all. Needed to find a doctor, you know? Medicare says I have to come. Social thing, I think. Don't really need anything, honestly. Just...checking in, I guess. Old age.
DOCTOR: "Social thing," you say. Right. Well, Medicare does have its protocols. Though, generally, patients come when experiencing a specific ailment. Very well. To establish a baseline, and fulfill the necessary documentation, let’s proceed with a brief medical history. Perhaps you could tell me, have you experienced any changes in your health recently – anything at all, no matter how minor it may seem?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Everything hurts a little more, maybe? Is that a change? I do the theater, you know. Makeup. Lots of standing. Old bones. My back… sometimes it goes crack. Is that bad? I don't remember what the other doctor said. A long time ago, that was.
DOCTOR: “The theater,” you say. A physically demanding profession, I presume. “Crack” in your back… that could indicate a multitude of things, none of which are particularly comforting. And your recollection being… hazy… is not ideal. Let's attempt to create a comprehensive record. Have you had any prior serious illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh, goodness. Let me think. There was… a thing. A bad cough, maybe? A long time ago. In… Russia, I think. Or Poland? Something like that. They gave me pills. Lots of pills. Didn’t really help. And I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that doesn't count, does it? It was ages ago. I don’t remember the hospital much. Everything looked… white.
DOCTOR: A "thing" with pills… and a tonsillectomy. Vague, as expected. The lack of precise information is… frustrating. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Oh! I have this cream. For my face. Very good cream. French. Makes me look younger. And sometimes… sometimes I take something for my knees. When they really bother me. My friend, she gives it to me. I don't know what it's called. Little blue pill. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: A facial cream and an… unidentified blue pill. This is… suboptimal. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? I’m Russian! We don't have allergies. We drink vodka, it cures everything. Well… maybe I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish. But that’s it. A little itch. Nothing serious. I can handle it.
DOCTOR: "Vodka cures everything," right. And a minor shellfish allergy. Very well. To complete the preliminary assessment, I'll need to perform a basic physical examination. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Szmyd. Please lie back on the examination table. We’ll start with your vitals and a quick listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Examination table, eh? Must I? I'm a very important man, you know. Lots of people need my makeup skills. Can't be lying around all day. But… alright. Don’t poke too much.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. Pulse is a bit rapid. Lungs sound clear, but there is a slight… wheezing on expiration. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished. And finally, a quick abdominal palpation. There’s some tenderness in the lower quadrants. Not acute, but… present.
PATIENT: Tenderness? Oh, that. Yes, my stomach bothers me sometimes. It’s the food, I think. I eat… whatever is available. Not always the best, you know? And my blood pressure is high? I drink a lot of tea. Black tea. Very strong. Is that bad? This is all very alarming. I don't like doctors.
DOCTOR: "Whatever is available" and strong black tea. As for alarming, Mr. Szmyd, your blood pressure is elevated, and the tenderness warrants further investigation. However, given your… imprecise medical history and somewhat dismissive attitude towards preventative care, I suspect a definitive diagnosis will be challenging. I recommend a series of blood tests to rule out any underlying conditions and a consultation with a gastroenterologist regarding your abdominal discomfort. We should also schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your blood pressure. Would you be amenable to these suggestions?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Gastroenterologist? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? I really don't have time for all this. I have clients, you know! Very important people. Alright, alright. Do what you have to do. But make it quick. And no needles, if possible. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. I will order the necessary blood tests. The lab technician will collect the samples. As for the gastroenterologist, I will submit a referral. I will also provide you with a list of local specialists. Here is the lab requisition and the referral information. I suggest scheduling these appointments as soon as possible. If you experience any sudden or worsening abdominal pain, severe dizziness, or shortness of breath, please proceed to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Goodness, that sounds… serious. No, no questions. Just… tell me, will this affect my makeup appointments? I have a wedding next week. A very important wedding!
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I cannot guarantee whether these tests will interfere with your… appointments. It depends on the results and the recommendations of the specialists. I strongly advise prioritizing your health. A wedding can be rescheduled; a medical emergency cannot. I believe we have covered all pertinent matters for today. Please schedule the recommended appointments at your earliest convenience. And… try to rest. .
PATIENT: Rest? Easy for you to say. Fine, fine. I'll make some calls. But if I miss this wedding…
