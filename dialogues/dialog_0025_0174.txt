DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. Just… a bit down, you understand? It's been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: "Waste my time?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all! It’s just… I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I don’t like to dwell on things unnecessarily. And I know you’re a busy woman. I just want to be efficient, if you catch my meaning. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Efficiently down, then. Let's try to pinpoint exactly what "down" means for you, Ms. Derasmo. Can you describe how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's difficult to explain. Not exactly sad, not all the time. More… empty. Like the colour has gone out of things. And I haven't been sleeping well. Just… restless. It’s been affecting my appetite too, I suppose. I don't have much energy for my work anymore. It's… frustrating, really. A woman my age should be enjoying her retirement, not feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Empty, restless sleep, decreased appetite, low energy… Alright. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe six months ago? Around the time of my grandson's birthday, I believe. Though it's been gradually getting worse, not suddenly. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, you understand. Time seems to… blur these days. I haven't kept a strict calendar, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Six months… alright. And has anything specific happened in that timeframe?
PATIENT: Specific…? Well… my divorce was finalized about a year before that, but that was… difficult, of course, but I thought I was handling it. My daughter's been having some trouble with her marriage, but she doesn't like to talk about it. And… oh, there was that incident at the ski patrol lodge last winter. A young man had a bad fall… I was the first one there. Perhaps that's it. It shook me up more than I realized, maybe.
DOCTOR: A ski patrol lodge incident?
PATIENT: Yes. A young man… broke his leg, quite badly. I did what I could to help until the medics arrived, of course, but… seeing him like that, the pain… It just… stayed with me. I've seen accidents before, you understand, but this one was… different. A very bad break. He was so young. I keep replaying it in my head, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, you were a first responder at the scene. And this occurred six months ago, around the same time these feelings started?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Around the same time, yes. It wasn't immediately after, mind you. It was… gradual. But now, looking back, it seems… significant. It's just, I didn't think much of it at the time. I'm used to dealing with emergencies. I thought I was strong enough to just… carry on. Apparently, I was mistaken.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Derasmo, let's get a broader picture. Have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not like this, no. I've been sad, of course. Everyone has sad times. My husband… well, that was difficult, as I said. But this is… different. It’s not about a specific event, not really. It’s just… a pervasive feeling of… emptiness. And the lack of energy. I used to be so active! Skiing, swimming, gardening… now, I just don’t have the motivation. It's worrying, honestly. A woman needs her purpose, you understand.
DOCTOR: No prior history of similar episodes…Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… my mother was… a worrier, let's say that. Always anxious. My sister… she had a difficult time after her husband passed, very withdrawn for a long time. But no one, to my knowledge, was ever… formally diagnosed with anything, if that’s what you mean. Just… strong personalities, prone to… melancholy. It's not something we discussed much in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move on to medical history. Any significant medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was routine. I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, that’s why I don’t ski as much anymore. And… I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Other than that, I'm generally quite healthy, for my age. I take a multivitamin, of course. And I try to eat a balanced diet, though my appetite hasn’t been good lately, as I mentioned. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm not one for taking a lot of pills, you understand. Just the occasional pain reliever for my arthritis, and that's about it. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. Is this all taking too long? I wouldn't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, we're proceeding. Let's move on. What medications are you currently taking, even the occasional pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, right, yes. Just the ibuprofen for my knees, when they flare up. Usually about 200 milligrams, maybe twice a week. And I take a daily multivitamin, nothing fancy. That’s it, honestly. I’m not much of a patient, you see. I prefer to just get on with things. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Just routine. Then we'll discuss possible causes and next steps. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly acceptable. Routine is good. I understand the need for thoroughness, Doctor. Get it over with, as they say. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/85. Not bad, but a little elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Coordination is intact. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Neurological assessment is normal. Now, let's check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal, no nodules detected. Everything appears normal on physical exam. However, given your symptoms and history, I suspect… a case of adjustment disorder with features of depression. The ski lodge incident, combined with the divorce and your daughter's troubles… it's a lot to process.
PATIENT: Adjustment disorder… well. That sounds… complicated. Is that serious, Doctor? And what does that mean exactly? I just feel… off, you see. I don’t want a label, if you understand. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: "It means your emotional response is disproportionate to the stressor. It’s not uncommon, Ms. Derasmo, especially after significant life events. It’s not a definitive diagnosis yet, mind you. It requires further evaluation. But given your presentation, it’s the most likely explanation. We'll start with a simple questionnaire to assess your mood and anxiety levels, then proceed from there." "I'll have the nurse bring in the Beck Depression Inventory. It's just a series of questions. Be honest, alright?
PATIENT: A questionnaire… well. I suppose that’s alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I’m not fond of paperwork, you see. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been a practical woman. I deal with things. I don’t dwell on things. But if you think it’s necessary… then very well. Just hurry, if you wouldn’t mind. I have errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly, Ms. Derasmo. I'm ordering a complete blood count and a thyroid panel as well, just to rule out any underlying medical causes. It's standard procedure. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I'll review the results and the questionnaire and we'll discuss a plan of action at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Two weeks… Honestly, Doctor, that seems a very long time to wait. But… no. No, I don’t think so. I just… I suppose I just want to feel better. As soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll wait for the nurse. .
