DOCTOR: Right, hello. I'm Dr. Gorga. August 2nd… yes. So, Ms. Pitzel, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Gorga. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel… a bit stalled. Like I need a reset, or perhaps a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I’m not sure exactly where to begin, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A bit stalled… I understand. That's… fairly common, actually. Okay. Let's try to untangle things. When did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It’s not… sudden. More like a gradual thing, over the past year, maybe a year and a half? It started with just feeling more tired than usual, I suppose. And a little less… motivated. It’s hard to pinpoint a specific date, honestly.
DOCTOR: A year and a half… gradual onset. Tiredness, lack of motivation. Alright. And has this tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yes. But it definitely worsens some days. There are weeks where I feel… almost normal, and then it dips again. It seems to be tied to stress, I think. Work is… demanding, you see. I work with the molds, shaping things, casting… it's physical, and it requires a lot of concentration.
DOCTOR: Physical work, concentration… okay. Stress seems to be a factor. Now, aside from the tiredness and lack of motivation, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sleep hasn't been the best. I wake up several times during the night, even if I'm not particularly disturbed. And… my appetite has decreased. I don't crave much, and I've lost a little weight, though not intentionally. It's probably not a huge amount, but it's noticeable in my clothes.
DOCTOR: Okay, disrupted sleep, decreased appetite, some weight loss… Alright. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Well, yes, a little. I’ve been… more irregular, I suppose. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely different than it used to be. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It could be, yes. Just trying to get a complete picture. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or night sweats. And I said a little weight loss, not a large amount. It's more like my clothes fit a bit looser, you understand? Nothing dramatic. I don't think I'm sick sick, Doctor. Just… run down. And I'm hoping you can help me feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. No fever, no significant weight loss... You're feeling run down, tired, irregular sleep, appetite changes… I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just hop up on the table, and we’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look in your ears and throat. Let's begin.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Do let me know if I need to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Heart rate is regular at 72. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds normal. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Now, I’ll just take a look in your ears. Ears are clear as well. Everything seems normal so far, physically. Now, a little family history, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Of course. My mother… she had high blood pressure, similar to mine, I think. And she had some issues with her digestion as she got older. My father… he was generally very healthy, quite robust, actually. He passed away from a heart attack when I was still relatively young, in his early sixties. I don't have any siblings, so it was mostly just them.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother, heart attack in your father... Okay. And do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any significant reactions to anything, thankfully. I’m generally very careful about what I put in my body, both food and… other things. I’ve always been a bit cautious that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not. I prefer to avoid them if at all possible. I try to manage things through… diet and exercise, when I have the energy, of course. Which, lately, hasn’t been much.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. So, to recap… tired, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, some irregularity… mother with high blood pressure, father with early heart attack. No allergies, no current medications. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it could be a number of things. We could look into possible vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues… or it could simply be stress and burnout. I think it's best to start with some blood work. That will give us a better baseline. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good place to start. It would be good to rule things out, if possible. I agree, it's probably a combination of things, but understanding the physical side of it would be… reassuring. Yes, let's do the blood work.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. The nurse will draw those for you now. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, try to get some extra rest when you can, and focus on reducing stress if possible. Easier said than done, I know. But we'll get to the bottom of this. Any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. The nurse will let me know when she's ready for the blood work, correct? Thank you again. I feel a bit more hopeful already.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will come in shortly. And you're welcome. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Pitzel. We'll be in touch soon.
