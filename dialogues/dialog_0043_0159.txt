DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Elijiah. Uh, well, it's kinda weird to explain. I'm just...having trouble getting up from chairs. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's getting worse. Feels like my legs just...don't wanna work for a second or two when I stand up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah. It's perfectly alright to explain things as you feel comfortable. Trouble getting up from chairs, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like, I’ll be sitting, no problem, and then when I try to stand… whoa. It's not painful, exactly. Just… heavy. Like I gotta really push to get going. And sometimes, I feel a little unsteady for a bit after I do get up. It's kinda embarrassing, to be honest. Happens with most chairs, really. Even pretty sturdy ones.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're bringing this to my attention, and it's not uncommon to feel hesitant discussing these types of issues. Not painful, but heavy and requiring effort, with some instability afterwards… and it happens with most chairs. Approximately how long has this been going on, Elijiah?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six, seven months ago? At first it was just now and then, and I didn't really pay it much attention. Thought I just slept wrong or something. But it's been happening more and more lately. Like, a few times a week now, easy. Maybe more if I’ve been sitting for a long time.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months, gradually worsening, a few times a week now, more frequent with prolonged sitting. Thank you. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this, Elijiah?
PATIENT: Uh… not really, I don't think. My legs feel okay when I'm walkin’ around. No numbness or tingling. No pain, like I said. Just… that trouble gettin’ up. And maybe, just maybe, I feel a little weaker after it happens, for a little while. But I do pretty physical work, so it's hard to tell, you know? I'm usually tired anyway. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. No numbness, tingling, or pain, with possible transient weakness afterwards. And you rightly point out the difficulty in assessing weakness given your physically demanding work. Let’s delve a little deeper. Could you describe your work to me?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a roustabout in the oil fields. It’s… well, it's hard work. Lots of lifting, moving stuff around, bein’ on my feet all day. We do a lot of… rigging, and maintaining equipment, stuff like that. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Been doin’ it for about five years now. We're always movin' around, and sometimes workin' pretty long hours. It gets pretty physical, definitely. Mostly out in the field, not a lot of sittin’ when I’m actually workin’, but there's downtime, you know? When we're transportin' stuff or takin’ breaks.
DOCTOR: Five years as a roustabout… that certainly provides context. That level of physical activity is significant. Now, thinking beyond work, do you participate in any regular exercise or recreational activities?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Work kinda takes up all my energy, to be honest. I used to play a little soccer when I was younger, but haven’t done much of that in years. Mostly just… relaxin’ when I’m not workin’. Watchin' TV, spendin' time with friends. Nothin' too strenuous. I don't really have the time, or the energy, for a lot of exercise. It's kinda sad, I guess. I probably should be doin' more, but…
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Elijiah. Many people find it challenging to maintain a regular exercise routine, especially with demanding work. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, honestly. Didn't have a lot of money growing up, and…well, things always seemed okay. I had the usual childhood stuff - chickenpox, that kinda thing. But nothing serious. I don't take any regular medication, either. No prescriptions or anything. My wife… she always took care of all that stuff. It's been a little while since I've really thought about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Elijiah. That is helpful information. And I appreciate your honesty. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. And like I said, I haven’t really needed any. I’ve broken a bone or two when I was a kid, just little things. But nothing that required an operation. Nothing like… serious surgery. I've always been pretty lucky, I guess. Until this started happening, anyway.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, just minor childhood fractures. Very good. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom had… arthritis, I think. In her hands. She complained about it a lot when she got older. And my grandpa… he had some kinda heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a lot of details. My wife’s family… they were pretty healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses that I can recall. It's kinda hard to remember, to be honest. We didn’t really talk about medical stuff much. My wife's mom had diabetes, I think. But other than that… not really.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in your mother, potential heart trouble in your grandfather, and diabetes in your wife’s mother. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies, as far as I know. I eat pretty much anything. Never had any reactions to medication. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times when I've been sick, and never had any problems. No skin allergies, no food allergies… nothing. I always make fun of my friends who are allergic to stuff. I guess I'm just lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just wanna figure out what’s goin’ on and get this sorted out, if possible. I'm kinda tired of havin' to struggle to get up outta chairs, you know? So yeah, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’d please follow me to the examination table. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll assess your strength and reflexes in your legs, and check your range of motion. Finally, I will perform a neurological assessment to rule out any nerve compression. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. I'll just follow you. I'm a little nervous about all this, but I trust you. I've never really had a proper exam before, so… I'm kinda clueless about what to expect, but I'll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if somethin' feels weird or uncomfortable, okay? I don’t wanna cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. We’ll take things at your pace. First, if you could please lie back on the table, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Respiratory effort appears normal. Now, I'm going to check your strength and reflexes in your legs. If you could bend your knees and let your legs hang down, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Here you go. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m a little stiff, I gotta warn you. Spend a lot of time on my feet, you know? Not much time sittin' around. I'll just try to relax and let you do your thing. Is there anything I should be thinkin' about or anything? I'm kinda clueless about all this medical stuff, as I said before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally in all major muscle groups. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I lightly touch your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, 5 out of 5, that sounds good. I guess that means I’m not weak, right? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. I can feel stuff, no problem. Always been able to feel things. I’ll just let you know if somethin’ feels weird or if I can’t feel it. Just tap me wherever you need to, I guess. Hope it doesn't tickle too much!
DOCTOR: Sensation is intact to light touch bilaterally. Now, if you would please stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here we go. One, two, three… Yeah, I feel a little wobbly, to be honest. It’s kinda hard to walk straight when I haven’t been sittin’ for a while. My legs feel a little heavy, and I gotta focus to keep my balance. Hope I don’t fall or somethin’! How’s that look? Am I walkin’ like a drunk guy or somethin’?
DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah. You demonstrated a mild gait imbalance with a tendency to compensate. Your reflexes and strength are normal, and sensation is intact. Based on your history and the physical exam findings, I believe the most likely cause of your symptoms is a combination of factors, including prolonged sitting, which can lead to muscle deconditioning and reduced circulation, and potentially some mild weakness in your core muscles contributing to the instability. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious, but we should rule out other potential causes. Would you be open to getting some basic blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and inflammation?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. Muscle deconditioning… that makes sense, I guess. I do spend a lot of time on my feet, not much time sittin’ around. And my core muscles… I probably haven’t done a sit-up in ten years! Blood work… yeah, sure. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? Whatever it takes to figure out what’s goin’ on and get this sorted out. Just let me know what I need to do. I’m a little nervous about needles, to be honest, but I’ll try to be brave.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll just need a standard complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it should be relatively quick and painless. While we wait for the results, I recommend incorporating some core strengthening exercises into your routine and taking breaks to stretch and move around during prolonged sitting. I’m also going to prescribe a multivitamin with vitamin D to help address any potential deficiencies. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the prescription?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Core strengthening… I’ll have to look up some exercises on YouTube, I guess. And stretching… yeah, I can definitely try to remember to do that more often. YouTube, huh? I'm a little clueless about all this exercise stuff, to be honest. Maybe my wife’s cousin knows somethin’. She's a fitness instructor, I think. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Everything seems pretty clear. Just gotta get the blood work done and try to do some exercises, right? When should I expect the results to come back? And do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You've got the plan down perfectly. The results should be back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and assess your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, two weeks sounds good. Plenty of time to get the blood work done and try some of those exercises, I guess. Okay, so I just need to go get the blood work done whenever I have time, and then your nurse will call me when the results are back. And then I'll schedule an appointment for two weeks from now. Is there anything else I need to do or know right now? Or are we all set?
DOCTOR: You’ve got it perfectly. I’ll have my nurse provide you with the lab information when you’re ready to check out. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe weakness, numbness, or loss of balance, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Otherwise, I think we’re all set for today. It was a pleasure meeting you, Elijiah. I hope you have a good day and feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
