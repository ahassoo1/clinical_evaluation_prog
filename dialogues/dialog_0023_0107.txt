DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s racing, but not always. It’s hard to explain. It’s been happening for… a little while now. Maybe a month? I don’t keep good track of dates.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Funny” isn't a very precise term, Mr. Puder, but I understand it’s difficult to describe. Let’s try to be more specific. When you say "racing," can you estimate how fast?
PATIENT: Fast... like, really fast. Not like when I run up the stairs, but just… sitting. Faster than normal, for sure. Maybe… double speed? I don’t know speeds, really. It feels like it’s skipping beats too, sometimes. It makes me a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long does this “racing” typically last?
PATIENT: Not long. Maybe a few minutes. Sometimes it stops quick, sometimes it lasts longer. Like, maybe ten minutes once. It's not all the time, though. Some days I don’t feel it at all. It just… comes and goes. My wife, she worries, but I feel okay after. Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is also imprecise, Mr. Puder. Can you describe what you feel when it’s not “okay”?
PATIENT: Well... tired. A little bit weak, like I’ve been working too hard. And sometimes… a little bit short of breath, but not bad. Like I climbed a small hill. Not a big mountain, you know? It’s hard to explain. It's not… painful, never painful. Just… not right. My wife says I look pale sometimes too.
DOCTOR: And has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like... make it happen? I don’t think so. I’ve been trying to think. Sometimes after I eat… maybe? But I eat lots of different things. And sometimes when I’m stressed… work can be busy. But it happens even when I’m relaxing, watching TV with my wife. So, I don’t know if there’s a trigger, really. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: So, it appears to be fairly random. Let's move on to other potential contributing factors. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: High… what? No, no diabetes. Doctor, I work with chemicals all day, but I don't have problems! My wife always tells me to eat better, but I feel fine. Thyroid… I don’t know what that is. Never been told about that. I just feel my heart do funny things. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, "feeling your heart do funny things" is not a diagnosis. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a common condition, and it can contribute to these sensations. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that regulates your metabolism. It’s important to rule out potential underlying causes. Have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I cut my hand at work once, a long time ago, but it healed fine. No serious illnesses, no. Never been in the hospital. Just… this heart thing. I am a strong man, Doctor. I lift heavy things. I work hard. That's all. I don’t understand why my heart is doing this. Is it my chemicals? I worry about that, sometimes.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely your work is directly causing this, though we’ll note it. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes, but that’s it. She worries too much. I just want to know if my heart is going to break or something. Is that going to happen?
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, it is highly improbable your heart is simply going to “break.” However, these symptoms require investigation. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, sudden death, or arrhythmias in your family?
PATIENT: Arrhyth… what? My father... he had a weak heart, I think. He died when I was young. Old age, the doctors said. And my mother... she always complained about her chest, but I don’t know what was wrong. She died a long time ago too. No one else… I don’t think so. We don’t talk much about family history, you know? It's not something we do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. I drink… sometimes, a little beer with my wife on the weekend. Maybe one or two. And definitely no drugs. I work with dangerous chemicals all day, I don't need anything else. I promise. I am a good man, Doctor. I just want to fix my heart.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Puder. I’m going to perform a physical exam to assess your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll order some blood work and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to evaluate your heart's electrical activity. This will give us a better understanding of what's going on. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I trust you. I just want to know what’s wrong. My wife will be so happy we’re doing this. She worries so much. I will lie down now.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is currently 78 beats per minute and regular. I hear no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/85, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is regular and strong. I'm also noting some pallor, as your wife mentioned. I will now order the blood work and EKG. The lab results should be back in a few days. Until then, I advise you to limit caffeine and alcohol intake, and try to manage any stress.
PATIENT: Okay. No caffeine… that will be hard. I like my coffee. And stress… work is always stressful. But I will try. When will I know the results? And… what if it is something bad? My wife… she gets very upset.
DOCTOR: The results will be available in approximately three to five business days. My office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for “something bad,” Mr. Puder, it’s premature to speculate. We’re gathering information. However, should the results indicate a serious cardiac issue, we will discuss appropriate treatment options, which may include medication or referral to a cardiologist. It's important to remain calm and allow the testing to be completed first. Here is the requisition for your blood work. Please take this to the lab located at… Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… three to five days. I will try not to worry. My wife will be happy I’m getting it checked. But what does a cardiologist do? Is that… a heart doctor? I don’t want to see a specialist if I don’t need one. And... is this expensive? I don’t have insurance, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A cardiologist is a specialist who focuses specifically on the heart. They perform more advanced testing and provide specialized treatment for cardiac conditions. If the results of your blood work and EKG indicate a problem, a referral may be necessary. As for cost, I understand your concern. The blood work and EKG will likely be around… …approximately $200. A cardiologist consultation is typically more expensive, around $300 to $500. I can provide you with a list of local cardiologists and their contact information. We can also discuss potential payment options or financial assistance programs. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We will address all of this after we have the results. Here is the list. Please try to remain calm. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: $200… that's… a lot. I will have to ask my wife. She handles the money. Okay… a cardiologist… I hope I don’t need one. I really just want to know if I can keep working. I can’t afford to lose my job. My wife… she would be so worried. Okay. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time. I will go get the blood work done.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Puder. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with my office as soon as you have the results. We will discuss them and determine the best course of action. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Thank you. .
