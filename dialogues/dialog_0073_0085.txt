DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… this patch of skin. On my arm, mostly. It’s just… not right. It’s a funny colour, and frankly, I don’t understand why it’s changed. It’s been bothering me, and my husband insisted I come get it checked. He worries over everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, husbands often do. A "funny colour," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s…hard to explain. It’s not bad funny, exactly. More… unexpected. It’s sort of… a brownish-grey? Not like a bruise, and not like a tan. More… muted. And it wasn't there a few weeks ago, so naturally, I'm a bit concerned. It's on the inside of my left forearm. Perhaps you should look at it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look. Please, roll up your sleeve. I’ll need to examine it properly. Don’t worry, it’s likely nothing serious, but it's always best to be thorough.
PATIENT: There. Do you see it? It’s rather… subtle, isn’t it? I’ve been using the same hand cream for years, so it's not a reaction to anything new. I pride myself on a consistent routine, you know. It's important.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see it. A slightly hyperpigmented area, approximately 3 cm in diameter. No obvious scaling or inflammation. Palpable, but not raised. The texture seems…normal. And you say this appeared within the last few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, within the last few weeks. Perhaps a month, give or take. It wasn't there when I last had a proper look, and I do pay attention to these things. I do a full body check regularly, you know. It's part of my… preventative maintenance. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not prone to rashes or anything like that. It's just… unusual. It's not like anything I've ever seen before.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other skin changes anywhere else?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Absolutely not. I mentioned I do regular checks, didn't I? Everything else is perfectly normal. I keep myself well-covered when I'm gardening, you know. Proper sun protection is vital. This is…isolated. It's just this patch. It’s very frustrating, honestly. It’s ruining the overall aesthetic.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. No itching, no burning, no pain. It's… inert. That’s the oddest part, really. It doesn't feel like anything. Which, frankly, is more concerning than if it did feel like something. I mean, shouldn’t it do something if it’s changing? It's just… there. It's terribly illogical, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Let’s move on to your medical history then. Do you have any significant past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. A bit of low blood pressure, the doctor mentioned once, but nothing that requires any treatment. I eat a very balanced diet, mostly Ukrainian cuisine, you know. Very wholesome. And I exercise regularly - gardening counts, doesn’t it? I haven’t been seriously ill a day in my life, to be honest. My husband is the one who’s always at the doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just my tonsils, when I was a child. A very routine procedure, decades ago. Nothing else. No implants, no removals, nothing of the sort. I've always been rather careful about altering my… natural state, you know. It's important to maintain one's… integrity. Is that relevant, Doctor? It seems a bit excessive to be asking about childhood tonsils.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Bartock. We need a complete picture. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother had a touch of arthritis in her later years, nothing debilitating. My father was quite robust, lived to a good age. No history of skin cancer or anything particularly alarming, to be honest. Mostly just the usual things – heart problems, a bit of diabetes here and there. They were both very practical people, not prone to…fussing over their health. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m not sure what you’re looking for, specifically. It's not as if skin discoloration runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Heavens, no. I find the habit utterly repulsive. My husband used to smoke, briefly, in his youth, but he gave it up years ago. We both lead very…clean lifestyles. It’s important, you know, to maintain a certain…standard. It reflects on everything, really. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s hardly a vice.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m very careful about what I consume, you know. Fresh, organic produce whenever possible. I make my own preserves, in fact. It’s a very… controlled environment. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite a picture of health. This… discoloration is entirely out of character. It's unsettling, frankly. Are you thinking it could be something serious? You’re not seeing anything… worrisome, are you?
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I prefer to… address things naturally, when possible. A bit of chamomile tea for relaxation, perhaps, but that’s hardly a medication. I don’t believe in over-reliance on pharmaceuticals, you know. They just mask the symptoms, they don’t address the underlying issue. I maintain a very… holistic approach to my wellbeing. This is why this patch is so baffling. It's not a reaction to anything, it's not masking anything, it just… is. It's illogical!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I’ll need to check your lymph nodes, just to be thorough. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I hope this isn't going to be too invasive. I’ve never been comfortable with… unnecessary poking and prodding. But if it’s absolutely necessary, I suppose I can tolerate it. Just… be gentle, please. My skin is rather delicate, you know. And I've just had a manicure.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just checking for any swelling. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Normal range. Skin is warm to the touch. No tenderness. No induration. Hmm. The patch itself is flat, as we've established. No changes in texture beyond the pigmentation. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a standard precaution.
PATIENT: Very well. Honestly, Doctor, I do wish you'd explain what you're looking for. It's rather disconcerting to just lie here while being…examined, without any explanation. I understand you're a medical professional, but a little communication would be appreciated. Are you hearing anything… unusual? My heart has always been perfectly strong, you know. I walk everywhere.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds normal, Ms. Bartock. Now, let me have a look at your right arm, just to compare. As expected, no discoloration on this side. Skin appears normal. Alright. Based on what I’m seeing, it appears to be a localized hyperpigmentation. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing it without further investigation. We could do a skin biopsy to rule out anything serious, or we could simply monitor it for changes over time. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Heavens, no. Absolutely not. That sounds… invasive and unpleasant. And frankly, unnecessary. I've already told you, it's just a patch of colour. It's not raised, it doesn't hurt, it's not spreading. Surely, it can't be anything serious. I think monitoring it is the sensible option. If it changes, then we can revisit the idea of… poking and prodding. But for now, let's just… observe. I pride myself on being a pragmatic person, you know. Let's not create a fuss over nothing. How long should I… observe it for? And what exactly should I be looking for? I don't want to be needlessly worried.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll monitor it for four to six weeks. If you notice any changes in size, shape, color, or if it develops any itching, bleeding, or pain, then contact the office immediately. Otherwise, we can schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to reassess. I’m still inclined to suggest a biopsy eventually, but I understand your hesitation. Just be vigilant, Ms. Bartock. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… this is all rather unsettling. It’s not like me to have… imperfections. I always take such pride in my appearance, you know. And to have something… inexplicable… appearing on my arm… It's just… not right. Very well. Four to six weeks. I’ll… be vigilant. And if it hasn't faded by then, perhaps we can discuss a… less invasive form of investigation? A cream, perhaps? Something topical? But no poking and prodding, please. And Doctor, if it does start to bother me, can I just come straight to you? I don’t want to have to explain this all over again to another physician. It's terribly draining.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can schedule directly with my office. We'll see what the situation is in six weeks. For now, try not to worry, Ms. Bartock. It’s likely nothing serious. I’ll send a summary of our conversation to your EHR, and schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… addressing my concerns. And for not immediately suggesting a… drastic course of action. I suppose I’ll… be going now. I do appreciate your time, even if it was… somewhat unsettling. And please, remember my name. I don't want to have to repeat my entire medical history again in six weeks.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I have a note in your chart. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Honestly, the fuss over a patch of colour… It’s simply ridiculous. And I do wish she’d been a little more… reassuring. Six weeks. I suppose I’ll just have to wait and see. And try not to worry.
