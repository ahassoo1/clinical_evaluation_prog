DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor... Giganti, was it? Yes, yes. Well, I don’t really need anything, you understand. My daughter just thought... well, she worries. Says I should get “checked out.” Honestly, at my age, what’s the point? But here I am. Just… curiosity, I suppose. Though I’ve always been perfectly healthy, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Calvery. It's good of your daughter to encourage you to prioritize your health, and routine check-ups are a great way to stay on top of things, even if you're feeling well. We can certainly do that. To get started, could you tell me a little bit more about why your daughter suggested you come in?
PATIENT: Oh, she's always been a bit dramatic, that one. She said something about… my memory. Said I was forgetting things. Honestly, I forget what I had for breakfast sometimes, but who doesn’t? It’s just… age, I tell you. Nothing to fuss over. She made it sound like I was losing my mind or something. Really. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s very common to experience some memory changes as we get older, Mrs. Calvery. It's good that your daughter is observant, though, and wants to make sure everything is alright. Just to get a clearer picture, can you give me some examples of the things you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Examples… let me think. Well, just the other day, I went to the store for milk and… and what else did I need? I had a list, I know I did. But it just… vanished from my head. And sometimes I have trouble remembering the names of… well, people I haven't seen in a while. Not important people, mind you. Just… acquaintances. It's not like I can't remember my own children! Honestly, it's probably just stress. All this… change.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Forgetting things occasionally, especially with stress, is common. To get a more complete understanding, let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you noticed any other changes lately – anything at all, even if it doesn't seem related to your memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes. Let me see. Well, my knees have been a bit creaky lately, more so than usual. And I seem to get tired… quicker, I suppose. Used to be able to garden all day, now I need a nap after an hour. And… oh! My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to love a good meal, but now… everything just tastes a bit… bland. Not that I’m complaining, of course. It’s probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, those are all good things to mention, Mrs. Calvery. Knee pain, increased fatigue, and a decreased appetite are all common as we age, but it's good we're discussing them. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s a long story. Well, I haven’t been terribly sick, thankfully. I had the flu a couple of times, a bad cold here and there. And, oh yes, I had my gallbladder out… must be twenty years ago now? Everything went fine, I don’t remember the details. And… I think I had a bit of high blood pressure for a while, but they gave me a little pill for it and it went away. Really, I’ve been quite lucky. I don't go to doctors unless I have to, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mrs. Calvery. So, gallbladder removal twenty years ago and a history of high blood pressure that was managed with medication. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just that little pill for my blood pressure. But the doctor took me off it years ago, said I didn’t need it anymore. I take a Vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter. My daughter tells me I should. And… occasionally, I take something for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. It’s… I don’t even remember the name of it. Some sort of pain reliever. I get it at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Alright, so Vitamin D supplement and an as-needed pain reliever for your knees. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never really had a problem with allergies. I mean, I sneeze sometimes when the pollen is bad, but everyone does, don’t they? My daughter is very sensitive to cats, but I don't have any allergies myself. No, I can’t think of anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, too.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a sad story, really. My mother… she had dementia, later in life. It was… difficult. She didn’t even recognize me at the end. And my father, he had heart trouble. Passed away when I was quite young. My brother is still alive, thankfully, but he has diabetes. Really, not a very healthy bunch, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful information, Mrs. Calvery. A history of dementia, heart trouble, and diabetes. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… well, he smoked for a while, but I always made him go outside. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. And I certainly don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mrs. Calvery. Now, regarding physical activity, you mentioned gardening. About how often do you garden, and for how long each time?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I used to be able to garden all day. But these days, it's more like… an hour, maybe. When my knees are feeling good. Sometimes I take a walk around the block, but not very far. I mostly just sit and read these days, to be honest. It's easier on the body.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing that with me, Mrs. Calvery. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your reflexes and coordination. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. I don’t particularly like doctors poking and prodding, but I suppose it’s necessary. Just be gentle, alright? And try not to take too long. I have a book waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. I will be as gentle as possible and we’ll take things at your pace. If you could just sit here for me, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little slow, and coordination appears slightly diminished, but within normal limits for her age. Gait is slightly unsteady, with a tendency to shuffle. Everything seems within normal limits, although we will want to repeat some of these checks over time to monitor for any changes.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t so bad. Though I told you I was perfectly healthy, didn't I? A little unsteady on my feet… that's just old age creeping in. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine. Perhaps I should just go home and read my book?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Calvery, and I appreciate you sharing them. Even if you feel perfectly fine, these checks help us establish a baseline and monitor for any subtle changes over time. It’s like maintaining a car – regular check-ups can prevent bigger problems down the road. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and the slightly diminished reflexes and unsteady gait warrant further investigation. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, I would like to order some blood work and a cognitive assessment. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to the fatigue and memory concerns. The cognitive assessment is a simple test to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It's not a pass or fail, but it helps us get a better understanding of your cognitive function. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. But… my daughter would probably insist. She's always going on about preventative care. Fine. Do your tests. But I expect a clear explanation of everything. And no unnecessary poking and prodding, alright? And I want to know when I can expect the results. Don't leave me hanging.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. I promise a clear explanation of everything, and we’ll minimize any unnecessary discomfort. I'll order the blood work now; you can have it done at the lab just down the hall. They’ll need a sample from your arm. The cognitive assessment can be done here in the clinic, and it will take about 30 minutes. My nurse, Sarah, will schedule that for you before you leave. The results typically take about a week to come back. Once I have them, I will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your regular routine as much as possible. Try to stay active, even if it's just a short walk each day, and prioritize getting enough sleep. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes, that’s been a bit difficult lately. I wake up several times during the night. But I suppose that’s just getting old. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… don’t make a big deal out of it, alright? I don’t want to worry my daughter unnecessarily. And please, make sure Sarah is gentle with the blood draw. I hate needles. Alright, let’s get this over with. Where is this… Sarah?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Calvery. I’ll speak with Sarah and ensure she’s gentle and efficient with the blood draw. We’ll take things at your pace. I'll also note your difficulty sleeping so we can discuss it further when we review your results. Sarah, could you please come in for a moment?
