DOCTOR: Right, Lennie TKAC. 81 years young. Look, I'm quite busy today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. As the paperwork says, I'm here to get cleared for the Meadowbrook Senior Living Facility. They require a check-up before I can move in, you see. A formality, really, but a necessary one. I want to make sure everything is in order before making such a change.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the facilities always want that. Alright. So, you're generally feeling…okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, generally quite well, thank you. For my age, at least. I have my good days and my not-so-good days, as anyone does. The bones ache a bit more in the cold weather, and I get tired easier than I used to. But nothing that keeps me from my baking, mind you. I still make a mean sourdough.
DOCTOR: Baking, right. Okay. Any specific aches or pains currently bothering you?
PATIENT: Well, just this past week, my left hip has been giving me a bit of trouble. Not sharp pain, more of a dull ache that comes and goes. It seems to bother me more after I’ve been on my feet for a while, like when I'm kneading dough. But it eases up when I sit and rest. I haven't taken anything for it, really. Just tried to take it easy. Is that something I should be concerned about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Possibly. And how long has this been going on, this hip ache?
PATIENT: Let me see… it started, oh, about a week ago, like I said. Maybe a little longer. It wasn't bad at first, just a little stiffness. But it’s been getting more noticeable these past few days. I can still walk, mind you, and I haven’t fallen or anything. But it’s definitely…present.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other joints bothering you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the hip. My hands get a little stiff sometimes after a long day of baking, but that’s just from the work, I expect. Nothing that keeps me from my craft. My knees are alright, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky with my knees.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. No fever, no chills. I haven't lost any weight that I'm aware of – if anything, I've probably gained a little from all the sourdough I've been sampling! And I sleep soundly, thank goodness. No night sweats at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me get my bearings here. There we are. Take your time, please. I’m not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little tenderness on the left hip there, as you mentioned. Range of motion is…limited, but not severely. No obvious swelling or deformity. Can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Just a bit stiff, you see. It feels…tight, I suppose. Not painful, just uncomfortable. I try to keep a good pace, but it's not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knees feel stable. Ankles…some swelling, but nothing alarming. Okay. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I try to keep my breathing steady, even when I'm a little nervous. My father always said a good breath is the key to a long life.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds…a little murmur, but likely benign with your age. Lungs are clear. Okay. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Alright. We'll need to do some blood work to get a better picture. Just routine stuff. And perhaps an X-ray of your hip, just to rule anything out.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’d like to know what’s going on, of course, but I’m not overly worried. It’s probably just old age catching up with me. When would those be scheduled? And will that delay my application to Meadowbrook?
DOCTOR: We can get the blood work done right away in the lab down the hall. X-ray…they're usually pretty quick, let's see…we can schedule that for tomorrow morning. As for Meadowbrook, it might delay things slightly, but I can send a note to their medical records department explaining the situation. It shouldn’t be a major issue. Alright. We’ll get those orders sent now. And I'm going to prescribe you some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen – to help with the hip pain in the meantime. Use as directed.
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Blood work today, X-ray tomorrow, and a note to Meadowbrook. And ibuprofen. I appreciate your thoroughness. I suppose that’s all for now then? Is there anything else you need from me? I’d like to get going if I can, if you don’t mind. My sourdough starter needs tending to, you see.
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers it for now. Just try to rest your hip as much as possible and take the ibuprofen. I'll have the lab results sent to you and Meadowbrook as soon as they’re available. Here’s your prescription. And don't hesitate to call if things get worse. Alright, you’re free to go.
PATIENT: Thank you very much, Doctor Osga. I appreciate your time and your care. I will be sure to follow your instructions. I’ll let you get back to your busy day. And again, thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Goodbye.
