DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's… unpleasant. A bit embarrassing, really, to be discussing this. I have something… in my mouth. White patches. It’s been a few days now. It makes eating rather difficult. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this, so if we could be quick…
DOCTOR: Okay, Antoine, I understand it can be uncomfortable talking about these things, and I appreciate you coming in. We don't have to be quick, but I'll certainly do my best to be efficient. "White patches in your mouth" – can you tell me a little more about where exactly in your mouth you're noticing them?
PATIENT: Mostly on my tongue. And… the inside of my cheeks, a little. It's not… everywhere, thankfully. It just… appeared. I don't know what I did. I brush my teeth, you know. Regularly. It's just… bothersome. Is it contagious? My wife… well, she wouldn’t be pleased.
DOCTOR: Okay, on your tongue and the insides of your cheeks. And it came on suddenly. You brush regularly, that's good to hear. And you're understandably concerned about your wife – that’s very thoughtful of you. Let’s talk about that contagiousness question first. It could be something contagious, and it’s good you're thinking about that. But it could also be something else entirely. To help me figure it out, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the white patches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? It's white stuff in my mouth, Doctor. What other symptoms would there be? Perhaps… it's a little sore, sometimes. When I eat something acidic, like citrus fruits. Otherwise… no. I don't have a fever, if that's what you're getting at. I feel perfectly healthy otherwise. This is… a localized problem, I assure you.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask – sometimes it’s obvious, sometimes it’s not. A little soreness with acidic foods is helpful to know. No fever, that's good. Now, thinking about your overall health – have you had any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? No. I eat normally. Well, I’m eating less now, admittedly, because it’s unpleasant to chew with this… situation. But that’s the only change. I haven’t lost any weight. I don’t have time for… frivolous questions, Doctor. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine, and I apologize if my questions seem unrelated. I'm just trying to get a full picture. Eating less because of the discomfort is useful information. Okay. Now, have you ever noticed anything like this before?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never. I’ve always had perfectly healthy teeth and gums. This is… unprecedented. And frankly, quite worrying. I’ve never needed to come to a doctor for something like this before. It's probably nothing. Just a… temporary irritation. Perhaps from something I ate.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous episodes. And you suspect something you ate. That's a reasonable thought. Now, a couple more questions, and then I’d like to take a quick look inside your mouth, if that’s alright. Do you use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Tobacco? Really? Do I look like the sort of person who uses tobacco? Absolutely not. I find the habit… distasteful. And unhealthy, naturally. I maintain a… respectable lifestyle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Fair enough, Antoine. Just making sure. And do you regularly drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Socially, yes. A glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Nothing excessive, naturally. I’m not an… alcoholic, if that's what you’re implying. I assure you, my habits are quite moderate. Is this inspection going to be… unpleasant? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't be unpleasant at all. Just a quick look. I’m not implying anything, just gathering information. Alright, if you could open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Get it over with quickly, please. I really must be going. It’s… rather uncomfortable having someone looking in there. Just… do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Antoine. I see some white, slightly raised patches on your tongue and the inner cheeks, as you described. There’s a little redness in those areas as well. It doesn’t look severely inflamed, but it is noticeable. It looks like you may have what’s called oral thrush, or candidiasis. It’s caused by an overgrowth of a fungus, Candida. Often it occurs after taking antibiotics, or in people with weakened immune systems. However, it can happen for other reasons, too. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Candida? Fungus? I haven't been taking any antibiotics. And my immune system is… perfectly fine, thank you very much. I haven't been ill in years. This is… ridiculous. Is it contagious, Doctor? You mentioned something about that earlier. My wife… she's very particular about hygiene. I’d like to know if I need to… quarantine myself.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t taken any antibiotics recently. And it’s possible to get thrush even with a healthy immune system. It’s not always a sign of something serious. Regarding contagiousness: it’s somewhat contagious, but generally not easily spread through casual contact. It's more likely to spread through direct contact with the affected areas – like sharing utensils or kissing. Being mindful of that should be enough to minimize risk. To be certain and rule out other possibilities, I would like to take a swab of the affected area and send it to the lab for analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? More poking and prodding? Honestly, this is becoming quite a nuisance. I suppose… if you insist. But please, be quick about it. I really do have a meeting. And is there… medication for this? A cream or something? Something I can apply and be done with it? I don’t have time for lengthy treatments.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine, and I will be as quick as possible. A quick swab will give us a definite answer and ensure we're treating you appropriately. Yes, there is medication. Typically, thrush is treated with an antifungal mouthwash or a cream that you apply directly to the affected areas. It's usually very effective. We’d also want to discuss good oral hygiene practices. It’s a relatively simple treatment, and often resolves within a week or two. Let’s just take the swab first, and then we can discuss the specifics of treatment. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. Just get it over with. And please, be careful. I don’t want any… complications. This whole thing is quite… unsettling. I’ve never had to deal with something so… trivial. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done, Antoine. That was quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Yes. Over quickly. Now, how long before I get the results? And when can I expect… relief? I’ve a presentation to give this afternoon. I can’t afford to be… incapacitated. Is it going to be… noticeable? To my colleagues?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back to us. I'll have my assistant call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, to provide some relief and while we await the results, I’m going to prescribe an antifungal mouthwash called Nystatin. You’ll rinse your mouth with it twice a day after meals for seven days. It usually starts to improve symptoms within a day or two. It's unlikely to cause noticeable side effects, but some people experience mild nausea or stomach upset. Regarding your presentation: The mouthwash should help minimize any discomfort and make it less noticeable. However, if you're concerned, you could also try a salt water rinse beforehand to soothe any irritation. Do you have any questions about the mouthwash or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Nystatin… Salt water… Is that all? It seems… rather inadequate, considering the… discomfort. And the potential… embarrassment. Seven days? Will that be sufficient? I wouldn’t want this to linger, causing… disruption. Will I need a follow-up appointment? And how much will all of this cost? I have insurance, of course… well, not really. But I have funds. It’s the principle of the matter. This entire situation is… distasteful. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine. Seven days is usually sufficient for mild cases like yours. If it doesn't improve, we can re-evaluate and consider other options. Regarding cost: The mouthwash should be relatively inexpensive. We can discuss payment options if needed. As for a follow-up, let's schedule one for ten days from now just to ensure it's resolving as expected. That will give us peace of mind. I’m prescribing the Nystatin now, and my assistant will go over the instructions with you, as well as the payment process. I will also have her schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
