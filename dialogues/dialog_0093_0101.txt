DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, it's this headache I've been getting, right at the back of my head. It's been botherin' me for a little while now. Not constantly, mind you, but enough to make me want to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Aldine. A headache at the back of your head, coming and going. I understand. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the headache a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see... It's not a throbbing headache, more of a... a dull ache, really. Like a weight pressin' on the back of my skull. Sometimes it spreads a little to the sides, but mostly it's right there, at the base of my head. And it's not the kind that makes you wanna curl up and die, just… annoying. It comes and goes throughout the day. Mostly in the afternoons, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. A dull ache at the base of your skull, sometimes spreading to the sides, predominantly in the afternoons. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these headaches, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... bendin' over is bad. Like when I'm doin' a pedicure, you know, leanin' forward for a while. That seems to bring it on quicker. And if I'm tired, it's worse too. A long day at the salon and it's definitely hangin' around by evening. I don't think anything makes it better, really. Just restin', I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. So bending over and fatigue seem to exacerbate the headaches, and rest provides some relief. Do you experience any other symptoms with the headaches, Aldine?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when the headache's bad. Not a lot, just... a little swimmy, like when you stand up too fast. And I've been feelin' a bit more tired than usual, but that could just be my age, eh? I don't get nauseous or anything, and no sensitivity to light or sound. Just the ache and the blurry vision sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Aldine. The occasional blurry vision alongside the headache and increased fatigue is good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. Been watchin' what I eat and tryin' to stay active, walkin' when I can. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, you know? I haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. Mostly just deal with things as they come.
DOCTOR: I understand. A history of controlled blood pressure with diet and exercise is good to hear. And you haven't been regularly seeing a doctor recently. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, never. And thankfully, no hospital stays either. I broke my wrist when I was a little boy, climbin' a mango tree, but that's about it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to stay healthy, you know? Work keeps me busy, and I like bein' active. It's just this headache that's been botherin' me lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Aldine. No surgeries or hospitalizations, and a childhood wrist fracture. Now, concerning your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like headaches, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, like I said, but she lived to be 89, so it didn't bother her too much. My father, he had arthritis in his knees, that kept him slowin' down in his later years. And my sister, she gets migraines, bad ones, but I've never had anything like those. Just these dull aches, nothin' fancy. No one else I can really think of with headaches, though. Mostly just the usual old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aldine. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I'm married, been with my wife, Delores, for 62 years now. Bless her heart. We live in a little house just outside of town. I work as a manicurist and pedicurist, like you know, at a salon. Been doin' that for… oh, must be 50 years now! Keeps me busy, and I enjoy it. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly water, though. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables. And like I said, I try to stay active, walkin’ when I can. Not as much as I used to, but I get around alright.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aldine. That gives me a very good picture of your lifestyle. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most medications without trouble. Delores always checks when the doctor prescribes somethin', just to be safe, but I've never had an allergic reaction. I'm pretty lucky that way, too.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I don't take nothin' regularly. Sometimes I'll take a little something for aches and pains, like ibuprofen, but that's only when I really need it. Otherwise, I try to manage on my own. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit. Always good to get checked up, even if it's just to make sure everything's alright. I'll just sit here and do as you say.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination. Please relax your arms, and I’ll tap on your tendons. Alright, Aldine. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, and your coordination is slightly impaired. This could be due to a number of things. Now, I'm going to palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness or muscle tension. There's some tenderness at the base of your skull. Overall, the examination suggests possible tension headache, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Hmm, that doesn't sound too good, does it? Tension headache... I guess that makes sense, feelin' tense all the time leanin' over people's feet. But the blood pressure and… what was the other thing? The reflexes? That sounds a bit more serious. What do you think we should do about it, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're asking those questions, Aldine. It is important to address all of these findings. While the tension headache is likely contributing to your symptoms, the elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes do require further evaluation. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid function. We should also consider a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. Additionally, I’d like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week, twice a day, and keep a record of the readings. I want to be thorough and make sure we identify the cause of your symptoms. We need to determine if the blood pressure is consistently high and what might be causing the diminished reflexes. It's unlikely to be anything terribly serious, but it’s best to be cautious and investigate further. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Wow, that’s… a lot. Blood tests, a scan… it sounds expensive, Doctor. And a bit scary, to be honest. I haven't had a scan before. But I understand you want to be thorough, and I appreciate that. I don't know much about all these tests, to be honest. What exactly will the blood tests tell us? And what are we lookin' for with the scan? Is it gonna be painful? And… who’s gonna pay for all this? I'm on a fixed income, you know. Delores and I don’t have a lot of money to spare. I guess I'm just worried about the cost and what all this might mean. I just wanted somethin' for a headache, not… all this.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Aldine. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for that. Let me address your questions one by one. The blood tests will give us a comprehensive overview of your overall health. They can help us identify any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms, such as kidney problems, thyroid issues, or anemia. The CT scan will allow us to visualize the structures inside your head – the brain, blood vessels, and surrounding tissues. We’re looking for any abnormalities, such as tumors, bleeding, or structural issues that could be causing the diminished reflexes or headaches. The CT scan itself is not painful. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It’s a bit noisy, and you’ll need to remain very still during the scan, but it doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort. Now, regarding the cost, I understand your concerns. I will have my office staff check your insurance coverage, if any, and explore any financial assistance programs that might be available to help cover the costs. We can also discuss prioritizing the tests based on their importance and potential impact on your diagnosis and treatment. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to make this affordable and accessible for you. It's important to get a clear understanding of what's going on, and we'll work together to make that happen, regardless of the cost. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: That's... reassuring to hear, Doctor. About checkin' the insurance and the financial assistance. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly. We don't have insurance, to be honest. Delores had some medical bills a few years back and it used it all up. I guess I'm mostly worried about what the scan might find. If it's somethin' serious… I don't know if I'm strong enough to deal with that. I'm an old man, you know? But you're right, it's important to find out what's going on. So, yes, let's go ahead with the tests. Just... take it slow, eh? And let me know if it's gonna cost a lot before you do anything. I don't want any surprises. And maybe… maybe we can start with the blood tests first? That sounds a little less scary than a scan.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Aldine. I completely understand your concerns and anxieties. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about these tests, especially given your age and health history. We will take things at your pace, and I will keep you informed every step of the way. There will be no surprises, I promise. We will start with the blood tests first. They are less invasive and can provide valuable information about your overall health. Once we have the results, we can discuss them together and decide whether or not to proceed with the CT scan. And I will personally review the estimated costs with you before scheduling any further tests. I’ll write you a lab order for the blood tests. You can go to [Name of local lab], they have several locations. The order will include the necessary instructions. Once the results are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please continue monitoring your blood pressure at home, twice a day, and keep a record of the readings. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, dizziness, weakness, or vision changes, please contact my office immediately. Remember, Aldine, we’re in this together. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll do everything I can to provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any further questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very patient and explained everything so well. I appreciate it more than you know. I'll take the order and get the blood tests done as soon as I can. Delores will probably want to come with me, just to make sure I don't forget anything. Thank you again, Doctor Bakan. You've put my mind at ease a little. I'll see you when the results are back. And I'll try not to worry too much in the meantime.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aldine. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious, and you’re doing the right thing by getting things checked out. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And it’s a good idea to bring Delores with you. Having a support system is always helpful. Take care, Aldine, and I look forward to seeing you soon. Have a good day.
