DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings an… established gentleman such as yourself into the clinic today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor Paulino. Established, you say? That's one way to put it! Truth be told, it's this cholesterol business. Got a letter from the lab, said it was a bit high. Never really bothered me before, but figured I should get it checked out. Don't want any surprises, you know?
DOCTOR: A letter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter. A nice young woman sent it, after some blood work my daughter insisted on. She worries too much, that one. But, it said “hyperlipidemia” – I had to ask her what that meant! Something about too much fat in the blood, I think. Is that right? It just sounded…fancy.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia is a rather…clinical term, yes. Essentially, it means your cholesterol levels are elevated. Now, your daughter was… prudent to have you tested. While it’s not always cause for immediate alarm, it is something we need to investigate further. Do you have a copy of the lab results with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, she was very prudent. Almost bossy, if I'm being honest! And yes, I do. She made a whole folder for me, the girl. Here you go. I haven't looked at it myself, truthfully. Numbers just swim in front of my eyes these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Total cholesterol is 245, LDL is 160, HDL is 35, and triglycerides are 180. Not…ideal. And when was this blood work performed, precisely?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was just about two weeks ago, I reckon. July 18th, that’s right. She scheduled the whole thing, so I didn’t need to bother with dates. She does all the organizing. Is that…bad? Those numbers? Should I be worried, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Worry” is a strong word, Mr. Bohnett. Let’s say it warrants attention. An LDL of 160 is… elevated. Ideally, we’d like to see that below 100, particularly at your age. The HDL is a little low as well. Now, do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Below 100, you say? That sounds…difficult. Let me think… My father, he had a bit of a ticker problem towards the end. Not sure exactly what, but he was always a bit…breathless. And my mother, she had some sort of heart trouble, too, I think. But it was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about these things much back then. Just said she “wasn’t strong.” Does that help? I’m not much good with medical history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: “Wasn’t strong” is… unhelpful, medically speaking. Family history is relevant, however. So, a potential predisposition, then. Now, tell me, Mr. Bohnett, what is your typical diet like?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet? Well, I enjoy my food, Doctor. Always have. I like a good breakfast – eggs, bacon, toast. Sometimes pancakes if I'm feeling fancy. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe a little soup. And dinner… well, my daughter tries to send me healthy things, but I admit I sneak in a steak now and then. I do enjoy a good steak. And a little butter on my vegetables. Can't have vegetables without butter, you know.
DOCTOR: A…robust diet, shall we say. And do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity… Well, I used to. Played a bit of golf when I was younger. But my knees aren’t what they used to be. Mostly I get my exercise walking to the mailbox. And maybe a little gardening. Though my daughter does most of the heavy lifting these days. She says I need to take it easy. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, limited physical activity, a diet…higher in saturated fats. And we’ve established a family history of cardiac issues. I’m going to perform a brief physical exam now, Mr. Bohnett, just to assess your overall health. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An exam, yes. Sounds sensible. Lead the way, Doctor. These old bones don't move as quickly as they used to. Hopefully it won’t be too undignified for an established gentleman like myself.
DOCTOR: Please, Mr. Bohnett. It's a routine procedure. Murmur noted, grade 1/6. Lungs are clear to auscultation, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Soft, non-tender. Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Weight is 108 pounds. Rather underweight for your height, as well. Alright, Mr. Bohnett. That will be all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that wasn’t too bad. Though underweight, you say? I’ve always been a bit on the thin side. Never had much of an appetite. What does all this mean, Doctor? Are you going to give me a lecture about eating more steak?
DOCTOR: A lecture is hardly my intention, Mr. Bohnett. However, your current lifestyle is contributing to several risk factors. Based on your family history, physical exam findings, and lab results, I believe you have hyperlipidemia and are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The murmur I detected requires further investigation, as well. We need to rule out any underlying structural heart issues. I recommend an echocardiogram, and possibly a stress test. As for the cholesterol, we can start with lifestyle modifications – a healthier diet, increased physical activity – but given your levels and risk factors, I believe medication is also warranted. I’m thinking a statin would be appropriate. However, we’ll need to monitor your liver function closely. Does this make sense to you?
PATIENT: Echocardiogram…stress test…statin… That’s…a lot of big words, Doctor. And medication? At my age? I don’t know… I always thought a healthy diet and a little exercise was enough. What…what are the side effects of this statin? And what about this murmur? Is it…serious? My daughter will be terribly worried. I’m not sure I understand all of this.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, Mr. Bohnett. Statins, like all medications, have potential side effects. The most common are muscle aches and, rarely, liver abnormalities. That’s why we monitor your liver function with regular blood tests. As for the murmur, it could be benign – many people have harmless heart murmurs – but it warrants further investigation to rule out any underlying structural heart problems. An echocardiogram will allow us to visualize your heart and assess its function. I understand your daughter will be concerned, and it’s prudent to involve her in these decisions. We can schedule these tests with the cardiology department, and I’ll provide you with detailed information about each procedure. The goal here is to mitigate your risk and ensure your long-term health. I can write a referral to a cardiologist for an echocardiogram and stress test. We will also schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. Does this sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Acceptable… I suppose so. It’s not what I wanted to hear, but… I trust your judgment, Doctor. A referral to a cardiologist, you say? And a follow-up appointment in one month? Yes, alright. Do that. And… could you possibly write down the names of these tests? And maybe a little explanation? For my daughter. She likes to read things herself. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bohnett. Here you are. It includes a brief explanation of the echocardiogram and stress test, along with the cardiologist’s contact information. I’ll also schedule your follow-up appointment for one month from today, August 2nd, at 10:00 AM. In the meantime, I recommend you continue with a healthy diet and moderate physical activity, as tolerated. And please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: August 2nd…yes, that works. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think that’s all for now. You’ve given me a lot to think about. And to discuss with my daughter. Thank you again for your time, Doctor Paulino. I appreciate your patience. I suppose I’ll see you next month. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Bohnett.
