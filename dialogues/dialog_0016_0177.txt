DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Courtnee Maskal, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Hi, Doctor. It's... something down there. It's... leaking. I don’t know what it is, but it’s not good. It’s been happenin’ for... a little while now. Not a lot, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, “something down there” and “leaking.” I understand it's been going on for a little while, and enough to bother you. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More? Well, it's... it's kinda slimy, you know? And... smelly. Not a good smell. I try to keep things clean, but... it just happens. I don't know why it happens. It's not like I've been... doing anything different. I'm a respectable woman.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Jimmi. It sounds understandably concerning. “Slimy” and “smelly” gives me a little more to work with. To help me figure out what’s going on, could you tell me where exactly you’re noticing this happening?
PATIENT: Down there, like I said! On... on the man part. It’s… where a man part should be. I don’t know the proper names, Doctor. I’m an artist, not a… a body parts expert. It’s just… coming from in there. It’s embarrassing to talk about, honestly.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be embarrassed, Jimmi, and you don’t need to know medical terms. You're doing the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. So, it’s coming from the vaginal area. Has this happened before, or is this a new issue?
PATIENT: Vaginal... yeah, that's what they call it. I always thought it was just… woman parts. New, mostly. I mean, I've had… things, you know? When I was younger. But nothin’ like this. This is… different. It's not a regular thing, never been regular. Just… pops up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, “pops up sometimes,” and different from anything you’ve experienced before. And you said it wasn't regular, even when you were younger. Can you tell me about how much leakage you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, not a whole lot, Doctor. Not like a flood, or anything. Just... a little dampness. When I go to the bathroom, sometimes. And sometimes it smells real bad, even after I wash. It’s not constant, that’s for sure. More like… a few drops, here and there. Enough to make me change my underwear, that’s all.
DOCTOR: “A few drops, here and there, enough to make you change your underwear.” Okay, that’s helpful. Now, has there been any pain, burning, or itching associated with this?
PATIENT: Burning? No. It doesn’t burn. It’s just… unpleasant. And itchy? Sometimes. Not real bad, but… yeah, a little bit of itchiness. Mostly just… uncomfortable. Like somethin's not right. I don’t like it. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, “uncomfortable” and “nervous” – I understand. No burning, sometimes a little itching. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urination—frequency, urgency, or difficulty?
PATIENT: Urination? Let me think... No, not really. I go to the bathroom when I need to, same as always. Doesn’t hurt, doesn’t… rush me, or anything. No different. I drink a lot of water, you know? Gotta stay hydrated. I don’t think I’ve noticed anythin’ different with the pee part.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in urination. Now, I’m going to ask some more general questions, if that's alright. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I'm always a little warm, living in this heat, but not a fever fever. Chills? No. And… night sweats? I sleep with a fan, Doctor. Always have. It gets hot. So I sweat a little, but not like… sick sweats. Just regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or unusual night sweats. Now, have you noticed any unusual vaginal odor other than the smell you mentioned with the leakage?
PATIENT: Uusual? Hmm. Well, sometimes it smells… fishy. Not always, but when it’s real bad. That’s when I know somethin's really wrong. It’s not a nice smell, at all. Like somethin's… rotten.
DOCTOR: Okay, a "fishy" smell at times, like something rotten. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if that's okay. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history... I’m an old woman, Doctor! I’ve had the usual aches and pains, you know? Arthritis, mostly. Hurts when it rains. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but I don't take nothin’ for it. No diabetes, never been told that. And… autoimmune? What’s that? I just try to stay active, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and occasionally high blood pressure. No diabetes, and you're not aware of any autoimmune conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries... Let me think... I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long time ago! And… oh, I had a hysterectomy when I was in my 40s. That was… a while back. Other than that, nothin'. I try to avoid the doctors, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a hysterectomy in your 40s. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I can't think of anythin' I'm allergic to. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use cheap soap, but that's it. I don't take much medicine, so I haven't had much chance to be allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you’re not currently taking any medications. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And she had arthritis, too. And… well, my sister had… somethin’ with her stomach. Cancer, I think. A long time ago. Other than that, nothin' I can really think of. We weren't a family that talked much about our health.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had high blood pressure and arthritis, and your sister had stomach cancer. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink, never have. And… recreational drugs? What would I do with those? I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I just like to paint. That's my pleasure.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jimmi. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve me listening to your heart and lungs, and then doing a pelvic exam to take a closer look at what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a pelvic exam? Oh, dear. That sounds… uncomfortable. I haven’t had one of those in years. Is it… necessary? I mean, can’t you just give me somethin’ for it? A cream, or somethin'? I don't like people lookin' down there.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jimmi. It's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable with that. A pelvic exam will help me to see exactly what's going on and determine the cause of the leakage and odor. It’s the best way to make sure we get you the right treatment. I'll be as gentle and quick as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go. We can stop at any time if you're feeling too uncomfortable. Sometimes a cream can help, but without knowing the cause, it might not be effective. It's important to rule out anything serious. Would you like me to explain the exam process in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose so. If it's really necessary. But you have to be very gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And tell me what you’re doin’ every step of the way. I don’t like surprises. What exactly is involved? I mean, what are you gonna do?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I promise to be very gentle and explain everything as I go. First, you’ll lie on your back on the exam table with your knees bent and your feet flat. I’ll drape you with a sheet to keep you covered as much as possible. I'll start by looking at the external area, just to check for any visible signs of irritation or infection. Then, I’ll gently insert a speculum, a slightly curved instrument, into your vagina to allow me to see the cervix, the opening to your uterus. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll also do a gentle internal exam with one or two fingers to check the size and shape of your uterus and surrounding structures. I'll collect a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis, which will help determine the cause of the infection. The whole exam usually takes just a few minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It sounds… awful. Speculum? That sounds… scary. And fingers? Oh, goodness. But… I suppose I have to, if you say so. Just… be quick. And gentle, like you promised. And tell me what you’re doin’ before you do it. Don’t just… poke and prod. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I promise. I’ll explain every step before I do it, and I’ll go as slowly as you need me to. We can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Okay, let’s get you comfortable on the exam table. I’m going to help you lie back and position yourself. Then I’ll bring in the drape and explain the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Just… be careful. And gentle. I'm an old woman, Doctor. My parts aren't what they used to be. Go slow. Very slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, you’re doing great. I’m going to start by just looking at the external area. I’m just checking for any redness, swelling, or irritation. This won’t be uncomfortable at all. I’m not seeing any obvious signs of irritation or infection externally. Now, I’m going to gently insert the speculum. I’m going to warn you, you may feel some pressure, but try to relax your muscles as much as possible. This will help it be more comfortable. I’m going to tell you when I’m inserting it… ready?
PATIENT: Ready… I think. But… go slow. And tell me exactly what you're doin'. Don't just… rush it. Oh, goodness. This is awful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jimmi. I’m gently opening the speculum now… just a little at a time. You may feel some pressure… …and there… that’s it. Just taking a look now. I’m seeing some discharge, as you described. It's slightly yellowish and has a somewhat fishy odor. I’m going to gently collect a sample now with a swab. This will just feel like a quick swipe. …Alright, that’s done. Now, I'm just going to do a quick internal exam with one finger to feel the size and shape of your uterus. …Just feeling… and that's it. Okay, all done. I'm going to gently remove the speculum now. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. That was… not pleasant. It felt… cold. And a little pokey. But… it’s over, right? Is that all? I just want to go home now. I hope you find out what’s wrong. This is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Yes, Jimmi, that’s all. You did great. I know it wasn't comfortable, and I appreciate you coming in and letting me examine you. I’m going to send the sample to the lab for analysis, and it should take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to suspect a bacterial vaginosis, which is a common infection. It's easily treated with antibiotics. I'll need to prescribe you some medication now. It's a gel you apply internally for a week. I'll also give you some instructions on how to use it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? A gel? Oh, goodness. More pokin’ and proddin’? I don’t like the sound of that. Is it… painful? And what if it doesn’t work? I just want this to go away. I'm too old for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jimmi. The gel is very easy to use. It comes in an applicator, and you simply insert it into your vagina once a day for a week. It shouldn’t be painful at all, maybe just a slight sensation of pressure. It's very effective in treating bacterial vaginosis, and it usually clears up the infection within a few days. If it doesn't work, we can try a different medication or investigate further. We'll cross that bridge if we come to it. I'm going to write you a prescription now, and I'll also give you some written instructions. Are you able to pick up prescriptions easily?
PATIENT: I… I get my daughter to pick things up for me. I don't drive anymore. She works at the grocery store, so she can usually manage it. She's a good girl. Just… make sure the instructions are clear. I don’t want to mess it up. And… how much will it cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good, having someone to help you out. I’ll make sure the instructions are very clear and easy to follow. And I can call in a prescription to a pharmacy that offers a discount program if you’d like, to help with the cost. Do you have a preferred pharmacy?
PATIENT: A discount program? That would be… good. Yes, please. I usually go to the one inside the grocery store, the one my daughter works at. It's… CVS, I think. Yes, CVS. That would be very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, CVS it is. I'm calling in the prescription now and requesting the discount program be applied. Okay, it's been sent to CVS. Your daughter should be able to pick it up within a few hours. I’m also going to give you this handout with information about bacterial vaginosis and how to prevent it. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient, and… not judging me. It was embarrassing coming here, but you made it… easier. I hope this medicine works. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jimmi. I’m glad I could help. It's completely understandable to feel embarrassed, but you did the right thing by coming in. And I'm confident this medicine will help you feel better soon. If you don't feel any improvement after a few days, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's my card with the office number. Get some rest, and I hope you have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I'm going to go home and… lie down. And maybe take a nap. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Jimmi. Take care. .
