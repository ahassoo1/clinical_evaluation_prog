DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it's these bumps on my legs. They're on my shins, and they really hurt. Been bothering me for a little while now. They're kinda red and...hard, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are red and hard, and causing you pain. "A little while now" – can you give me a rough estimate of how long they've been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Maybe...two, three months now? It started with just one, and I didn't think much of it. Then more kept showing up. It's not getting worse quickly, but it's definitely not going away. It kinda just...is. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, starting with one bump about two to three months ago, and gradually more have appeared. And it hasn't been rapidly getting worse, just persistent. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to make them better or worse?
PATIENT: That's right. Persistent is a good word for it. Hmm...make it better or worse... I don't think so, not really. Maybe when I'm resting they don't bother me as much. But I work a lot on my feet, you know, moving stuff around. So, they get pretty sore at the end of the day. I haven't noticed anything helping them, though. Tried some lotion, but didn’t do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they're more bothersome with activity and improve with rest, and lotion hasn't provided relief. Good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, heart trouble, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, uh...well, I have Medicare, so I see the doctor pretty regular. Let me think... Doc says my blood pressure's a little high sometimes, but he gives me a pill for it. Other than that...not really. I used to have problems with my back when I was younger, from lifting heavy things, but that’s mostly okay now. Nothing else I can think of, really. Do you need to know more?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, which is managed with medication. And a past history of back problems. I appreciate you letting me know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Uh...let me see. Just the one for my blood pressure, I think. Sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really acting up, but not every day. It’s just an over-the-counter thing, like ibuprofen. Oh! And sometimes a little something for sleep, but that’s only when I can’t really get to sleep. It’s a small dose, my wife gets it for me. She's good at keeping track of things, I'm not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication regularly, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a small dose of something for sleep occasionally. Your wife sounds like a great help! Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife asks me every time I get a new prescription, just in case, but I always tell her no. I eat pretty much anything, too. I like Filipino food, of course! And...well, I don't go around touching a lot of things that would give me an allergy, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Alright, let's move on to your past medical history a little further. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. Oh! When I was a young man, back in the Philippines, I had my appendix taken out. That was a long time ago. And...I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but I don’t remember much about it. Other than that, nothing. No surgeries that I know of. Everything else is just bumps and bruises from work, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and tonsillectomy in the past. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother, she had diabetes, I think. And my father...he had heart trouble, I remember him being sick with that. My wife's side, her mother had high blood pressure too. Lots of aches and pains in the family, you know? Everyone works hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and high blood pressure. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what you do for work?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I work at the warehouse down the street. I move freight, you know? Boxes, pallets, all sorts of things. It’s a lot of lifting and standing, and walking around. Been doing it for…oh, a long time. A little hard on the body, but it pays the bills. My wife worries about it, but I try to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, warehouse work involving lifting and standing. That gives me a better understanding. Now, one last thing before I take a look at your legs. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife doesn't like it, and it's bad for you, you know? I used to drink a little beer sometimes, with my friends, but not anymore. Doc told me to stop, it messes with my blood pressure. So, I stick to water now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and you've stopped drinking alcohol. That's all very helpful information, Mr. Aluia. Thank you for being so thorough. Alright, let's take a look at those bumps on your shins. Could you please point them out to me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doc. Here, see? Right here, on my shin. And there's one here, and a couple more down here. They're kinda hard, and they hurt when I touch them. Especially this one.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see them. They are firm, red papules, mostly located on your anterior shins. There's some slight tenderness to the touch. I don't see any signs of open sores or infection at this time. Based on what you've told me, and what I'm seeing, it's possible these are shin splints, or more specifically, chronic exertional compartment syndrome. But to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work to check your inflammatory markers and rule out any underlying systemic conditions. Also, an X-ray of your shins to make sure nothing else is going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray, huh? Okay, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get these things figured out. They're really bothering me, and I don't want them to get worse. Are these things…serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're proactive about getting them checked out. Usually, shin splints aren’t serious, but it’s important to rule out other conditions. The blood work and X-ray will help us do that. The blood work will look for inflammation or other signs of a problem, and the X-ray will make sure there are no stress fractures or other bone issues. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, I recommend rest as much as possible, ice packs to the affected areas for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the discomfort. And we can discuss proper footwear and stretching exercises to help prevent this from happening again. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Rest, ice, and pain relievers…okay, I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear I’m finally taking it easy! Stretching exercises sound good too, I probably don’t stretch enough. And…what about the footwear? Do you want me to bring in the boots I wear to work?
DOCTOR: That’s a great idea. Bringing in your work boots would be very helpful. We can assess the support and cushioning they provide. Improper footwear can definitely contribute to shin splints. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the X-ray for you. She’ll give you instructions on fasting requirements, if any. We should have the results back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse, or you develop any signs of infection – like fever, redness, swelling, or pus – please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doc. You explained it all very well. Just rest, ice, boots, and blood work…and I’ll see you when the results are back. Thank you very much for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
