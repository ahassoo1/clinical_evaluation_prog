DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pipkorn. The pleasure is all mine. I’ve been experiencing a rather peculiar sensation in my back. It’s… well, it’s a popping, or clicking, sound and feeling. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: A popping or clicking sensation in your back, you say. And for how long has this been occurring, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, approximately three months ago. It wasn’t constant at first, just occasionally when I was… well, when I was working on the trains, mostly. Now it seems to happen more frequently, even when I’m not at work. It’s a bit concerning, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Working on the trains?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m an electrical and electronics installer and repairer—specifically, for transportation equipment. Mostly trains, although sometimes buses. It involves quite a bit of bending, reaching, and… well, maneuvering in tight spaces. I suspect that may have something to do with it, but I’m certainly no expert.
DOCTOR: I see. And can you describe the sensation more precisely?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to explain perfectly. It’s not painful, not exactly. More of a… a distinct feeling of something catching, and then releasing with a pop or click. It usually happens when I rotate my back, or bend over to pick something up. Sometimes it feels like it’s right in the middle of my back, other times it’s a bit to the side. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a mild discomfort immediately after the pop. It doesn’t radiate, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: No, that’s quite helpful, thank you. So, no radiating pain, and the discomfort is immediate, not prolonged. Does anything relieve the sensation, or make it worse besides bending and rotating?
PATIENT: Well, resting seems to help, naturally. If I lie down for a while, it usually subsides. And honestly, a warm shower does wonders. As for making it worse… lifting anything heavy definitely exacerbates it. And prolonged sitting, especially in a less-than-ideal chair, doesn't do it any favors. I find myself shifting positions quite a bit throughout the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this—any numbness, tingling, weakness in your legs or feet, or any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that at all. No numbness, tingling, weakness… everything feels perfectly normal in that regard. Bowel and bladder function are unchanged, thankfully. It really is just this popping and clicking sensation, and the mild discomfort that follows. I was hoping it would resolve on its own, but it hasn’t, and I didn’t want to risk making it worse.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you had any previous back problems or injuries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve always considered myself quite fortunate in that regard. No significant injuries, no surgeries, no chronic pain… I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises, of course, working with electrical equipment, but nothing that would affect my back. I’ve always been fairly active, and I try to maintain good posture. I can’t say I’ve ever pulled a muscle or had a sprain in my back. Perhaps a little stiffness from time to time, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: And what about any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have slightly elevated blood pressure, which my primary care physician is monitoring. I take a low dose medication for it, which seems to keep it under control. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. No diabetes, no heart problems, no allergies… I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’m a relatively healthy 40-year-old, if I may say so myself. I try to eat a balanced diet, and I don’t smoke or drink excessively. My wife would certainly attest to that.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the medication for blood pressure, as I mentioned. No over-the-counter medications regularly, no vitamins, no supplements… nothing like that. I generally prefer to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I try to address things through diet and exercise whenever possible. I am a believer in preventative measures, if you will.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me about any family history of back problems or other musculoskeletal issues?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… my father did have some lower back pain in his later years, but he was a very physically demanding job for decades. Construction work, mostly. I always assumed it was just wear and tear from the job. My mother had some arthritis, but it wasn’t specifically in her back. As far as I know, no other significant musculoskeletal issues in the family. It’s not something we discussed frequently, to be honest. My family isn't one to dwell on medical issues. I do recall my aunt had some issues with her hips, but that was unrelated, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Mastrantonio, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination of your back. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, and I am happy to cooperate in any way I can to determine the cause of this sensation.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would please lie face down on the examination table. I will start by palpating your spine to assess for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort as I press on these areas. I'm not detecting any obvious muscle spasms at this time. Now, I’m going to assess your range of motion. I will ask you to gently bend forward, backward, and rotate your torso. Please stop if you experience any pain.
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt, Doctor. Just a bit of pressure, nothing alarming. That feels… normal, I suppose. Okay, bending forward… That’s a bit stiff, but not painful. It feels… like a normal stiffness, the kind I get after sitting for a long time. Bending backward… Similar sensation, Doctor. A bit of stiffness, but nothing acute. Rotating now… There it is, Doctor. That little pop… not painful, just a sensation. I feel it on the right side, mostly. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s quite helpful, Mr. Mastrantonio. I do detect a slight crepitus—that’s the clicking or popping sound—on the right side of your lumbar spine as you rotate. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but not significantly so. Neurologically, your reflexes and sensation are intact in your lower extremities. No signs of radiculopathy at this time. I'm also assessing for any pain with percussion. This may be a bit uncomfortable, so please let me know if it becomes too much. Do you feel any pain when I tap here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t hurt. Just the tapping, nothing alarming. It’s… a bit of a strange sensation, but not painful. I can feel it, of course, but it’s not causing me any discomfort. It's similar to when I get tapped during a physical, I suppose. Not an issue at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on my examination, it appears you likely have what we refer to as spinal crepitus, possibly with some mild facet joint dysfunction on the right side. This means there's some clicking or popping in your spine, which can be caused by small bubbles of gas in the joint fluid, or by minor irregularities in the joint surfaces. The limited range of motion and the crepitus suggest some slight inflammation or stiffness in the facet joints, which are the small joints on the back of your spine. It's important to note this is a common finding, and often doesn't require extensive treatment. However, since you're experiencing discomfort, we should discuss some potential options. Are you currently experiencing any radiating pain down your legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, as I mentioned earlier, absolutely no radiating pain. It's strictly localized to my back, and as you say, just a discomfort rather than actual pain. It hasn't interfered with my daily activities significantly, but it is concerning enough for me to seek it out and get it checked. And you said it’s common? That’s… reassuring, to be honest. What sort of options are we looking at, then? Would physical therapy be helpful, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's quite common, particularly as we age. Physical therapy is an excellent option, and I would recommend it. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding your spine, improve your flexibility, and restore proper joint mechanics. They can also provide modalities such as heat or ultrasound to reduce inflammation and pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can also be helpful for reducing inflammation and discomfort, as needed. I also recommend maintaining good posture and avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms. I'd also like to order a lumbar X-ray to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. It’s a precautionary measure, but I feel it's prudent given your discomfort. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Physical therapy definitely appeals to me, and I’m happy to try that. I try to maintain good posture, as I said, but perhaps some professional guidance would be beneficial. And the X-ray… yes, absolutely. If it provides peace of mind and rules out anything serious, then I’m all for it. I'd prefer to be proactive, rather than reactive. When would we schedule those?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will write a referral for physical therapy, and the prescription for the X-ray. The X-ray can be completed at the imaging center across the street; they have same-day appointments usually. I will have my nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the X-ray and assess your progress with physical therapy. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly—for example, if you develop radiating pain, weakness, or numbness in your legs, or if you experience any changes in your bowel or bladder function—please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all perfectly clear. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. The nurse scheduling the follow-up and providing the X-ray information is fantastic. Thank you for taking the time to listen and address my concerns. I appreciate it very much. I believe that covers everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. It was my pleasure. My nurse will be in shortly to finalize the paperwork and schedule your appointments. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
