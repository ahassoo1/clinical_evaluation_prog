DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s this breathing. It’s been bothering me, and I thought it best to get it checked. I have trouble when I lie flat. It feels…tight. I don’t know how else to explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing that’s worse when lying flat… that’s good information. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started… oh, goodness. Perhaps… three months ago? Maybe a little longer. It wasn't sudden, you see. It just… gradually got worse. At first, I just needed an extra pillow. Now… well, now it’s quite uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over three months. And it’s progressed to where an extra pillow isn’t enough anymore. Do you notice anything else that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Well… exertion, certainly. Walking up hills, carrying things… anything like that. And sometimes, if it’s very humid… it feels harder. Though, I suppose that’s just common sense, isn’t it? A bit of a warm day and everything feels more difficult. I don't know if that's related though.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Exertion and humidity seem to play a role. Do you experience any coughing along with the breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little sometimes, in the mornings, but just a tickle in my throat. Nothing… forceful. Just enough to clear my throat, really. It's not a productive cough, if that makes sense. Nothing comes up.
DOCTOR: Okay, no productive cough, just a mild tickle in the mornings. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… yes, actually. A little. Just at the end of the day, mostly. I thought it was just from being on my feet too long at the library. I’m a library assistant, you know. Lots of shelving and helping folks. But… perhaps it is related? I hadn't connected the two, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your ankles at the end of the day. That could be related. And to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I had my gallbladder removed… goodness, almost twenty years ago now. And I have…well, I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years. I see Dr. Abernathy for that. And…arthritis, in my hands. It flares up sometimes. Other than that… no, I think that’s it. I've been fairly healthy for my age, I like to think.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, well-controlled hypertension, and arthritis in your hands. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down here somewhere. Ah, here we are. Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And I take it every morning with my breakfast. I haven't missed a dose in years, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Good. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've taken antibiotics and… well, all sorts of things over the years. Nothing untoward. I always tell Dr. Abernathy if something doesn't agree with me, and she keeps very good notes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me think. My mother had… heart trouble, I believe. She passed away when she was 78. And my father had diabetes. He lived to be 85, though, so I suppose he managed it well enough. My brother… he’s still alive, thankfully, but he has high cholesterol. That’s about all I can recall, to be honest. It wasn’t something we talked about much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I suppose it’s to be expected. The sooner we figure it out, the better. Please, go ahead. I’ll just sit here quietly. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated. Your heart sounds are… slightly diminished, and I hear some crackles in the bases of both lungs. And as I suspected, there is some mild swelling in your ankles. Crackles in the lungs and the ankle swelling are concerning. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better picture of what’s going on. I also want to check your blood levels, including a complete blood count and a BNP to assess your heart function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… rather a lot. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Please, do whatever you need to do. I just want to feel better. What does all that mean, though? Are my lungs… bad? And what’s a BNP? I don’t understand all these medical terms. Is it serious? I suppose I should ask, shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Vanderwiele. I want to assure you, we're gathering information to understand what's causing your breathing difficulties. The chest X-ray will help us look at your lungs and heart to see if there's any congestion or other issues. The EKG checks the electrical activity of your heart. And a BNP is a blood test that helps us assess if your heart is under strain. The crackles I heard in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles suggest there may be some fluid buildup, which could be related to heart failure, but we need the tests to confirm that. It doesn't necessarily mean you have heart failure, but it's important to rule it out. We’re taking precautions and gathering information. We will discuss the results as soon as they are available. It is important to note that fluid in the lungs can be caused by many things, not just the heart. I don't want to alarm you, but it's better to be thorough. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Fluid in the lungs… not necessarily the heart… that’s…reassuring, somewhat. My mother did have heart trouble, though, so it’s a worry. But you’re right, it’s better to be thorough. What do I do now? Do I go somewhere else for the tests? Or do you do them here? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a book club meeting on Thursday, and I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: We can do all the tests right here in the clinic, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for the BNP and schedule you for a chest X-ray. The X-ray should only take a few minutes, and the blood work will be sent to the lab. Typically, the results come back within 24-48 hours, so we should have them by Thursday at the latest. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Doctor. Here in the clinic, results in 24-48 hours, call you when they’re back, and emergency room if things get worse. I’ve written it all down. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve put my mind at ease somewhat. I appreciate that. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any restrictions? Or… should I avoid salt? My sister always says too much salt is bad for your heart. Is that true?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. As for restrictions, I wouldn’t recommend any major changes to your diet or activity level right now, until we have the test results. Your sister is right – limiting salt intake is generally good for your heart health, but we'll discuss specific dietary recommendations if the results indicate a need for them. For now, just focus on monitoring your symptoms. If you notice any increased shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or swelling in your legs or ankles, please call the office immediately. I think that’s all for now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your patience. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will check in with you after the tests are completed. Please don't hesitate to call the office if anything changes.
