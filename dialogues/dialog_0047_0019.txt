DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Manuel. Um... my wife and I... we want a baby. She says I need to come here, for... making sure everything is okay? I forget what she called it. It's about... starting a family. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Right. Yes, I understand. Your wife is concerned about your fertility. Well, at your age, Manuel, it is prudent to have a look at things. Though frankly, I find it rather...uncommon. But, we’ll proceed. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing…conditions? Hmm. I had a bad cough once, many years ago. And my back, it sometimes aches. Old age, you know? But…nothing the doctor ever really did anything for. I take a little pill for my water, the one for my…pressure, I think? But that’s all. I don't remember anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what is this “little pill” for your “water”?
PATIENT: It's... a white one. Small. My wife gives it to me every morning with my tea. She says it's for my…blood. Too much, she thinks. It makes me…tired sometimes, if I don't eat. I don't really know the name. She handles all that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Let me see… ah. You’re taking amlodipine, 10 milligrams daily, for hypertension. And, according to the records, you were diagnosed with high blood pressure approximately five years ago. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Five years... maybe. It all feels like a long time ago. Yes, I think so. The doctor did say something about my blood, yes. And told me to watch the salt. My wife is very good at that. She cooks very healthy food. I mostly just... take the pill. I don't worry too much about it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Manuel, it's good your wife is on top of things. However, it is important you understand your medications. Now, have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries...? Let me think... I had my teeth out, a long time ago. When I was a young man. And…I think I had something on my leg, a small thing. A doctor cut it out. But that was…many, many years ago. When I first came to this country. I don’t remember much about either one, to be honest. Everything gets blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family... hmm. My father, he was a strong man, lived a long life. But he had…problems with his stomach, I think. And my mother, she had a weak heart, I remember. She passed away when I was young. I don’t know what happened with my brothers and sisters, really. We didn’t see them much. It was a long time ago. Things were different then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Manuel, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoked. My wife… she wouldn’t allow it. Bad for the health, she says. Always has been. I like my tea, that’s all. And sometimes, a little sweet biscuit. But no smoking. Never.
DOCTOR: And alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…? Not much. A small glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. On special occasions. My wife and I, we don't really drink much. We prefer tea. And talking. We like to talk. It’s better for us, she says.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Manuel, before we proceed further, have you ever had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. I don’t think so. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s just the sun, I think. Nothing serious. My wife gives me cream for it. No… I don’t think I have any allergies. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Manuel. Given your age, and the fact you are hoping to start a family, we need to do a basic physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick examination of… well, everything. It’s standard procedure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. My wife said I should listen to everything you say. So… go ahead. I hope it won't take too long, though. My back gets stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I'll start with your blood pressure. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No murmurs, rales, or wheezes noted. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, let's take a look at… yes.
PATIENT: Okay…everything feels a little cold. My back is a little stiff, like I said. Is it… is it finished now, Doctor? I'm feeling a bit… exposed.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s enough for now. Everything appears… within normal limits, for your age. However, we will need to do some blood tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health and hormone levels. It's standard procedure, Manuel. And frankly, given your age and the fact you’re hoping to start a family, it’s essential. We need to rule out any underlying issues. I'll write you a requisition for the tests. It will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a hormone panel. You'll need to go to the lab on Elm Street. They're open until 5 PM today.
PATIENT: Blood tests... hormone panel? That sounds… complicated. Elm Street... I think I know where that is. My wife usually takes me for these things. Is it… will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it's not too long. My wife is very eager… she’s been talking about little grandchildren.
DOCTOR: The blood tests themselves will be a minor prick, nothing to worry about. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days for the lab to process them and for us to receive them. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Here is the requisition. And frankly, Manuel, I must advise you to manage your expectations. Starting a family at your age is… challenging. But we'll see what the tests reveal. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Challenging…? Oh. My wife didn’t say it would be challenging. She just said… we could try. I don't want to disappoint her. She’s been looking at baby clothes, you see. No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… tell me if anything is very wrong, okay? I’m an old man, I don’t understand all these medical things.
DOCTOR: Very well, Manuel. We will review the results thoroughly and discuss them with you. If anything concerning arises, we will contact you immediately. Please, do try to follow up with the lab as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Manuel. .
