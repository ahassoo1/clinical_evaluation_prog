DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Roseburrough, was it? Yes, lovely name. Honestly, it's about a letter. A letter for my… well, for the dog, really. Something about owning a pet. My niece said I needed something from a doctor. I can’t quite remember why, though. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Roseburrough. And no problem at all, things can be confusing. It sounds like this visit is to fulfill a requirement for owning a pet in the area – specifically, documentation for your dog’s rabies vaccination and a quick check-up to ensure everything's in order. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, is that what it is? Rabies… right. The dog had a shot, I’m sure of it. The vet… somewhere. Honestly, I don’t keep track of those things. My niece handles all that. She's very… particular. A check-up, you say? Well, as long as you don’t poke and prod too much, I suppose. Is it going to take long? I have… things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll keep it as quick as possible. Just a basic examination to make sure your dog is healthy, and verify the vaccination record. Do you happen to know the name of the veterinary clinic that provided the shot, or roughly when it was given?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The vet… it was a young man, I believe. Very nice fellow. The clinic… oh dear. It was… somewhere near the market, I think? A small place. Brightly colored, maybe? Honestly, my memory is just dreadful these days. It was… last year, I suppose. Or maybe the year before? It’s all blending together. I really should write these things down, shouldn't I? But then I’d lose that piece of paper, I’m sure of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries at all. Let's talk about your dog for a moment. What breed is he or she?
PATIENT: Oh, he's a lovely dog. A big one. Well, not huge, but… substantial. He’s a… oh, what is he? A mixed breed, definitely. My niece picked him out. She said he was a… a rescue. Something about a… a Labrador cross? Maybe? He’s got a lovely coat, very shiny. Brown and… sort of golden. Very friendly, though. A bit boisterous, but good-natured. He loves his biscuits, that’s for sure. Honestly, I don’t know much about dogs. I just like having him around. He's good company.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. A friendly dog is a great companion. Since we're completing this check-up to satisfy the local ordinance, I'd like to quickly examine him – just a general look at his eyes, ears, teeth, and listen to his heart and lungs. Would you mind if we brought him in?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Bring him in. He's probably thrilled to get out of the car, actually. He loves car rides, but he gets restless after a while. Just… try not to frighten him, alright? He’s a bit sensitive. And please, don't poke too much. He doesn’t like that either. Honestly, he’s a bit of a spoiled dog, my niece spoils him rotten. He’s used to a very comfortable life, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as gentle and quick as possible. I promise. We want to make this a positive experience for him. Let’s get him comfortable in here. Is he with you now?
PATIENT: Yes, he's right outside. My niece brought him, actually. She said she had an appointment, something about… hair, I think. She dropped him off with me. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to her details. She’s a very busy young woman. He’s probably sitting by the car, waiting for her. He loves people, so he's not upset. Just… impatient, perhaps. He lets you know when he wants attention, you see. A little bark, a little whine. Very expressive dog. He’ll come when I call him.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Hello there! It's lovely to meet both of you. Why don't we bring him over here to get started?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s my niece, Abimbola. Abimbola, dear, this is Doctor Roseburrough. She’s going to… check the dog. Yes, that’s it. Don't worry, Abimbola, she promises to be gentle. Honestly, you’d think I was the one getting the check-up, the way she's fussing! Go on, dear. Let the doctor take a look. And try not to tell him it’s okay if it stings. He’s very sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Hello there, handsome! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m just going to take a quick look at you, okay?
