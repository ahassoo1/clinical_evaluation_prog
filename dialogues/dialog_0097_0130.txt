DOCTOR: Hi Jim, welcome in. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my sister, she… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mom, she had it too, a long time ago. I… I’m okay now, but I worry. Just want to make sure I don’t get it, you know? Just want some peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jim. It’s incredibly natural to worry when you’ve had family experience with something like cancer. It’s good you're being proactive about your health. So, you’re coming in today mostly for reassurance and perhaps some screening to check things out?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds right. Reassurance… and check things. What things do you check, Doctor? I don’t know much about this. What kind of tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, well, let’s talk about that. There are a lot of ways we can approach this. Since your concerns are related to cancer given your family history, we’ll focus on some general cancer screening and assess your overall risk. First, could you tell me a little bit more about your sister and your mom?
PATIENT: My sister… she got sick maybe two years ago? Lung cancer. She smoked a lot, I think. My mom… she had it in her breast. A long time ago, maybe 30 years? She’s gone now. She got better for a while, but… it came back. I don’t know… what does that mean for me? I never smoked.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Jim. Knowing the types of cancer and roughly when they were diagnosed is helpful. The fact that you’ve never smoked is very positive, especially considering your sister’s lung cancer. Family history does increase your risk, but it doesn’t mean you will get cancer. We want to be thoughtful about this. Let me pull up your chart quickly. Okay, I see you're 73 years old. Medicare is listed as your insurance. What other medical conditions do you have, if any?
PATIENT: Just… old age, I guess? My knees hurt sometimes. And my back. But who doesn't? I get a little tired easy too. Nothing… serious. Doctor, what are you looking for, exactly? Is there something specific I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Jim. And it’s good you're aware of what's going on with your body. We'll focus on screenings recommended for your age and gender. Given your family history, we may add a few extras. Generally, for men your age, we'd be looking at things like prostate cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, and checking for any changes in skin or moles that could be concerning. We will also do a general physical exam to look at your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no, I don’t take any pills. Just… vitamins sometimes, you know? The old people vitamins. Nothing special. But... what is a prostate cancer screening? That sounds… scary. What do you do? Is it painful? My friend said something about… well, never mind. It sounded awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jim. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned about those types of screenings. Let me explain. A prostate cancer screening usually involves a prostate-specific antigen blood test, and sometimes a digital rectal exam . The PSA test measures a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels can indicate prostate cancer, but many other things can raise the PSA too – like an enlarged prostate, or even infection. The DRE is where the concern usually comes from. It involves a brief exam with a gloved, lubricated finger to feel the prostate gland for any abnormalities. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it's typically very quick. We can certainly discuss whether you are comfortable with both, or just the blood test. Before we decide anything, let's get a better understanding of your overall health. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Okay… that… sounds a little scary. I think… maybe just the blood test for now. No… no poking, please. A quick physical exam… what does that involve? Just… listening to my heart? Checking my breathing? I don't want you looking down there or anything. I’m an old man, Doctor, I know my body. I just want to make sure I'm not going to get sick like them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jim. We’ll absolutely respect your wishes and start with just the blood test. We can always revisit other options later if needed. A quick physical exam involves listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, checking your blood pressure, looking at your throat and ears, and feeling your abdomen. I’ll also check your reflexes. It’s a standard check-up to get a baseline assessment of your health and isn’t meant to be invasive. We'll also check your weight, as I see it’s a bit lower than expected. Let's start with that, and then we can discuss the results. Before we do that, let me ask a quick question about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, ever. And I haven't had a drink in… oh, must be 20 years. Maybe more. It wasn’t good for me, so I stopped. Used to drink beer, sometimes. But not anymore. Just… water and vitamins, mostly. I try to be good.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Jim. It's great that you’ve made those healthy choices. Okay, no alcohol, no tobacco. That's excellent. Now, let's do that quick physical exam. If you don’t mind, I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your heart and lungs, then check your abdomen and reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay… alright. Just… be gentle, Doctor. Old bones, you know? Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jim. We will take it slow and be as gentle as possible. I have the table adjusted to a comfortable height, and I'll help you get settled. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale… good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, though I hear a slight wheeze with exhalation. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… feels a little empty, maybe? I lost a lot of weight lately, I think. I haven't been eating much. Just… not hungry. Is that bad? It just… doesn’t taste good anymore, you know? Everything tastes like nothing.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Jim. Losing weight without trying and a decreased appetite can be concerning. We'll need to investigate that further. No masses or tenderness. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Alright, Jim, that concludes the quick physical exam. Overall, your vital signs are stable, but I did notice some diminished appetite and slight wheezing. Weight loss and changes in appetite warrant further investigation. Let's discuss some potential next steps. We've got the PSA blood test ordered, and I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better understanding of your overall health. I also want to check your thyroid function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. Whatever you think, Doctor. Just… tell me if something’s wrong, okay? I don’t want to be scared. And… how long for the blood tests? And do I have to fast? I haven’t eaten anything since yesterday.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jim. We'll take everything one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly. I'm ordering those tests now. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw, which you've already done. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment, or you can walk in. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Given your weight loss and decreased appetite, I’m also going to ask a few questions about your bowel habits. Have you experienced any changes in your stool lately?
PATIENT: Changes… um… Well… I haven't been going as much. And… when I do… it’s… darker. Not normal. Sorry… it's not a nice thing to talk about. And a little… thin. Like pencils. Is that… bad? It’s been going on for a couple of weeks, maybe more. I didn't think much of it. Old people things, you know? But now you ask…
DOCTOR: It's alright, Jim. These are important things to talk about, and you’re doing the right thing by letting me know. Changes in bowel habits like that do need to be investigated. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to rule out potential causes. Given your family history of cancer, the weight loss, the decreased appetite, the darker, thinner stools, and the diminished bowel movements, I'm concerned about potential gastrointestinal issues, possibly even colon cancer. I am referring you to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. It's the best way to get a definitive diagnosis and rule out any serious problems. Would you like me to help you schedule that appointment, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…? Oh… no… No, thank you. I've heard about those. I don’t want anything… sticking up there. No, I don't want that. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe… more blood tests? I just want to know if I'm going to be okay. I don't want… procedures. I’m too old for that. .
DOCTOR: Jim, I understand your apprehension, and I respect your wishes. However, given the constellation of symptoms you’re describing – the weight loss, appetite changes, altered bowel habits, and your family history – a colonoscopy is the most responsible next step to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. It's the gold standard for evaluating these symptoms. I want to be upfront and honest with you: ignoring these symptoms could lead to a delay in diagnosis, which can significantly impact treatment options and outcomes. I would never recommend a procedure without believing it’s truly necessary for your health. We can discuss the preparation process and what to expect during the procedure in detail. It is a relatively safe and well-tolerated procedure, and we will take every precaution to ensure your comfort and safety. However, if you are absolutely opposed to a colonoscopy, we can consider a fecal immunochemical test as an initial screening tool. It’s a less invasive test, but it’s less accurate than a colonoscopy and may require follow-up testing if the results are positive. Which option would you prefer, Jim?
