DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, welcome! I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Chriselda. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s been concerning me. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent and uncomfortable bladder pressure. That's good you're getting it checked out. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it began, I believe, approximately three weeks ago. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase in how often I feel the need to go. At first, I attributed it to drinking more water with the heat, but it hasn’t lessened even with cooler temperatures.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, gradual onset… and it’s not tied to your fluid intake. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, not that I’ve observed. The color seems normal, and I haven’t seen any blood or anything unusual like that. The stream is… well, normal too. It doesn’t burn or hurt when I go, just the feeling of needing to go often.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in the urine itself, normal stream, just the frequency. Have you been having any fever, chills, or back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and my back feels perfectly fine. It really is just this pressure and the urge to urinate so frequently. It’s… disruptive, to be honest. I work from home as a graphic designer, and even that is becoming difficult with needing to step away so often.
DOCTOR: Okay, disruptive is a good way to put it. And it's good to hear no fever or back pain. Do you have any pain or discomfort when you urinate, or is it purely the sensation of needing to go frequently?
PATIENT: It’s purely the sensation of needing to go, Chriselda. There’s absolutely no pain during urination. It just feels… full, very quickly, and then the pressure returns soon after I’ve gone. It’s quite odd, really. It doesn’t feel like a typical urinary tract infection, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and you're right, it doesn't sound like a typical UTI presentation. Okay. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you had any urinary problems in the past – infections, bladder issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I’ve always had good health, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing specifically related to my bladder or urinary system. I have Medicare, and I've kept up with my preventative care, so I think anything like that would have been noted. My husband always reminds me to schedule my checkups!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And Medicare is great for keeping track of things. Okay, how about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I did have my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was a very routine procedure, and I recovered quickly. Other than that, nothing. I consider myself quite healthy, which is why this bladder issue is so concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And you said you've been generally healthy. What about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had some kidney stones when she was older, but nothing related to bladder issues specifically. My father was healthy as well, no major medical problems that I’m aware of. My siblings are also in good health. We don't have a strong history of urinary problems, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no strong family history of urinary issues. And you mentioned you work from home. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner – perhaps once or twice a week – but I do not drink heavily. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle, mostly due to my husband's influence, actually. He's very health-conscious!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. And you said you’re on Medicare. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not currently taking any medications. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I do take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one, but that’s it. I try to get most of my nutrients from my diet. And as I mentioned, I have Medicare, so I'm sure they have a record of anything I've been prescribed in the past, though I haven’t needed anything for quite some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just a daily multivitamin. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Marialena, I think I have a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve listening to your abdomen and a quick external exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Chriselda. I am comfortable with that. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I would like to understand what is happening, and I trust your professional judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. It sounds… normal, no tenderness to the touch. I don't feel any masses. Now, I'm just going to do a quick external exam. Everything looks normal externally as well. No signs of infection or anything unusual. Your vital signs are also within the normal range: blood pressure 120/80, pulse 72, temperature 98.6. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it doesn’t sound like a typical UTI. However, frequent urination without pain can be caused by a number of things – including bladder sensitivity, an overactive bladder, or even just dietary factors. To rule out a UTI and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. A urinalysis and urine culture sound like a sensible next step. I would greatly appreciate knowing definitively what is going on. Please, proceed with those tests. I want to get to the bottom of this and alleviate this discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll get the order for the urinalysis and urine culture sent to the lab. You’ll be asked to provide a urine sample, and the lab will contact you with the results – usually within a couple of days. While we wait for those results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake slightly – aim for about eight glasses of water a day – but avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. I also suggest keeping a bladder diary for a few days – just write down when you urinate, how much you drink, and any symptoms you experience. That can help us identify any patterns. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable, Chriselda. Increasing my water intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol is easy enough. And keeping a bladder diary is a good idea; it might help me pinpoint what’s contributing to this. I will certainly do that. Thank you for outlining those steps so clearly. Is there anything else I should be aware of while we wait for the lab results?
DOCTOR: No, not at this time. If you develop a fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact us immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious infection. Otherwise, just try to stay hydrated, avoid bladder irritants, and keep that diary. We'll review the results as soon as they come in, and then we'll discuss the best course of action. If the results are normal, we can consider other possibilities, like an overactive bladder or bladder sensitivity, and potentially refer you to a urologist if needed. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very reasonable plan, Chriselda. I appreciate your thoroughness and your clear explanation of the next steps. I will monitor myself for any concerning symptoms and keep you informed. Thank you for your time and attention to my concerns. I feel much more reassured knowing we’re taking a proactive approach.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could reassure you. Remember, we’re here to help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. Here’s a pamphlet with some helpful information. I'll let the nurse know to expect your urine sample. Have a good day, and please take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Chriselda. I will certainly do that. And thank you for the pamphlet. Have a wonderful day as well. .
