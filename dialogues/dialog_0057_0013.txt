DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always a little bit left. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not every time, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder, and it's been going on for about a month. That’s definitely something we should look into. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t hurt exactly, not like a burning feeling. Just… weak. Like the stream slows way down before it stops, and then… drips a little after. I have to… wait a bit, and then try again sometimes. It's embarrassing, to be honest. I don’t want to have accidents.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s frustrating, and I appreciate you being open about it. It is important to figure out what's going on. You mentioned the stream slows down and you have to wait to get the rest out. Does this happen every time you urinate, or are there times when it's normal?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Sometimes it's fine. A good, strong stream and everything’s out. But… maybe half the times, or more. It’s hard to say for sure. It seems worse if I wait too long to go. If I try to hold it… then it’s really hard to get it all out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, happening more often than not, and seems to be worse when you delay urination. That's helpful information. Have you noticed any other changes in your urination – like increased frequency, urgency, or any pain or burning with urination, even if it's not constant?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I do have to get up maybe once a night now, which I didn't used to. Just a little bit, not a whole lot. And sometimes… I feel like I have to go pretty quick, even if I just went. Not a terrible feeling, but… noticeable. No pain though, never any burning. Just the weak stream and the waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased nighttime urination – nocturia – and a sense of urgency are new symptoms, along with the weak stream and incomplete emptying. No pain or burning, which is good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… my wife… she always took care of all that paperwork. I… I don’t really know. I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but I was taking a pill for it. I stopped taking it when she… passed. I haven't been back to the doctor since then, really. And no, nothing about my prostate. Never heard anything about that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to not be fully aware of all your medical history if someone else manages it. It's good you're coming in now to get things checked out. Okay, so you had high blood pressure in the past, but you're not currently taking medication for it. And no known prostate issues. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. When I was a young man, I broke my leg really bad. Skiing accident. They had to put pins in it. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken leg requiring pins, and an appendectomy as a child. And no other surgeries. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a one. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pill a long time ago. I don’t really take anything. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and berries… what little I can get these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No current medications or supplements. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – father, brothers, uncles – who have had problems with their bladder, kidneys, or prostate?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Let me see. My father… he was a strong man. Never complained about much of anything. I don’t recall him ever talking about bladder problems. My brother… he passed away when he was young, from an accident. Didn’t really talk about health things much either. And… my uncles… lived far away. I didn’t see them often. I’m afraid I don’t know. I wish I did.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. Limited knowledge of family medical history. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I live alone now. My wife… she’s been gone a few years. I mostly stay around the house. I like to fish when I can, but it’s hard to get out as much these days. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. I try to stay active, walking around and doing little chores. It gets lonely, but I manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Hilber. It gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll need to check your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a rectal exam? I… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It's a very personal exam and it’s perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable. However, a digital rectal exam is a very important part of evaluating the prostate, which can cause urinary symptoms like the ones you’re experiencing. It allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate, and can help rule out any abnormalities. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but without it, it’s harder to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's a quick exam, and I will explain everything as I go. I will do my best to make you as comfortable as possible. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: …Alright. If it’s necessary, I suppose. But please… explain everything. Slowly. And… be gentle. I’m just… not used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. I understand. I will explain everything thoroughly, and proceed very slowly and gently. Okay, so what I’m going to do is have you lie on your side, usually your left side, with your knees bent. I'll use a lubricant to make it more comfortable. Then, I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It won’t go very far, just a couple of inches. I'll be feeling for the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. I’ll also be checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. It may feel a little uncomfortable, like you have to move your bowels, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any pain, please let me know immediately. It only takes a minute or two. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: …A minute or two, you say? Alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… please be careful. And tell me if you feel anything… strange. I’m ready, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. Thank you for being so open. Let's get you positioned on your side. I'll explain each step as I go, and please don't hesitate to tell me if you feel any discomfort at all. Alright, now I'm going to gently insert my finger. Take a deep breath… Here we go… Okay… I'm feeling your prostate now. It feels… slightly enlarged. The texture is a little uneven, but not particularly hard. There's no significant tenderness. Alright, all done. That wasn't too bad, was it?
PATIENT: It… wasn’t as awful as I thought it would be. A little uncomfortable, but not painful. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad it wasn't too uncomfortable. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It means your prostate gland has gotten bigger, which can press on your urethra – the tube that carries urine out of your bladder – and cause the urinary symptoms you’ve been experiencing – like difficulty starting and stopping urination, a weak stream, and the feeling of incomplete emptying. It's not necessarily "bad" in the sense of being cancerous, but it can be bothersome and affect your quality of life. We need to rule out other possibilities though. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection and other abnormalities, and a prostate-specific antigen blood test to further evaluate your prostate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urine test and a blood test… Yes, that sounds sensible. If that’s what you think is best. I want to know what’s going on, and get this sorted out. What happens with those tests? How long will it take?
DOCTOR: Good. I agree, those tests are a good next step. The urine test is very simple. You’ll just need to provide a sample in a cup when you come to the lab. The PSA blood test is also straightforward – a quick blood draw. The results usually take a few days to come back, typically 3-5 business days. Once I have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I want you to try to drink plenty of fluids – about 6-8 glasses of water a day – but avoid drinking a lot of liquid right before bedtime to help with the nighttime urination. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions about the tests or these recommendations?
PATIENT: Six to eight glasses of water… That seems like a lot. But I can try. And avoid caffeine and alcohol… alright, I can do that too. No, I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I understand these things can be unsettling, and I'm happy to take the time to explain everything and make you feel comfortable. I’ll have the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they can schedule the tests for you. Once they’ve been completed, we’ll get you scheduled for a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. I appreciate your help. I’ll go schedule those tests now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
