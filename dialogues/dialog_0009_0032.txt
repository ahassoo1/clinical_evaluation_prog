DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Petrimoulx, you say? A… foreign name, isn’t it? Never mind. I’m here because… well, it’s a rather delicate matter. Something… isn’t quite right, down there. A bit of… discharge, you see. Most unpleasant. I haven’t bothered my wife with it; she wouldn’t understand the intricacies of… well, you get the picture.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It can be difficult to discuss these things, and you’ve come to the right place. We’ll get to the bottom of it together. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. When did it start? That’s… difficult to say. Time rather slips away these days, you know. Perhaps a week or so ago? Maybe longer. It’s… yellowish, I believe. Not a great deal of it, thankfully. Just enough to be… bothersome. And rather… smelly. Though I doubt you will notice that. It’s not causing any pain, thankfully. Just… inconvenient. Is that sufficient detail? I haven’t a precise accounting of the matter, I assure you. It's not something one keeps track of.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. It sounds like it started roughly a week ago, yellowish in color, not a large amount, and has an odor. No pain, which is good. To help me get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit… tired, lately. But then again, at my age, one is always a bit tired. Perhaps a little more frequent urination than usual, but that could be the tea. My wife makes a rather strong brew, you see. And… no, I don’t believe so. No burning, no itching, no… rash. Just the discharge and the general feeling of… decrepitude. Is that a symptom? I suppose it could be. Everything aches, you know.
DOCTOR: Decrepitude is a common feeling at 83, Mr. Krok, and certainly doesn’t help us pinpoint the cause of the discharge. Fatigue and increased urination are good things to note, though. Now, have you experienced any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? No, Doctor. I haven’t been shivering in my boots, if that’s what you mean. I do get a bit warm after working in the garden, but that’s just the sun, you see. And sometimes, I feel a bit… flushed after a glass of sherry with dinner. But those aren’t fevers, are they? Just… comfortable warmth. No, no chills. Definitely not. I pride myself on my constitution, you know. I haven’t been truly sick in years. A bit of a sniffle, perhaps, but nothing of consequence.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Krok. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my… bowel habits? Really, Doctor? Is that truly necessary? This is a delicate matter, as we’ve established, and I fail to see the relevance of… that. Still… I suppose if you insist. Well, they’ve been… regular, shall we say. Perhaps a little… looser than usual, but nothing alarming. I attribute that to the peaches. My wife has been buying rather ripe peaches lately. A bit of… indigestion, perhaps, but nothing to write home about. Must we delve into such… personal details? It’s rather undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok, and I apologize if I've been too intrusive. It’s just that these details can sometimes help us understand the bigger picture. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history, eh? Well, I’ve always been a robust individual. I used to be a very active man, working on the farm, you see. As for existing conditions… my wife insists my blood pressure is a bit high, but she worries about everything. She makes me take those little pills every morning, but I can’t say I’ve noticed any difference. No diabetes, thankfully. I’ve always avoided sweets. Though I do enjoy a good sherry now and then… No, no serious conditions. Just the usual aches and pains of old age. A bit of arthritis in the knees. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. But nothing… consequential. I assure you. A very healthy man for my age, all things considered. Though perhaps a bit… tired these days. But that’s neither here nor there.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some arthritis in the knees, slightly elevated blood pressure managed with medication, and some difficulty with eyesight. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. Now… years ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix removed. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… oh, yes! I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder while repairing the barn roof. They set it in a cast for several weeks. And… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing else. No hospitalizations, aside from those two incidents. Nothing serious. Just the usual bumps and scrapes of farm life. I’ve always been a resilient individual. I heal quickly, you see. Though perhaps not as quickly as I used to. But still. A very healthy man for my age. Aside from this… discharge, of course. Which is rather bothersome, I must say. And… smelly. Do you think it’s serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, so appendix removal and a broken arm in the past. It’s good to have that information. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Good heavens, Doctor. Where does one begin? My father… he lived to a ripe old age, thankfully. Worked on the farm his entire life, just like me. Mother… she passed away when I was a young man. A bit of heart trouble, I believe. As for siblings… I had two brothers and a sister. One brother passed away a few years ago, from… well, I can’t quite recall. Something to do with his lungs, I think. The other brother is still alive, but we haven’t spoken in years. And my sister… she moved to America many years ago. We rarely correspond. As for illnesses… there was a bit of diabetes on my mother’s side, I believe. And my grandfather… he had some trouble with his prostate, I recall. But that was many years ago. A rather… unremarkable family history, all things considered. Mostly just hard-working farmers. And a bit of diabetes. And a problematic prostate. Is that useful information, Doctor? It all seems rather… distant now.
DOCTOR: That is helpful information, Mr. Krok. So, some diabetes and prostate issues in the family. Now, regarding your social history, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! A dreadful habit. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said it was a waste of good money. As for alcohol… well, I enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner now and then. A small glass, mind you. Just to relax. And perhaps a bit more on special occasions. A celebratory toast, you see. Or to warm myself on a cold evening. But nothing excessive. I assure you. I’m a very moderate drinker. And I certainly don’t have a problem with it. A civilized indulgence, that’s all. Do you suspect I have a problem, Doctor? Because I assure you, I do not. It's merely a small pleasure in life. Is that sufficient information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly sufficient, Mr. Krok. A small glass of sherry with dinner is perfectly reasonable. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Now, let me think. As far as I recall, no. I've never had a reaction to any medication. My wife gives me those little pills every morning, as you know, and I haven't experienced any ill effects. I do get a bit of a rash sometimes, after working in the garden, but that's just the nettles, you see. And I’m not particularly fond of shellfish, but that's more a matter of taste than an allergy. No, no allergies. A very robust constitution, as I’ve mentioned. No, not a single allergy. I assure you. Is that all, Doctor? Because I'm beginning to feel rather tired now. All these questions… it's rather exhausting, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the information I need for now, Mr. Krok. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a brief examination of the area of concern. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Really, Doctor? Is that absolutely necessary? It sounds… invasive. I’m not a young man, you know. And I’m not particularly fond of being prodded and poked. But… I suppose if you insist. I trust you’ll be gentle? And discreet, of course. I wouldn’t want the nurses gossiping. But… very well. Proceed, but please be quick about it. And do explain what you’re doing, so I don’t get alarmed. And please, for goodness sake, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. I'll explain everything as I go along. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. There's no tenderness or masses here. Finally, I’ll need to examine the area of concern. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. But do be quick about it. It’s rather… unnerving, you know. And please, explain what you’re doing. I don't like surprises. And for goodness sake, be gentle. I’m a sensitive man, despite my age. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… undignified. But I suppose it’s necessary. If you insist. Just… hurry it along. I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, don’t ask me to… expose myself unnecessarily. That would be most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand your discomfort, and I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. I’m just checking for any swelling, redness, or discharge. I notice some mild redness and a small amount of discharge. The area is slightly tender to the touch. There are no palpable masses. Based on my examination, it appears you may have a mild case of balanitis, an inflammation of the glans of the penis. The redness and discharge are consistent with this diagnosis. However, to confirm this and rule out any other potential causes, I recommend a urine test and a swab of the discharge for analysis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Balan… what now? Balanitis? Good heavens, Doctor, that sounds dreadful. Is it… serious? And a urine test? And a… swab? Honestly, this is becoming increasingly unpleasant. Is there no other way? Can’t you just… prescribe something? Some sort of ointment, perhaps? I really don’t want to be poked and prodded any further. And a swab… it sounds… invasive. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a young man. I’ve lived a long life, and I’d rather not spend the rest of it in a clinic, being examined. But… if it’s absolutely necessary… Very well. Proceed. But please, be quick about it. And be gentle. And explain everything. I don’t want any surprises. Honestly, this is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Krok, and I apologize for any discomfort. The tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and ensure we provide you with the most appropriate treatment. Balanitis itself isn’t usually serious, but it can be caused by various factors, including infection or irritation. The urine test will help rule out any underlying infection, and the swab will allow us to identify any specific bacteria or fungi causing the inflammation. The urine test is a simple procedure. You will simply be asked to provide a sample in a sterile container. The swab involves gently collecting a small sample of the discharge. It will be quick and shouldn't be painful. Would you like me to have the nurse assist you with collecting the samples?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If it must be done. But please, no poking and prodding. And do try to be discreet. I wouldn’t want the nurses gossiping. And please, have a female nurse assist me. I… I’d feel more comfortable with a woman. A male nurse… well, that would be most unpleasant. Honestly, this is all rather… undignified. But if it’s absolutely necessary… Very well. But be quick about it. And gentle. And discreet. And please, have a female nurse. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a long life, and I’d rather not spend the rest of it in a clinic, being examined. But… if it must be done, let’s get it over with. Just… hurry it along. And please, no surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will ensure a female nurse assists you. I'll ask Nurse Anya to come in and assist you with collecting the samples. She is very experienced and will be as gentle and discreet as possible. Nurse Anya, could you please come to examination room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Very well. I trust she’s a… competent nurse? I don't want any… mishaps. Honestly, this is all rather… unsettling. I haven’t been examined like this in… well, a very long time. And I’d rather not spend the rest of my days reliving the experience. But… if it must be done, let’s get it over with. Just… hurry it along. And please, let her be gentle. And discreet. Honestly, this is all rather… undignified. But… very well. I suppose I’m resigned to my fate. Just… hurry it along. And please, let her be gentle. And discreet.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya will be with you shortly, Mr. Krok. While we wait, I’m just reviewing your medical history. It appears you are up-to-date on your tetanus vaccination, which is good. I see you also take medication for slightly elevated blood pressure. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. My wife makes sure of it. She’s rather… insistent on my taking those little pills every morning. I don’t particularly notice any difference, but she insists they’re necessary. Honestly, she worries about everything. A bit of a hypochondriac, if you ask me. But… very well. I take the pills. And I suppose they’re doing something. Though I can’t say for certain what. Honestly, this is all rather… bothersome. All these questions. All this prodding and poking. And all this… discharge. Honestly, I’ve lived a long life, and I’d rather not spend the rest of it in a clinic, being examined. But… very well. I suppose I’m resigned to my fate. Just… hurry it along. And please, let her be gentle. And discreet. And please, let her be gentle. I'm growing tired, Doctor. Very tired indeed.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Krok. I assure you, we’ll get this sorted out as quickly and comfortably as possible. And I appreciate your patience. Nurse Anya: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Dr. Petrimoulx has explained everything to me. I'll be assisting you with collecting the urine and swab samples. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Are you ready when you are?
PATIENT: Good morning. If I must. Honestly, this is all rather… undignified. I suppose I’m resigned to my fate. Just… be quick about it. And gentle. Very gentle. And please, don’t ask me any… embarrassing questions. I’ve lived a long life, and I’d rather not relive it in detail. Honestly, this is all rather… bothersome. Just… get it over with. Quickly and gently. And discreetly. And please, no surprises. Honestly, this is all rather… undignified. Perhaps a glass of sherry would help. But no, that would probably complicate matters. Just… get it over with. Quickly and gently. And discreetly. And please, no surprises. Honestly, I'm very tired. Very tired indeed.
DOCTOR: Nurse Anya: Of course, Mr. Krok. I completely understand. We'll make this as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll leave you some privacy to collect the urine sample first. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished. I'll be right outside.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I wish you a good day, and we'll be in touch with the results shortly. If you experience any worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. .
