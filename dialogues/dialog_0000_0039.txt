DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bohnett, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Batara. Now, you're 88 years young, and… quite slight, aren't you?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I’ve always been a bit on the thin side, even when I was a young man working. Not much of an appetite, you see. But I get by. Is that a problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Especially at your age. Being underweight can mean your body doesn’t have the reserves it needs to fight off illness, and it can affect your strength and energy levels. We’ll need to get a better understanding of why you don't have much of an appetite. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, right. The cholesterol. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s always looking out for me, made me come in. Said the numbers weren’t good on that blood test. I don’t really feel sick, Doctor. Just… tired sometimes, like anyone my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, daughters do worry. And it’s good they do. High cholesterol often doesn't feel like anything, that's the problem. But it can lead to serious trouble down the road. Now, do you happen to know what your cholesterol numbers were?
PATIENT: No, not a clue, Doctor. My daughter explained it to me, something about LDL and HDL… numbers and all. It just didn’t stick. She said it was too high, that's all I really know. I mostly just try to take things as they come.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… yes, your LDL is quite elevated, at 185. Your HDL is… not ideal, either, at 35. And your total cholesterol is 250. Those are numbers we need to address. Now, do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Not that I know of. My father had a bit of a cough towards the end, but that was just old age, I always figured. I've never been to a cardiologist or anything like that. I worked hard all my life, mostly physical labor, and never had much trouble with my heart before. What exactly does high cholesterol do, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's... frustrating when people don't take preventative measures. High cholesterol, Mr. Bohnett, means you have too much of a fatty substance in your blood. Over time, that buildup can form plaques in your arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. Think of a pipe getting clogged. That can lead to chest pain, heart attack, stroke… serious things. Now, have you been diagnosed with diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh my, that doesn’t sound good at all. A clogged pipe… I can picture that. No, never diabetes. My blood pressure, I think my daughter mentioned something about it being a little high once, but the doctor said not to worry too much about it. Just watch the salt, she said. I do love a good pickled herring, you see. Does the herring have anything to do with this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Pickled herring isn’t helping, no. High salt intake contributes to high blood pressure, which can worsen cholesterol issues. It’s a… domino effect, really. Now, let’s talk about your diet in general. Besides the herring, what do you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not much, honestly. Breakfast is usually just a piece of toast, maybe with a little butter. Lunch is often a sandwich, ham or cheese, nothing fancy. And dinner… my daughter brings me something most nights, usually soup or a small plate of meat and potatoes. I don’t eat a lot of vegetables, I’ve never been a fan, and sweets… not much for sweets either. I just don't have a big appetite, like I said. It's been that way for years.
DOCTOR: Right. Limited diet, low appetite. And no regular exercise, I presume?
PATIENT: Exercise? No, not really. I used to do a lot of walking when I was working, but I retired years ago and… well, I mostly just sit these days. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and honestly, I get tired pretty easily. I mostly enjoy reading and listening to the radio. Quiet things.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, limited diet, low appetite, no exercise. That… explains a lot. Now, before we discuss treatment options, I need to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, the usual. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear, but breathing is somewhat shallow. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is elevated. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are a bit diminished. Everything seems… consistent with your age and lifestyle, but we do need to address these numbers.
PATIENT: Consistent… that doesn’t sound too bad, does it? But you said we need to address the numbers. What does that mean, Doctor? Are you going to give me medicine? I don't really like taking pills, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bohnett, medication is often necessary in cases like yours. Lifestyle changes are important, absolutely, but at your age and with these numbers, they likely won't be enough on their own. A statin would be the typical course of action. It helps lower your LDL cholesterol. We could start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. However, before we jump to medication, I want to run a few more tests. A lipid panel to confirm your cholesterol levels, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We need to make sure you're a good candidate for a statin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Alright, Doctor, if you think it's best. I suppose I can handle a few more needles. But what happens if these tests show something is wrong? What if my kidneys aren’t working right? I don’t want to cause any trouble. I just want to feel a bit better, not… worse.
DOCTOR: That’s a reasonable concern, Mr. Bohnett. It’s good you’re asking questions. If the tests do show something is amiss with your kidneys or liver, we'll adjust the treatment plan accordingly. We might need to consult with a nephrologist or a hepatologist – specialists in those areas. But don’t jump to conclusions. It’s more likely the tests will be normal, or only show minor issues we can manage. I’ll have the nurse draw blood now. It will take a few days to get the results back. Once I have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A plan sounds good. As long as you’ll explain everything to me, Doctor, I trust your judgment. Just… don't let it be too complicated. I'm an old man, and I get confused easily. And thank you for being patient with me. I know I’m probably not the easiest patient.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I expect you to be forthright with your concerns. I’ll make sure the nurse explains the blood draw procedure. And no, I’ll keep it simple. We’ll take things one step at a time. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: .
