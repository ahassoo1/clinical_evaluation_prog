DOCTOR: Hi Gabbrielle, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… fine, I suppose. I’m here about this… patch on my skin. It’s just… not right. It’s been bothering me, and frankly, it’s quite unsightly. I noticed it about three weeks ago, I believe. August 2nd, 2025, to be exact. I keep very good track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks… that’s good to know you’ve been keeping track of it. "Not right" and "unsightly" – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's… discolored. Not a nice color, you understand. A sort of… muddy brown. And it’s slightly raised. Not terribly, but enough to feel it if you run your hand over it. It's on my left forearm, just above the wrist. Really, it’s just… disturbing. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully, but it looks rather… peasant-like, if you catch my drift. I’m quite particular about my appearance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Discoloration and a raised patch on your left forearm... and you're concerned about its appearance. No pain is good. Before we go further, can you tell me if it's changed at all in the three weeks since you noticed it?
PATIENT: Yes, it has changed, actually. It’s… grown, I think. Not dramatically, but it’s definitely larger than when I first spotted it. And the color… it’s a little darker now, a deeper brown. I’ve been observing it quite closely, and it seems… a bit rougher, almost scaly around the edges. Honestly, it’s becoming quite worrisome. One doesn’t simply develop these… blemishes, you know. It must be something… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, growing and becoming darker and rougher... that’s good information. It’s good you're paying close attention. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No itching, no bleeding, no… discharge of any kind. It doesn’t feel warm or particularly cold. It just… is. Though, I have been feeling a little more tired lately, but frankly, who isn't tired these days? I suspect it's the humidity. And my husband keeps leaving the lights on. Honestly, the stress of that alone could cause anything, I suppose. But no, directly related to the patch… no. Just the general weariness of life, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other skin changes, no itching, bleeding, or discharge. Just the fatigue, which you attribute to other factors. That's helpful. Let's take a look at it. Would you mind rolling up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here. Be careful, Doctor. I do try to keep it covered, you see. One never knows what germs are lurking.
DOCTOR: Okay. It is roughly circular, about the size you mentioned. It does feel slightly raised, and the texture is a bit rough. It's well-defined, but not sharply edged. No immediate tenderness to touch. I'm going to take a quick look at your lymph nodes in your armpit, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lymph nodes? Oh. Well, if you must. I suppose it’s part of the process. But please be gentle. I don’t like being poked and prodded, you understand. And do explain what you're doing, I don't appreciate surprises. Honestly, one really shouldn't have to come to the doctor for such… indignities. But I trust you're a professional. Proceed, then. But gently.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. We're just checking for any swelling in the lymph nodes, which can sometimes indicate infection or inflammation. It's a standard part of the exam. Okay. I don’t feel any significant swelling or tenderness in your lymph nodes. That’s good. It doesn’t immediately suggest anything concerning in that regard. Based on what I'm seeing and feeling, this could be a number of things, but it's definitely something we need to investigate further. It could be a benign skin growth, or it could be something else. To be certain, I’d like to get a biopsy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh, dear. A biopsy… That sounds rather… invasive, doesn't it? What exactly does that involve? And will it leave a scar? Because I absolutely cannot abide a scar. It simply wouldn't do. I’ve always been very careful about my skin, you see. I use a lovely cream imported from Ukraine… But a biopsy… honestly, is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps it's just a harmless… age spot? Or a reaction to the humidity? I’m rather skeptical, Doctor. Honestly, I don't see the point of unnecessary procedures. Explain it to me, slowly. And please, reassure me there won't be a noticeable mark.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and your concern about a scar is perfectly valid. A biopsy is the most accurate way to determine what this is. It involves taking a very small sample of the skin and sending it to a lab for analysis. We would use a local anesthetic to numb the area, so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. It's a quick procedure, usually taking just a few minutes. Regarding scarring, we do everything we can to minimize it. We use a very small instrument and often use sutures to close the area. Most biopsies leave a very small, faint mark that fades over time, especially with proper wound care. I can discuss techniques to help minimize scarring, like silicone gel sheeting, if we proceed. I wouldn’t recommend a biopsy if I didn’t think it was important. Because of the changes you’ve noticed – the growth and darkening – it's best to get a definitive diagnosis to rule out anything concerning. It's better to be safe and know exactly what we're dealing with. Would you like me to explain the different possibilities of what this could be, so you have a better understanding of why we’re considering this?
PATIENT: Possibilities? Very well. I suppose I should brace myself for the worst, then. Do explain. But please, don't use any medical jargon. I haven't the foggiest idea what "epithelial" or "melanoma" even mean. Just… plain English, Doctor. And don't try to frighten me. I’m already quite anxious as it is. Honestly, one rarely hears good news at the doctor's office. But proceed. I’m listening. Though I warn you, I’m rather faint-hearted.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything in plain English. There are several possibilities, and most of them are not concerning. One common possibility is a benign growth, like a seborrheic keratosis or a skin tag. These are very common, harmless growths that often appear with age. They don't cause any problems and don't usually require treatment unless they're bothersome. Another possibility is a dysplastic nevus, which is essentially an unusual mole. These aren’t cancerous, but they can sometimes develop into melanoma, so we often remove them as a precaution. Melanoma, which you mentioned, is a more serious type of skin cancer. It’s important to catch it early, and that's why we're considering a biopsy. The good news is that when caught early, melanoma is often very treatable. There are other, less common possibilities as well, like certain types of cysts or inflammatory skin conditions. The biopsy will help us determine exactly what this is, so we can develop the best treatment plan, if any is needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Melanoma… You said cancer? Oh, dear. That sounds… dreadful. And you said it's important to catch it early… That doesn’t sound promising at all. So, this patch… could it be that? It’s growing, you said, and darkening… Oh, this is just awful. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. Is it absolutely necessary to remove it immediately? Perhaps we could… monitor it for a while longer? Take another photograph, perhaps? I’m not sure I’m ready for… removal. Or a diagnosis of… that. Honestly, I need a moment. And a glass of water, please. This is just too much.
DOCTOR: Here, please take a sip of water. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed, and it’s perfectly natural to be anxious when you hear the word "cancer." Let me reassure you, we haven’t diagnosed anything yet. The biopsy is simply a way to get more information. We don’t know if it’s melanoma, or anything concerning at all. However, because you’ve noticed changes – the growth and darkening – it's important to investigate it promptly. Melanoma can spread quickly if left untreated, which is why early detection is so important. I wouldn’t recommend a biopsy if I didn’t think it was important to get a clear diagnosis. And it's much better to know for sure, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. We can absolutely discuss all your options, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. If the biopsy shows anything concerning, we can discuss treatment options in detail. Would you like me to explain the biopsy procedure again, so you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: The procedure… yes, perhaps. If you must. But please, be gentle. And explain it slowly, as if I were a child. Honestly, I detest needles. And the thought of… cutting into my skin… it makes me quite nauseous. And what happens afterwards? Will it be painful? Will it bleed? And will it leave a terrible scar? Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint again. And what if it is… that? What then? Will I need… chemotherapy? Or radiation? Oh, dear. This is just awful. Perhaps I should just ignore it. Pretend it's not there. Is that an option? Surely, it will just… go away on its own? Honestly, I'm not sure I can handle this.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take things one step at a time. First, let’s talk about the biopsy procedure. It’s a very quick and relatively painless procedure. I’ll numb the area with a small injection of local anesthetic – that's the part that feels like a tiny pinch. Once the area is numb, I'll use a small instrument to remove a tiny sample of the skin. It’s usually just a few millimeters in size. You might feel a little pressure during the procedure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Afterwards, we’ll apply a small bandage to the area. You might have a little bit of bleeding for a few minutes, but that’s normal. As for scarring, I’ll close the area with sutures to minimize scarring. Most biopsies leave a very small, faint mark that fades over time. I can discuss techniques to help minimize scarring, like silicone gel sheeting, if we proceed. If the biopsy shows anything concerning, we’ll discuss treatment options in detail. The treatment options depend on the type and stage of the skin cancer, if it is indeed cancer. Chemotherapy and radiation are possibilities, but not everyone needs them. We would work with an oncologist – a cancer specialist – to develop the best treatment plan for you. I understand you're feeling overwhelmed, and it's perfectly natural to be anxious. You are not alone in this. I will be with you every step of the way, and we’ll make sure you have all the information and support you need. Ignoring it is not an option, because melanoma can spread quickly if left untreated. But we're not going to jump to any conclusions. We're just going to get a biopsy to get more information. Would you like me to call a nurse to sit with you for a moment?
PATIENT: A nurse… yes, perhaps. That might be helpful. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite dizzy. And the thought of… a specialist… an oncologist… it’s just too much. I’m not ready for all this. Honestly, I came here about a little patch on my skin, and now… now I’m facing… all this. It’s just dreadful. And what if it is serious? What will my husband say? He’s always so… practical. He’ll want to… do something immediately. And I just… I just want to be left alone. Honestly, I think I need a moment to… compose myself. And perhaps a sedative. Is that possible? Before the… biopsy. And before I meet this… oncologist. Honestly, this is just too much. Call the nurse, please. And see if there's anything… calming you can give me. Before I faint completely.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand, and it’s perfectly natural to be feeling overwhelmed. I’ll call the nurse right away, and we can discuss some options to help you feel more calm and comfortable. We can definitely talk about a mild sedative before the biopsy, if that would help. We have a very gentle and compassionate nursing staff who can sit with you and provide support. And I will be here with you every step of the way. We're not going to do anything you're not comfortable with. Just take a deep breath, and try to relax. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll make sure you have all the information and support you need. "Could you please sit with Gabbrielle for a moment?
