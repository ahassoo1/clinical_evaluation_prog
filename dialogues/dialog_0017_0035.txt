DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Blim. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever. Not constantly, mind you, but they just keep coming back. It’s quite annoying, really!
DOCTOR: Forever is a rather imprecise measurement, Ms. Sucich. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, dear, I get carried away with my words sometimes. Let me think… about three days now, I’d say. Started Tuesday, just after lunch. And they come and go, a few at a time, then nothing for a couple of hours. It’s not painful, just… disruptive. I was hoping they'd just go away on their own, but they haven't.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. And has anything… unusual preceded this onset?
PATIENT: Unusual? Hmm… well, my grandson, little Jone, came to visit Monday. He brought me some kava root from his village. Lovely boy, but he gets so excited and we talked for hours, laughing a lot. I had a small bowl of kava with him, just to be polite, you know? Maybe that has something to do with it? I haven’t had kava in ages, really.
DOCTOR: Kava, you say. A rather… unorthodox beverage. And how much, precisely, did you consume?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn't much, Doctor. Truly. Just a small bowl. One of those little coconut shell bowls, maybe… half full? Jone usually drinks a much bigger one, but he offered and I didn't want to be rude. It tasted a little…earthy, if that makes sense. Not unpleasant, but definitely different from my usual tea. Is kava root supposed to cause hiccups?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sucich, while I wouldn’t say it’s supposed to, kava does have muscle relaxant properties. Sometimes, those sorts of things can disrupt…normal bodily functions. Now, let’s move on. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Disrupt bodily functions, you say? That doesn't sound good! No, no other symptoms really. Just the hiccups, of course. No pain, no dizziness, no trouble breathing… everything else feels perfectly normal. Appetite’s good, sleep’s good… even my memory’s still working, thankfully! Although, I am 86, so who knows what’s normal anymore?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, age does complicate things. Now, tell me about your medical history, Ms. Sucich. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps… nothing serious. Years ago, when I was in my fifties, I had my gallbladder taken out. That was a bit unpleasant, but I recovered well. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees for a while, but it mostly comes and goes with the weather. Oh! And I broke my wrist a few years back when I tripped in the garden. Nothing major, though. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Always been a strong Fijian woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, gallbladder removal… and any family history of… anything notable?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… my mother, she lived to be 92, very healthy woman. She had a bit of high blood pressure in her later years, but that was managed with medication. My father… he passed away when I was young, a heart condition, I believe. And my brother, he had diabetes, but he wasn’t very good at looking after himself, poor man. That's about all I can remember, really. We weren't much for talking about illnesses back then. Mostly just toughed it out, you see.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, Doctor. Something to help with the arthritis when the weather’s bad. It’s called… um… let me see… Ah, here we are! Naproxen, 500mg. I only take it when I need to, usually just a couple of times a week. Nothing else, I promise!
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Never had a reaction to anything, knock on wood! I always thought I was pretty lucky in that regard. My mother always said good Fijian blood protects you from most things, and maybe she was right! I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, you see, and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Sucich, I'm going to perform a brief examination. It will involve listening to your lungs, checking your reflexes, and a quick abdominal exam. It's standard procedure. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My old bones aren’t quite as nimble as they used to be! It’s good to get checked out, though. Always best to be safe, you know.
DOCTOR: Please lie supine, Ms. Sucich. I'll start with auscultation of your lungs. Take deep breaths… in and out. Lungs sound clear. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi noted.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Deep breaths… in… and out… Yes, feeling a bit drafty in here, but that’s alright. It’s good to feel you checking, though. It’s reassuring. Just a little tickle in my throat. Hopefully, it won't bother you. I always get a bit nervous at the doctor’s, you see.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no guarding. Bowel sounds are normoactive. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally in upper and lower extremities. Now, please take a deep breath and exhale. I will listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little tender right there, Doctor, near my belly button. Nothing painful, just a bit sensitive. Probably just old age, you know? My heart feels alright, I think. Beats steady enough when I’m not running around. It’s good to know everything sounds… normal, though. I do appreciate you checking me over so thoroughly. It’s been a while since I had a proper exam.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich. Based on my examination and your history, it seems your symptoms are likely due to a benign case of spontaneous hiccups. While the kava root is an unusual element, it's unlikely to be the sole cause. It's likely a coincidence. There are a few home remedies you could try – holding your breath, drinking water quickly, or sucking on a lemon. If they persist beyond a week, or if they are accompanied by other symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain, please return for further evaluation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s reassuring to hear it’s probably nothing serious. Spontaneous hiccups… fancy that! I’ve always been a bit of a nervous person, so maybe that’s it. I’ll try those remedies – holding my breath sounds tricky, but I can certainly manage the water and the lemon. Yes, I suppose I did wonder if it could be something more serious. It’s good to know it’s likely just a harmless little annoyance. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and for checking me over. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sucich. This summary details our findings and recommendations. Please follow up if your symptoms worsen. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Yes, this is very helpful. No, I don't think that’s all. I appreciate you taking the time to see me, even though it turned out to be just hiccups. You’ve been very kind. I think I’ll just be going now. Thank you again. Have a good day, Doctor Blim. .
DOCTOR: Good day, Ms. Sucich.
