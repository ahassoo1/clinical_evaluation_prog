DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, usually. But… well, I’ve been, uh, losing blood. Not a little bit, either. It's… coming from down there. Just started a couple days ago, really. And it ain’t pretty.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds concerning that you're experiencing bleeding, and you're right to get it checked out. It's good you came in. “Down there” – just to be clear, are we talking about rectal bleeding, or bleeding from the urethra when you urinate?
PATIENT: Rectal, Doc. Definitely rectal. Look, I’m not a delicate flower, okay? I know where things are. It’s… it’s in the stool. And sometimes, just… blood. Not like a cut, more like… well, you know. It’s enough to turn the water pink, alright? And it stinks. Real bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying, Mr. Gentz. Blood in the stool, especially enough to change the water color, is something we need to investigate. And the odor is also helpful information. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the stool itself?
PATIENT: What do you mean? It's… poop, Doc. Brown, usually. Sometimes… darker. When the blood’s in it. Look, I eat normal. Not fancy, but I don't live on rabbit food. And I go regular, too. Every day, more or less. No trouble pushing, no pain or anything. It just… shows up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No pain or difficulty passing stool is good to know. The darker stool when there's blood present suggests it might be higher up in the digestive tract, but we can’t be sure yet. When you say “shows up”, did this start suddenly, or was it a gradual change?
PATIENT: Suddenly. Like a switch flipped. Two days ago, everything was fine. Normal. Then bam. First time, I thought it was something I ate. You know, beets or something. But then it happened again. And again. Not a little spot, either. Enough to make a fella nervous, alright? I haven’t been feeling weak, but… it's unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz. Sudden onset of rectal bleeding is definitely something we need to take seriously. It's good you haven't noticed any weakness, but we still need to find the source of the bleeding. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or any abdominal pain along with this?
PATIENT: Appetite’s fine. Always hungry, if I'm honest. Never been much of a small eater. And no pain, like you asked. Not a cramp, not a dull ache, nothing. Just… the blood. It’s just… there. Look, Doc, I’m a practical man. Is this something serious? Are we talkin’ surgery or… what?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. No abdominal pain is good. It's difficult to say definitively at this point without a proper examination, Mr. Gentz. There are several possibilities, ranging from relatively minor issues like hemorrhoids or anal fissures to more serious conditions. It could be something higher up in the digestive tract as well, which is why we need to investigate. I’m going to need to perform a physical exam, including a rectal exam, to get a better idea of what’s going on. This will allow me to check for any visible sources of bleeding and assess the area. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A… a what now? Look, Doc, I appreciate you tryin’ to be thorough, but… a finger up my… no. Absolutely not. Isn't there another way? Can’t you just give me something to stop the bleeding? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Gentz, and I wouldn't suggest anything that isn't necessary. However, a digital rectal exam is a crucial part of evaluating rectal bleeding. It allows me to physically assess the rectum and look for potential sources of bleeding that I simply can’t see otherwise. It’s a quick examination, and I'll do everything I can to make you comfortable. While I can't definitively diagnose the cause without it, and medication might temporarily stop the bleeding, it won't address the underlying problem. We need to find out why you're bleeding to ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. I can explain the procedure in more detail if you'd like. And again, I'll be as gentle and efficient as possible. If you absolutely refuse, we can discuss other options, but they would likely involve more extensive and potentially invasive testing, like a colonoscopy, without knowing where to focus our efforts. Would you be open to letting me explain the exam process?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now you’re talkin’ serious trouble. Look, Doc, I’m not made of money. And frankly, the thought of… whatever they do in there… it ain't appealing. Alright. Fine. But you better be gentle. And fast. And explain everything before you do it. I don't like surprises. What exactly are you lookin’ for? And how… how far does that finger go?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate you being willing to proceed with the exam. I will absolutely explain everything beforehand and be as gentle and efficient as possible. The purpose of the digital rectal exam is to check for abnormalities like hemorrhoids, anal fissures , or any masses or growths. I’ll also be assessing for blood or tenderness. As for how far the finger goes… it’s not as far as you might think. I’ll only need to insert a gloved, lubricated finger about an inch or two into the rectum. It should not cause significant discomfort, but you may feel some pressure. I'll be checking the walls of the lower rectum and the anal canal. Before we begin, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Do you have any history of constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Constipation? No, never. Always been regular, like I said. Diarrhea, sometimes. When I travel, mostly. Bad food, you know? Nothing serious. Usually clears up on its own. Never been to the hospital for it, or anything like that. I just… ride it out. Look, Doc, can we just get this over with? This talkin’ ain’t makin’ me any more comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No chronic constipation or severe diarrhea is good. And I understand your discomfort, Mr. Gentz. Let’s proceed with the exam. I’m going to ask you to lie on your left side with your knees bent. I'll explain each step as I go. This will only take a few moments. Do you have any other questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Just… hurry. And be careful. That’s all. And tell me if you see anything… bad. I’d rather know. Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. As I mentioned, I'm going to ask you to lie on your left side with your knees bent. I’ll be using a lubricated finger to gently examine the rectum and anal canal. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. I'll be looking for any abnormalities like hemorrhoids, fissures, or masses. I'll also check for blood or tenderness. Okay, I'm gently inserting my finger now… I’m noting some external hemorrhoids, they appear to be relatively small… No significant tenderness… I'm able to palpate the anal canal – it feels smooth… I am detecting some blood on my gloved finger… It appears to be coming from within the rectum, not just around the anus… The stool is also positive for occult blood... Okay, that's all for now. It was a quick exam.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Don't beat around the bush. Is it serious? Is it… cancer?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand your anxiety. I'm going to be direct with you. I did find some external hemorrhoids, which are a common cause of rectal bleeding, but they don't fully explain the amount of bleeding you described. More concerningly, I detected blood both on my gloved finger and in the stool sample – this is what we call occult blood. The presence of occult blood indicates bleeding somewhere higher up in the digestive tract, which could be caused by several things, ranging from ulcers or polyps to more serious conditions. While it doesn't necessarily mean it's cancer, it's something we need to investigate further. Based on my examination, I recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. I know you're apprehensive about it, but it’s the most effective way to get a definitive diagnosis. Would you be willing to discuss the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… just what I needed. Look, Doc, I ain't got insurance. You think that thing costs a fortune. And what if you find somethin’… bad? What then? More tests? More money? I'm a widower, alright? I’m livin’ on a fixed income. This is… this is a bad time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz, and I sincerely apologize for the difficult news. You're right to be concerned about the cost, and I want to assure you that we can discuss options to make it more affordable. Many hospitals offer financial assistance programs or payment plans for patients without insurance. We can also look into free or reduced-cost clinics in the area. As for what if we find something serious, it's best to address it proactively. If we identify a polyp or other abnormality, early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. We can discuss all available options, including less invasive procedures if appropriate. I can refer you to a gastroenterologist who can explain the risks and benefits of each treatment in detail. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s focus on getting the colonoscopy scheduled. I will have my nurse provide you with information on financial assistance programs and local clinics. Would you like me to proceed with the referral to a gastroenterologist?
PATIENT: …Alright. Fine. Do what you gotta do. Referral… yeah. Do the referral. But… don’t just send me to anyone. Someone… someone who explains things. Someone who won’t just treat me like a number. And get me that information about… the money. Don’t want to end up bankrupt over this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I completely understand. I will personally recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance – she’s an excellent gastroenterologist known for her compassionate care and clear explanations. She’s very thorough and takes the time to answer all of her patients' questions. I'll have my nurse forward her contact information, along with the information on financial assistance programs and local clinics, to you immediately. I want to reassure you that we'll work through this together. I'll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results of the colonoscopy and address any concerns you may have. In the meantime, if you experience any significant bleeding, abdominal pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just… get that information to me. And thank you… I guess. Even though it ain’t good news.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gentz. I understand it's not the news you wanted to hear, and I want you to know I'm here to support you every step of the way. My nurse will be with you shortly to provide the information. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in two weeks. .
