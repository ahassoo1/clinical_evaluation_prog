DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. Like it just stays in there. It’s been going on for a little bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having some difficulty completely emptying your bladder. And you said this has been going on for a little while... could you tell me a bit more about how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little bit slow. But it’s gotten worse lately. I have to… strain a little more, and sometimes… sometimes it just stops.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradually worsening over the past three to four months. You're straining to urinate, and sometimes it cuts off mid-stream. Do you feel like you're unable to get any urine out at times, or just that it doesn’t all come out at once?
PATIENT: No, no, it always comes out. Just… not all of it, all at once. Like there’s always a little bit left in there, even after I try. It feels… full, even when I thought I emptied it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you feel like you're not fully emptying your bladder, and you have a sensation of fullness even after you've tried to urinate. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other changes – any urgency, frequency, or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Urgency… yes, sometimes. I gotta go pretty quick when I feel it. Not always, but more often now than before. No pain, though. Not when I go, and not after. It’s just… the fullness, and not getting it all out. Frequency… maybe a little more often, but I haven’t really kept track, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re experiencing some urgency, and possibly slightly increased frequency. No pain, which is good. And the main issue is still the feeling of incomplete emptying. Now, have you noticed any change in the strength of your stream – is it weaker than usual, or does it come out with the same force?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… I think it might be a little weaker. Not a lot, but… yes. It’s not like a strong push anymore, like it used to be. More of a… a trickle, sometimes. It’s hard to explain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. A weaker stream and incomplete emptying. And you mentioned it started a few months ago. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes or prostate problems – that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. My wife… she used to take care of all that. She passed away last year… so, I haven't really kept up with it. I don’t think I have diabetes, though. I don’t feel sick like that. And… I don’t think men get prostate problems, do they? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Dondre. It's understandable that things have slipped your mind. And yes, men can have prostate problems, though not all do. It’s something we’ll want to consider. Now, before we go further, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I don’t take anything. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just a little bit of fish oil sometimes, for my joints. But that’s all. Nothing regular, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional fish oil. And you mentioned no allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. We’ll just check your abdomen, and I’ll also need to do a quick neurological exam. And I'll need to check a prostate exam as well. That will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: A prostate exam…? Well… I haven’t had one of those before. Is it… necessary, Doctor? It sounds a little… unpleasant. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dondre. It's not the most comfortable exam, but it's an important part of evaluating the possible causes of your symptoms. It allows me to check the size and consistency of your prostate. It helps us rule things out and figure out what’s going on. We can take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It's relatively quick. If you're really uncomfortable, we can discuss other options, but it would delay getting to a diagnosis. Would you like to proceed with the exam?
PATIENT: …Alright. If it’s necessary, I suppose. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. And tell me what you’re doing, okay? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything as I go, and we'll go as slow as you need. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, if you could just lie down on your side, with your knees bent… We'll start by feeling your abdomen. I’m just checking for any tenderness or fullness. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not yet. Just feels… like a doctor’s exam, I suppose. A little cold, but not painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathing normally, please. Everything sounds normal there. Now, we’ll move on to the prostate exam. I will use a lubricated finger to gently check the size and feel of your prostate through your rectum. I know it’s not comfortable, and I’ll explain each step as I go. Are you ready?
PATIENT: …I think so. Just… hurry, please. And tell me what you’re doing, like you said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre, I’m just gently inserting my finger. I'm feeling for the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate. You might feel some pressure. I'm noting some slight enlargement of your prostate. It feels smooth, but a bit larger than I would expect. No obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. Okay, all done. I’ll be right back to clean up and discuss my findings with you.
PATIENT: …Alright. That wasn’t as bad as I thought, but I’m glad it’s over. Enlarged, you say…? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. So, enlargement of the prostate is common as men age. It’s often due to a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It means the prostate is getting larger, which can press on the urethra, making it difficult to urinate. That explains some of the symptoms you’re experiencing – the straining, the incomplete emptying, the weaker stream. However, enlargement can also be caused by other things, so we need to rule those out. To do that, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The urine analysis will check for infection, and the PSA test measures a protein produced by the prostate. It can help us assess the risk of prostate cancer. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: …Cancer…? Oh dear. That’s… that’s worrying. You think it could be cancer? I don’t want cancer. A urine test and a blood test… alright. That I can do. But you’ll let me know right away if it’s anything bad, won’t you, Doctor? Don’t keep me waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Dondre. It's natural to be concerned. But it's important to remember that most men with an enlarged prostate do not have cancer. The PSA test is just a screening tool, and a lot of things can affect its level. We won’t know anything for sure until we get the results and discuss them. I promise to let you know as soon as the results are available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to go over everything in detail. We’ll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral to a urologist. They are specialists in the urinary system and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A specialist… alright. That sounds… sensible. Someone who knows more about it. Yes, that’s good. And you’ll call me with the test results, and schedule the appointment with… the urologist? Is that right? And it won’t be too long, will it? I don’t want to wait weeks and weeks… my nerves are already bad enough.
DOCTOR: Yes, I will call you with the test results as soon as they come in – I anticipate it will be within a few days. And I’ll schedule an appointment with the urologist for you right away. I’ll try to get you in as quickly as possible. I'll make a note in your chart to prioritize it. I understand your anxiety, and I want to get this sorted out as soon as we can. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. I know that's easier said than done, but try to focus on things you enjoy. Are there any questions I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: …No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… please, call me as soon as you get the results. And thank you… for being so patient with me. It’s been a stressful day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. It’s my job to help, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns before I call. Here's a copy of the referral to the urologist and the lab request for the tests. Take care of yourself, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
