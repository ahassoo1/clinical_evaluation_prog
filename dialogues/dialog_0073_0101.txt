DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, I’ve been getting this headache, right at the back of my head. It’s been happening on and off for a couple weeks now. Not the worst pain, but enough to bother a fella.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. A headache, you say. For about two weeks. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like a throbbing headache, more of a… a constant pressure, you know? Like someone's got a hand pressing on the back of my skull. It doesn't really shoot or anything, just… there. Sometimes it feels a bit tight in my neck too, around the same area. It’s worse when I'm trying to concentrate, like when I'm doing nails. Makes it hard to be precise.
DOCTOR: Constant pressure at the back of the head, sometimes with neck tightness… and it interferes with your… nail work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. I’m a manicurist, you see. Been doing it for… well, a long time now. Needs a steady hand, and this headache makes it shaky sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to be worrying. And my wife keeps telling me to get it checked out. She's a sensible woman, my Elsie.
DOCTOR: I see. A steady hand is certainly important for your profession. And it's good of Elsie to encourage you to come in. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Changed? Not really, not much. Elsie and I haven’t been traveling like we used to, just stayin’ close to home. I’m still doin’ nails, same hours, same clients mostly. Oh… I did try a new cushion for my chair a couple weeks back. Could that be somethin’? It was supposed to be more supportive, but maybe it wasn’t the right fit.
DOCTOR: A new cushion… interesting. And you started using it around the same time as the headaches began?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right! About two weeks ago, give or take. It felt good at first, but then... well, then the headaches started. Maybe it's throwin' my back out of alignment or somethin'? I don’t know nothin’ about those things. Elsie says I sit like a question mark anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's possible the cushion is contributing. Now, aside from the headaches and the neck tightness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea or anything like that. Just the headache and a little stiffness in my neck sometimes. Appetite's been fine, sleepin' alright, regular as clockwork. Elsie says I snore a bit, but she's always said that! Nothing major, you understand. Just this nagging headache.
DOCTOR: No other symptoms... that's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask some general questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Had a bit of the flu here and there, usual things, but never been seriously ill. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but it's been under control with… well, with watchin' my salt intake, mostly. Elsie makes sure of that. Otherwise, no, nothin’ major. Used to be a strong swimmer, but that was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with diet. Good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always avoided 'em if I could. Elsie's brother had a bad time with one, years ago. Put me off for life, it did. I believe in lettin' the body heal itself, if possible. Bit old-fashioned, I suppose, but that’s how I was raised.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, Elsie's mother had arthritis, bad in her hands. That's why Elsie worries about me, I think - seeing her mother struggle. My own mother… she lived to a good age, but I don’t recall her having any serious ailments. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, like myself. No history of headaches or nothin' like that, as far as I know. We didn’t talk much about those things back then.
DOCTOR: No family history of headaches. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, Doctor. Small white ones. I take one every morning with my breakfast. Elsie makes sure I don't miss a dose. And occasionally, if my joints are achin' a bit, I'll take a little ibuprofen, but not very often. Hardly ever, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. My Elsie always says I’m a bit of a baby when it comes to needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Mr. Popova, I assure you. Just a few simple checks. Please, have a seat here and let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs… Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. No obvious weakness or numbness. Palpating the muscles in your neck… there is some tenderness here, particularly on the left side. Alright, Mr. Popova. Everything seems fairly normal, but the tenderness in your neck is notable.
PATIENT: Hmm… that left side, you say? That’s where I mostly feel the tension. Makes sense, I suppose. It feels like a knot sometimes, right at the base of my skull. Elsie tries to rub it out, but it doesn’t always help. She's got good intentions, bless her. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Popova, given your history and the findings of the exam, it sounds most likely to be tension headache, possibly with some muscle strain in your neck. The new cushion could certainly be a contributing factor, causing you to hold your neck in an awkward position. The diminished reflexes are typical for your age. While it's not serious in the sense of a life-threatening condition, it's clearly affecting your quality of life, and that's something we need to address. I don’t think we need any imaging at this time. Now, I recommend we start with some conservative measures…
PATIENT: Conservative measures… that sounds good, Doctor. I don’t want no fancy tests if we can avoid ‘em. What kind of measures are we talkin’ about? And do you think I should get rid of that cushion? Elsie will be upset, she just bought it. She’s a woman of strong opinions, is Elsie.
DOCTOR: Alright. Firstly, yes, I’d recommend removing the new cushion for a while and seeing if that improves things. Explain to Elsie that it's a trial period – if it doesn't help, you can always revisit it. We can also try some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. But don't take them for extended periods. More importantly, I’d suggest some gentle neck stretches and exercises. I can give you a handout with some examples. Also, maintaining good posture is crucial, especially when you're doing nails. And if the pain persists, we might consider a referral to a physical therapist. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I can explain to Elsie about the cushion - she's usually understanding, once she sees the logic of things. And some stretches and exercises... I suppose I can manage that. A handout would be helpful, my memory isn't what it used to be. And good posture... that’s somethin’ I should probably work on. I tend to hunch over when I'm concentrating. So, stretches, posture, and maybe some ibuprofen if needed. Anything else?
DOCTOR: Here's a handout with some gentle neck stretches and exercises. Remember, start slowly and don’t push yourself. If you experience any pain, stop immediately. As for the ibuprofen, limit it to a few days at a time. And if the pain isn’t improving within a week or two, or if it gets worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We may then need to consider that physical therapy referral. I’m not overly concerned at this point, but we want to ensure we address this effectively. Do you have any questions for me about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. That’s very thorough, thank you. Elsie will be happy to hear you're not overly concerned. She worries about me somethin’ fierce. I’ll give the stretches a try, and I'll keep an eye on it. And I'll make sure to schedule a follow-up if things don’t improve. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Korrell. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. Remember to listen to your body and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I’m glad I could help. Here’s a summary of our visit, just for your records. Take care, and hopefully, we'll see some improvement soon. Have a good day, Mr. Popova.
PATIENT: .
