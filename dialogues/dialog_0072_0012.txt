DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you too. I am here because I am going on a cruise next month – a rather lovely one, actually, around the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information from my doctor before I can travel. It’s just a formality, I believe, but a necessary one.
DOCTOR: I see. A Mediterranean cruise – sounds delightful. And you’re correct, many cruise lines do require a physician’s note to ensure passengers are fit for travel. We’ll certainly get that taken care of for you. To begin, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m generally quite well, thank you. I don't get sick often. I’ve always been a fairly strong woman, you see. I keep active with my work – it involves a good bit of lifting and arranging, you know, displaying merchandise and trimming windows. It keeps me on my feet. I lost my husband a few years back, and that was a difficult time, naturally, but I’ve managed to keep myself busy and healthy since then. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear that you've been able to stay active despite everything, Ms. Squiers. It's important. Let's delve a little deeper, just to be thorough. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. My blood pressure has been a little high at times when the nurse checks it at the chemist, but she says it's usually just because I’m a bit flustered when she takes it. Nothing a cup of tea and a sit down can’t fix, usually. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a touch of arthritis in his knees towards the end, but it never affected me, thankfully. I really do try to look after myself.
DOCTOR: Very good. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a child – a very common thing, back then, I believe – and I broke my arm once when I was younger, climbing a tree, rather foolishly, I admit. But nothing since. No hospital stays, no major surgeries. I've always been lucky, I suppose. A few stitches here and there, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes—anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, bless her, she lived to a good age, but she had some trouble with her heart towards the end. Not a strong heart, the doctor said. My father, he was quite a robust man, but he did have a touch of the diabetes later in life. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she was sadly diagnosed with breast cancer, many years ago now. I believe that’s about all that I can readily recall. It wasn’t something we discussed often, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I don’t take anything regularly. If I get a headache, I might take a paracetamol now and then, but that’s about it. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, as it’s often rather gloomy here. But nothing else. I prefer to avoid medication if I can, honestly. I believe in a good diet and fresh air, that’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex… anything at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, to my knowledge. I eat most things, and I’ve never had any trouble with latex gloves at the chemist or anything like that. I do have rather sensitive skin, and sometimes it gets a bit irritated by certain soaps, but it’s not a true allergy, just a bit of a reaction. I consider myself quite fortunate in that regard, really.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, as I mentioned, I am widowed. My husband and I had a lovely life together. I don’t have any children. I live alone in a small flat, just a short walk from the town centre. I keep myself busy with my work, and I have a few close friends I meet with regularly for tea and a chat. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of sherry on special occasions. Is that the sort of thing you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s sufficient. Now, Ms. Squiers, you mentioned that you’re going on a cruise next month. Are you experiencing any current symptoms or health concerns that prompted you to seek this medical evaluation beyond the cruise line’s requirement?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I feel perfectly well. I’m very fit for my age, honestly. I just thought it would be sensible to have a quick check-up before going on such a long journey. It’s a long cruise, and I wouldn’t want to be caught out with anything unexpected. It’s simply a precaution, you understand. I wouldn't want to be a bother to the ship's doctor, now would I?
DOCTOR: Very well. Although you report feeling well, a basic physical exam is still prudent given the length and nature of your upcoming travel. Would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs, checked your blood pressure, and briefly examined your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. A quick check is always a good idea. I wouldn’t want to leave any stone unturned. Please, proceed when you are ready. I’m quite happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92. We'll monitor that. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. No masses palpated. Overall, your physical exam is largely unremarkable, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further investigation after your cruise. I suggest a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician upon your return.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A murmur, you say? I've never been told I had a murmur before. Is it anything serious, Doctor? And the blood pressure… I do get a bit anxious at the chemist, you know. Is it something I should be particularly worried about? I’m not normally one to fuss, but a murmur does sound a bit… alarming. Perhaps it’s just a temporary thing?
DOCTOR: It is not necessarily alarming, Ms. Squiers, but it warrants a follow-up. Many murmurs are benign, innocent flow murmurs, however, it’s essential to rule out any underlying cardiac pathology. As for your blood pressure, it is elevated, and while anxiety can certainly contribute, it's something we need to address. I will document these findings and recommend a complete cardiac workup with an echocardiogram and an ambulatory blood pressure monitor upon your return. Do you have a primary care physician I can send these results to?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. A cardiac workup… Well, I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since my husband passed, to be honest. He always took care of those things. I suppose I should have gotten around to it sooner. No, I don’t have a primary care physician at the moment. Would you be able to recommend someone, Doctor? Perhaps someone nearby? I wouldn’t want to have to travel too far. And is this something I should worry about during the cruise? Should I limit my activity, or…
DOCTOR: I can provide you with a list of physicians in the area. However, I must advise that it is your responsibility to establish care with a provider. As for your concerns during the cruise, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. Should you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations, seek immediate medical attention from the ship’s doctor. I will document these recommendations, and prepare a summary of your visit for your records. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. No strenuous activity, and to seek medical attention if I experience any of those symptoms. It's just… a little unsettling, to be told all this right before a long journey. But I appreciate you being thorough. Perhaps I’m worrying unnecessarily. I am generally a very healthy woman, after all. Thank you for your time, Doctor, and for the recommendations. I will certainly look into finding a primary care physician upon my return. And I’ll be sure to take it easy on the cruise. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Perhaps a leaflet about heart murmurs, or…
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your concerns, Ms. Squiers, I do not typically provide informational pamphlets. I have documented my findings and recommendations, and those are the most important thing. I will have the summary of your visit printed for you now. It is imperative that you schedule a follow-up appointment with a physician as soon as possible upon your return. Do you have any further questions before I finalize this report?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you again for your time, and for the thorough examination. I understand the importance of a follow-up appointment, and I assure you I will make that a priority upon my return. I do hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant cruise, Ms. Squiers. And please, prioritize your health upon your return. .
