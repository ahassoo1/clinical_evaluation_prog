DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. It’s my stool. It’s… dark. Black, really. And I take pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. I figured it had something to do with that, but my niece said I should come get it checked. She worries too much, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: Black stool, you say. And you're taking red pills for arthritis… alright. Years, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, years. Since before you were probably even born, dear. They help, mostly. But, like I said, this stool… it's not right. It started a couple of days ago, maybe three. I haven't changed anything else, nothing in my diet. Just the pills. And worrying, thanks to my niece.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, black stool can be from a number of things, and it’s good you’re getting it checked, even if your niece is a bit…overzealous. It often indicates something going on higher up in the digestive tract, and those arthritis pills… some medications can cause this as a side effect, yes. But we can’t assume. Let's get a little more detail. Have you noticed any change in the consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Consistency? Goodness. What do you want me to say? It’s… stool. It’s usually… solid. Sometimes a little soft, depends what I ate. But not watery, never watery. Just… dark. Like coffee grounds, almost. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don’t spend my days analyzing my… waste.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dawnetta. You don't need to give a detailed analysis. "Like coffee grounds" is actually quite helpful, thank you. And no blood in it, correct?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. No blood. Just… dark and a bit grainy, like I said. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? It's probably just the pills. My husband always says doctors just like to poke and prod and make a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, your husband isn’t a medical professional, is he?
PATIENT: No, he’s a retired carpenter. A very good carpenter, I might add. Built our entire house himself. Point is, he's practical. He doesn’t believe in making mountains out of molehills. And frankly, neither do I. I just want to know if I need a special stool softener or something. This is all very… disruptive.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your husband’s carpentry skills, Dawnetta, this isn’t about molehills. Black, tarry stools – and you’ve described it very specifically as grainy, like coffee grounds – are often a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract. It’s possible it’s the medication, but we need to rule out more serious causes. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, and then I'll order some blood work. It’s standard procedure. And I strongly advise we do a fecal occult blood test as well.
PATIENT: A fecal what now? Look, I really don’t appreciate you talking down to me. I’ve lived 73 years and I’ve never had to deal with this kind of fuss. I take a pill, my stool changes color, and suddenly I need poked and prodded and… tested? I told you, it’s probably the pills. Can’t we just try something for the stool? A simple remedy? I don't have time for all these tests.
DOCTOR: Dawnetta, I am not talking down to you. I am explaining that we need to be thorough. A "simple remedy" could mask a serious problem. We need to determine the cause of the bleeding, not just treat the symptom. The fecal occult blood test – it’s a simple test to check for hidden blood in your stool. It's non-invasive. And frankly, dismissing it as "just the pills" is irresponsible. I’m ordering the blood work and the fecal occult blood test. We’ll discuss the results, and then we can decide on a course of action. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, I’m allergic to nonsense, mostly. And impatient doctors. But, fine. No known drug allergies, no food allergies… I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. And I still think this is a waste of my time. But do what you have to do. Just… please be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll palpate it gently to check for any tenderness. It won't take long. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. And try not to poke too hard. My husband will be furious if I'm bruised.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is soft, no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though slightly hypoactive. No palpable masses. Your abdomen doesn’t feel particularly tender to the touch, which is good. But we still need those lab results to be certain. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a stool occult blood test, as we discussed. I'll also add a liver function test, just to be thorough. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… when will I get the results? I have a garden club meeting on Thursday. I can’t spend the whole week worrying about this. And frankly, I doubt anything will come of it. It's probably just the pills.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24-48 hours, so you should have them by Wednesday at the latest. The nurse will let you know when they’re available. And while I understand your skepticism, Dawnetta, it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’m doing what’s necessary to ensure your health. We’ll discuss the results then, and if everything comes back normal, we can reassess the situation. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. Just… get me out of here.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. Have a good day, Dawnetta. .
