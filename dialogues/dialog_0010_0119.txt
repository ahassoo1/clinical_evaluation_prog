DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a delicate matter, really. I’m not entirely comfortable discussing this, but… there’s a discharge. A problem with my… companion. He’s a bit older, you understand, and things aren't quite what they used to be. It’s rather embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. It is often difficult to discuss these things, and you’ve come to the right place. We handle all sorts of concerns here with discretion and respect. When you say "companion," are you referring to a pet?
PATIENT: A pet? Goodness, no! Though I suppose some people do treat their animals like… well, never mind. No, Doctor, he is a gentleman friend. A very… close gentleman friend. I simply didn’t think it was appropriate to announce such things so bluntly. Is that… unusual?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Wartick. Thank you for clarifying. I apologize for the initial misunderstanding. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable. So, this “discharge” you mentioned – can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's… it's yellowish, mostly. And there’s an odor. Not a pleasant odor, I assure you. It appears after… after we’ve been… close. It's quite worrying, you see. He's been a bit… subdued lately, and I fear this is the cause. He doesn’t complain, of course, he’s a gentleman. But I notice things. Do you see what I mean? It's terribly distressing.
DOCTOR: I do, Ms. Wartick. And I appreciate you sharing this with me, despite your discomfort. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. It’s been… perhaps three weeks? Maybe a month. It's difficult to be precise, I don't spend my days monitoring such things, you understand. It started gradually, just a little dampness, and then it became… more noticeable. He hasn’t been himself since, a bit lethargic, you see. And I’ve been trying to keep things… tidy, but it's rather awkward.
DOCTOR: Three to four weeks. Alright. And has there been any pain associated with this, for either of you?
PATIENT: Pain? Goodness, no! He’s a gentleman, Doctor, not some… barbarian. He wouldn’t complain about pain. I certainly haven’t noticed any, though he may be… stoic about it. It’s more a matter of his general demeanor, a certain… listlessness. I’m quite concerned about his well-being, you see. This is very unlike him.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like you’re very attentive to his needs. Just to clarify, when you say “listlessness,” is he eating and drinking normally?
PATIENT: Well, his appetite hasn't been quite the same. He used to adore his biscuits, you see, practically inhale them. But lately, he’s been… picking at them. And his water bowl isn't emptied as quickly. He still drinks, of course, but not with his usual enthusiasm. It’s a small thing, perhaps, but it’s concerning nonetheless. He’s a creature of habit, you understand. Any deviation from the norm worries me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has he had any changes in his bowel movements?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! Must we discuss everything? I came here about a discharge, not… that! It’s terribly inappropriate. He’s a respectable companion, not some… common animal! I will not delve into such indelicate details. Is there nothing you can do about the discharge without interrogating me about his… personal habits?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Wartick. You are absolutely right, that was inappropriate of me. I am simply trying to gather all the necessary information, and I allow my medical training to sometimes… overstep boundaries. Let’s return to the discharge. Has he been grooming himself more or less than usual?
PATIENT: Well, now, that’s a reasonable question. He has been rather preoccupied with himself lately, you see. More… meticulous, shall we say, in his grooming habits. Spending an inordinate amount of time… tidying up. It’s almost obsessive, really. He used to be a bit… rough and tumble, but now he’s constantly preening. It’s quite peculiar. Could that be… related to the problem?
DOCTOR: It could be. Ms. Wartick, I’m going to ask a slightly more direct question, and please feel free to tell me if you’re uncomfortable. Is your companion neutered?
PATIENT: Doctor! Are you suggesting… something untoward? He is a gentleman, a refined gentleman! Such a question is simply… beyond the pale! I won’t stand for it. I think I’d like a second opinion. This is outrageous! .
