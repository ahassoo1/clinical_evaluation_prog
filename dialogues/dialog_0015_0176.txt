DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. It's been over two days now, and it’s getting really annoying.
DOCTOR: Two days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, started sometime on the first, I think. Maybe late afternoon? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, honestly. I was trying to ignore it at first, hoping it would just go away, but it hasn’t. It's pretty constant, though sometimes they're a little further apart.
DOCTOR: Constant hiccups for two days is…unusual. Have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, you name it! Holding my breath, drinking water really fast, getting someone to scare me…my neighbor tried that one, didn’t work. And I even tried a spoonful of sugar. Nothing seems to touch them. It's just…hic…still going.
DOCTOR: Those are…common remedies, yes. Alright. Let's get a bit more detail. Can you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they feel…normal, I guess? Like regular hiccups. Not painful, just…a jerk of the diaphragm. They happen pretty randomly. I can be talking, or just sitting, or hic even walking. It doesn't seem to matter. They're not getting worse, but they aren’t getting better either, which is the frustrating part.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I’m a little tired, but that’s probably just from not sleeping well with them keeping me up. And my stomach feels a bit…funny sometimes. Not exactly pain, more like a gurgling feeling. But I don’t think that’s connected, I get that sometimes anyway. hic Honestly, it’s mostly just the hiccups. They’re really disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen. Just lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. hic Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I hope you can figure out what’s going on. It’s really starting to drive me crazy.
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Slightly distended, but not significantly.
PATIENT: Is that good or bad? I don’t really understand all that medical stuff. hic Distended…what does that mean? Is my stomach big or something?
DOCTOR: "Distended" simply means your abdomen is a bit…fuller than usual. It's not dramatically so, but noticeable. The examination didn't reveal anything acutely concerning. Given the duration and lack of other symptoms, it's unlikely to be a serious underlying issue, but persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate a problem. Have you had any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Mostly Egyptian food, you know – koshari, ful medames, things like that. hic I haven’t tried anything new lately. Maybe a little more sweets than usual, but that’s just because it’s summer and the mangoes are so good. I don’t think that would cause hiccups, would it?
DOCTOR: While a sudden increase in sugar intake is not a common cause of persistent hiccups, it's certainly not impossible. And it does contribute to…other health concerns. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to avoid them if I can. I had some blood pressure medication a few years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. hic And sometimes I take something for headaches, but not very often. Just over-the-counter stuff, ibuprofen or something. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. hic I eat a lot of different foods, and I haven't had any problems. I used to worry about shellfish, but I've had it plenty of times with no issues.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the lack of other symptoms, no medication use, and unremarkable examination, it's likely these hiccups are idiopathic – meaning we don't know the exact cause. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of more serious underlying conditions, especially given the duration. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any obvious issues. We should also check your magnesium level.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? hic Is something wrong with my chest? That sounds…scary. And a panel? What will that show? Is this going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: It's a precautionary measure, Ms. Redeye. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's better to be thorough. The chest X-ray will look at your lungs and heart to make sure there isn't anything causing the hiccups. The basic metabolic panel will check your electrolytes and kidney function. As for cost… I'm aware you're uninsured. We can discuss a payment plan with the billing department. And frankly, waiting and hoping won't resolve a case of hiccups this long-standing. We need to investigate the cause. It's also possible a referral to a gastroenterologist may be necessary. Do you consent to the chest X-ray and blood work?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, okay. hic If you think it’s necessary. I don’t want anything serious going on. And I guess blood work is better than…just hiccupping forever. Yes, I consent. But please, explain everything clearly if you find anything. And could you really talk to the billing department for me? I’m terrible at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll write the orders for the X-ray and blood work now. The radiology technician will explain the X-ray procedure, and a phlebotomist will draw your blood. I'll review the results as soon as they're available. I'll also have the billing department contact you regarding payment options. Now, let me give you a referral slip to a gastroenterologist, just in case we don't find anything definitive with the initial tests. It’s better to be prepared. Here are the lab orders, the radiology request, and the referral. The lab is across the hall, and radiology is on the third floor. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Third floor… hic That’s a lot of stairs. Okay. No, I don’t think so. Just…thank you, Doctor. I really hope you can figure this out. It’s just so…tiring. And embarrassing. People keep staring when I hiccup. .
