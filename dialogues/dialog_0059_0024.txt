DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s a bit of a strange request, actually. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for… travel insurance, mostly. I lost my husband last year, and I'm finally trying to get back to… things. They need a doctor’s note.
DOCTOR: I understand, Kiante. I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. It takes courage to start getting back to things, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. A “fit to fly” letter, certainly. To do that properly, I’ll need to ask a few questions to get a good understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need. I don’t… I don’t have any major health problems, if that helps. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose. And, well, grief. But nothing a doctor would need to worry about, probably.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you don’t have any major concerns, but even “usual aches and pains” are important to consider. And please don’t minimize the impact of grief – it can absolutely affect your physical health. We’ll take everything into account. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been diagnosed with anything, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but I haven’t been seriously sick since I was a kid, honestly. I’ve always been pretty healthy. Oh, wait. I had pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. It wasn't severe.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia ten years ago. And a full recovery, that’s good to know. Do you recall if that was treated with antibiotics, and if you needed to be hospitalized?
PATIENT: Yes, I definitely needed antibiotics. A strong course of them. And yes, I was hospitalized. Just for a few days, though. I was running a really high fever and they wanted to keep an eye on me. They said it was a bad strain of pneumonia. I remember being very weak for a few weeks afterwards. But, again, fully recovered. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, pneumonia ten years ago, treated with antibiotics and requiring a brief hospitalization. We’ll make a note of that. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any. I've been very lucky, I think. I haven't even broken a bone! My husband, on the other hand... he was always getting into scrapes. He broke his arm twice, I remember. But me? Nothing.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. No surgeries is certainly a good thing. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. She managed it with medication for years. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had… something with his heart. I don't remember the specifics, I was very young. He passed away when I was a teenager. Nothing else really stands out, to be honest. My family was generally pretty healthy. Oh! My aunt had asthma, but that’s not… serious, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful information. High blood pressure in your mother, heart condition in your grandfather, and asthma in your aunt. We’ll note all of that. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don’t take anything. I try to eat well and get enough sleep, that’s it. I don’t even really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Just… nothing. Honestly, the only thing I regularly take is… maybe a multivitamin sometimes, but it’s very infrequent.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Just occasional multivitamins. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… I'm pretty boring that way, I guess. No exciting sensitivities to report. It’s a bit… uneventful, isn’t it? All this “no this, no that”.
DOCTOR: It’s actually very good to hear, Kiante. A lack of allergies and medical issues is certainly a positive thing. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My husband used to smoke, but he quit years ago. I don't drink alcohol, either. It doesn't agree with me. And absolutely no drugs. I've always been very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Very good. Finally, before we proceed with a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little about your current health status?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I’ve been feeling generally well. Just… tired, sometimes. But I think that’s just the grief, honestly. It’s been a hard year. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… Nothing concerning like that. My appetite has been a bit off lately, but I’m trying to eat regular meals. Just… a bit drained, really. But I’m trying to get better. I really am. I want to get back to… living.
DOCTOR: I understand, Kiante. It’s completely understandable to feel drained after such a significant loss. It’s good that you’re focusing on getting better, and that’s a very positive step. Alright, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. It’s a very quick exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I… I guess I’m a bit anxious about this whole flying thing, so if you see anything concerning, please just let me know. I just want to make sure I’m okay to travel. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take things slowly. I’ll explain everything as I go. Your heart sounds regular and strong. No murmurs or unusual sounds. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Blood pressure is 128/82, which is within the normal range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Everything sounds good so far, Kiante. It’s all very preliminary, of course, but based on this brief exam, there’s no immediate reason to believe you wouldn’t be able to travel. Now, just to be thorough, and given the recent fatigue you've been experiencing, I’d like to order a basic blood test. It will check your red blood cell count, electrolytes, and kidney function. It’ll give us a bit more information, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I appreciate you being thorough. A blood test is fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to be sure. I really do. I'm… eager to get back to things, and I don’t want anything holding me back.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand completely. It's always best to be cautious, and I want you to feel confident and safe when you travel. I’ll have the lab technician draw a small sample of blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we can review them and I can write you a “fit to fly” letter. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. I appreciate your patience, and for not dismissing my… anxieties. It means a lot. I guess I just need to wait for the results now. Do I need to do anything special before the blood test? Like fast or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I understand it’s a bit unsettling, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Yes, for the most accurate results, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood test. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. Do you think that will be a problem?
PATIENT: No, no problem at all. I can easily do that. Eight hours isn't bad. I'll make sure to schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning, then. Is there anything else I need to know about the lab? Location, what to bring…? Or, if you have a preference, I could just come back another day?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here's the requisition form. The lab is located just down the hall, room 203. You'll need to bring your insurance card and a photo ID. You don’t need to schedule an appointment; it’s a walk-in clinic. Coming back another day is absolutely an option, but there’s no need if it's convenient for you to go tomorrow morning. It will likely be quicker to get the results back if you go sooner. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I really appreciate it. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow morning, then. I’ll let them know you sent me. I guess I'll see you again when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. We look forward to seeing you again when the results are back. Have a good evening, and please try to get some rest.
PATIENT: .
