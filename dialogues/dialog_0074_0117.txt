DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Devin Reyno. I... I got a cough. A bad one. And, uh... there's blood in it sometimes. Not a lot, but… yeah. Blood. I smoke, if that matters. Been smokin’ a long time. I just… want to get it checked out. Don't remember much else about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. Thank you for letting me know. A cough with blood, even a small amount, is definitely something we need to investigate. And yes, your smoking history is important information. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: More about it… uh… it’s… rough. Like, deep in my chest. Happens mostly in the mornin’. And like I said, not every time. Sometimes just…phlegm. But then other times… red. Not a lot, like a few streaks. It started… a while ago. Maybe a month? Hard to say. Things kinda blur together these days. Do you… need to know when exactly? I don't really keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Reyno. A general timeframe is helpful. So, roughly a month, and it’s worse in the mornings, with blood appearing occasionally. You mentioned it feels deep in your chest – is it painful when you cough?
PATIENT: Painful… not exactly painful. More… sore. Like a really bad ache after a hard day. And it kinda makes my chest feel tight. Like somethin’s squeezin’ it. Not all the time, just when I cough real hard. And… sometimes I get kinda dizzy when I’m coughin’ a lot. Not fallin’ down dizzy, just… lightheaded. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explainin’ things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Reyno. You're describing a cough with associated chest soreness, tightness, and some lightheadedness. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had a fever, chills, or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I just figured it was the weather. Chills… no. And weight loss… well, I ain’t exactly been gainin weight, but I don’t know if that’s… from the cough. I just kinda eat what I can, when I can. I mostly live alone, so cookin’ is… a hassle. Sorry, I’m probably not much help. I just wanna know if I'm gonna be okay.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Reyno. It's alright if you don't have precise answers; we'll gather as much information as we can. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… I think I had high blood pressure, a long time ago. The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped takin’ ‘em. Don’t remember why. Too many pills, I guess. And… I think my mom had somethin’ with her heart, but… I don’t know much about it. I mostly just try to ignore things until they get really bad. It’s kinda how I was raised. Is that… bad? Sorry. I’m ramblin’ again. Don’t remember much from doctor visits, honestly. They all kinda blend together. Medicare pays for somethin’, I think.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Reyno, you’re not rambling at all. It’s very common for things to blend together, and it’s perfectly understandable. Knowing about the history of high blood pressure is helpful, and that’s good information to have. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes after eatin’ shellfish, but that was a long time ago. Probably just somethin’ I ate. I mostly just eat simple stuff now. Not much room for fancy things when you live alone. I don't really take much besides… some ibuprofen for aches and pains. And… that’s about it. I think. Don’t remember bein’ allergic to nothin’. Honestly, I just try to avoid stuff that makes me feel sick. Is that a good answer? I'm tryin' to be helpful, I swear.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly good answer, Mr. Reyno. It’s good to know you haven’t experienced any significant allergic reactions. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Smokin’… yeah. Been smokin’ since I was… eighteen, maybe. Pack a day, most days. Used to be more, when I was workin’. Now… maybe half a pack. I try to cut back, but… it’s hard. It calms my nerves. I’ve been tryin’ to quit for years, but… I just can’t seem to stick with it. I’ve tried patches, gum… nothin’ works. It's a bad habit, I know. And probably what’s doin’ this to me. I just… don’t know how to stop. Sorry. I'm a mess, I guess. Is that what you wanted to know? How much I ruin my health?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, you are not a mess. Many people struggle with quitting smoking, and it takes a lot of courage to even try. It’s good that you’re aware of the risks, and we can talk about resources to help you quit if you're interested. Now, I would like to listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll also feel your chest to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with. I got things to do. I don't wanna be here all day. I just want to know if it's somethin' serious, and if I need to worry. Just… hurry, if you can. Sorry, I'm probably bein' rude. I just don't like doctors. Never have. I just wanna get this over with.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Reyno. I understand your hesitation. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… In… and out. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. And finally, I’m going to gently palpate your chest to check for any tenderness or masses. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. I'm going to order a chest x-ray and some blood work to help us get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… great. Just what I needed. More tests. Fine. Whatever. When will I get the results? I got appointments next week. And… I don’t want to be waitin’ around forever for this. Just… tell me if it’s bad, okay? Don’t sugarcoat it. I just want to know the truth. And… I guess that’s all. Can I go now? I really need to get goin’. Thanks… I think. Sorry if I’m bein’ difficult. I just… don’t like bein’ sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Reyno. I’ll do my best to expedite the results. The x-ray should be available within 24 hours, and the blood work usually takes a couple of days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as we have them. I promise I won’t sugarcoat anything. We'll discuss the findings honestly and develop a plan together. For now, I’m going to write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler to help with your breathing. It can provide some temporary relief while we wait for the results. And I'll also give you a referral to a pulmonary specialist for a comprehensive evaluation. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if your symptoms worsen or you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. You can go now, and we’ll be in touch soon. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Reyno. And please, don't apologize for being difficult. It's okay to feel anxious and want answers. .
