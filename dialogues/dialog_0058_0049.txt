DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Well, now… it’s me ears, I think. They ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Things are gettin’ a bit… muffled, ye know? Not a sharp pain or nothin’, just… hard to hear.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. “Muffled,” alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a tough one. Seems like a while now. Maybe… six months? A year? Time just kinda slips away when you get to be my age, ya know? I don’t rightly recall when it started bein’ this bad. It just… gradually got worse, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. “Gradually.” Okay. And is it both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Though… the left one’s probably a bit worse. It’s hard to say for sure. Sometimes I gotta really lean in to hear folks, and I mostly do it with that ear. It's just… everything sounds a bit distant, ye know? Like talkin’ underwater. Do that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that… conveys something. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or any pain at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes, yeah. A real faint ringin’. Not constant, just comes and goes. Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit unsteady on me feet sometimes, but I think that’s just gettin’ old! And no pain, like I said before. Just… quietin’ down, everything. It’s kinda frustrating, ya know? I used to be able to hear a pin drop. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you work or have you worked around any loud noises in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. I worked at the shoe factory for… oh, Lord, must've been forty years. Makin’ shoes. Lots of machines, clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. It was a noisy place, that’s for sure. Though, it didn't bother me then, not really. I just got used to it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it sounds like you’ve got some exposure there. Let's take a look in your ears, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll need to use an otoscope.
PATIENT: An… otoscope? Is that one of them little light things? I’ve had doctors look in me ears before, with somethin’ like that. Alright, go ahead. Just be gentle now, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. I will be as gentle as possible. Hmm. There's some cerumen buildup in both ears – a fair amount, actually. And a little bit of redness. It looks like mild inflammation. Nothing too concerning at this point, but the wax is definitely blocking your view. It could be contributing to the hearing loss.
PATIENT: Wax? Oh, goodness. I always get wax build-up. Used to use them little ear candles, but my daughter said they weren’t good for ya. So I stopped. Inflammation, ya say? Is that… serious? I don't want to go deaf or nothin’.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not serious right now. Mild inflammation just means your ears are a bit irritated. It can happen with wax buildup, or even just with age. As for the ear candles... yes, you were right to listen to your daughter. They're generally not recommended. We can try to remove the wax. I can do a simple wax removal in the office. It might be a little uncomfortable, but quick. Or, if you prefer, I can refer you to an audiologist for a more thorough cleaning and a hearing test. They'll be able to give you a better assessment of your hearing levels. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I don’t know… I don’t like the sound of anythin’ uncomfortable. A test sounds scary. But… I reckon I’d rather get it over with if it means I can hear better. Maybe just… take some of the wax out here? If it’s quick, that’d be best. I don't want to have to come back if I don't need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with a simple wax removal. It shouldn’t take long. I’ll use a small scoop and gentle irrigation. It may feel a little cool, or a bit of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Now this might feel a little strange…
PATIENT: Oh my… that is a little strange. Feels like water in me ear, which is to be expected, I s’pose. But… is it normal to feel a bit dizzy? I’m just gettin' a little lightheaded, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Just a moment. Okay. There was quite a bit of impacted wax in there. I’ve removed the bulk of it. The dizziness is likely from the irrigation stimulating your balance nerve. It should pass quickly. There’s still a little residue, but it’s significantly better. Let's see if we can get some improvement with this. I suggest you come back for a hearing test just to be sure. A mild case of fluid retention is common. I’m referring you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, she’s an excellent audiologist just down the street. Here's the referral. Schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. And avoid getting any water in your ears for a few days.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. Thank ya, Doctor. Dr. Vance, ya say? I'll give 'em a call. No water… I can do that. It’s just hard when I take a shower sometimes, ye know? Is there anythin' else I need to know? Or anythin' I should be lookin' out for?
DOCTOR: If you experience any severe pain, dizziness that doesn’t improve, or discharge from your ears, contact me immediately. Otherwise, just follow up with Dr. Vance and we’ll see what she recommends. Here’s a copy of your visit summary. It outlines everything we discussed today. I'll see you if you have further concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s all for now. Thank ya kindly, Doctor. You’ve been a big help, even if it was a little… strange at times. I appreciate ya takin’ the time. Have a good day now. .
DOCTOR: You too. .
