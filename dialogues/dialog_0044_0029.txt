DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… feeling full really quick when I eat. Doesn't matter what it is, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a whole meal. It’s been going on for a bit now, maybe a couple months, and my wife, bless her heart, thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months of feeling full very quickly, regardless of what you’re eating. That’s definitely worth looking into, and your wife is very thoughtful to encourage you to come in. Just to clarify – is this fullness accompanied by any discomfort, like bloating, nausea, or pain?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And not much nausea, either. Sometimes a little… just a little bit unsettled, maybe, right after I eat, but not often. It’s more just… stopping. Like my stomach just says, “No more,” after only a tiny bit of food. It’s a strange feeling, really. Used to be able to put away a good plate of salmon, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no pain, occasional mild unsettled feeling, but primarily this early sensation of fullness. And you've noticed a change from being able to eat a normal amount previously. That's helpful to know. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss along with this?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little, I think. My wife has been saying my pants are a bit looser. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but I reckon I’ve lost a few pounds. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. It’s probably just getting old, eh?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Mr. Obarr. Even a small amount of unintentional weight loss is something we need to take seriously. It’s not necessarily “just getting old,” though that can play a part. Let’s talk a little bit more about your eating habits. Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all. Food goes down just fine. I eat… well, pretty much what I always have. Lots of fish, some berries when they’re in season, a bit of bread. My wife does most of the cooking, and she makes good, healthy meals. I haven’t changed what I eat, or how I eat, really. Just this feeling of being full too fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in your diet or swallowing. That's good to rule out. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… not really, I don’t suppose. Everything's been pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No different than usual. Nothing to worry about there, I don’t think. My wife would be the first to notice, and she hasn’t said a word. She's pretty good at keeping track of things like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Obarr. Your wife sounds very attentive. Now, let’s go over a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I had a bit of a cough a few years back, but the doctor said it was just a bad cold. And my knees are getting a bit creaky, but that’s just old age again. Never been in hospital for anything serious, thankfully. Never had any major operations or anything like that. I used to be pretty healthy, always out fishing and working.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical conditions, just a cold a few years ago and some knee discomfort. No hospitalizations or surgeries. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. A little bit of fish oil now and then, maybe, but that's it. Mostly just eat good food and try to stay active. My wife keeps telling me I should take something for my knees, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or regular supplements. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife always checks when she's making something new, just in case, but I’ve never had a problem. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Obarr. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my mother, she had a bit of trouble with her stomach when she got older. The doctor said something about ulcers, but it was a long time ago. And my father, he had a heart condition. He wasn’t a healthy man, always smoking and drinking. That's about it, I think. Nobody else that I can recall had any serious problems. My mother's side, they were mostly healthy folk, lived long lives out on the coast.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of stomach ulcers on your mother's side and heart condition on your father's side. That’s helpful information. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve lived in Haida Gwaii my whole life. Always been a fisherman, mostly. Retired now, but I still get out on the water when I can. I’m married, as you know. My wife, Sarah, and I have been together for… oh, goodness, almost 60 years now! We don't have any children. Mostly just a quiet life, enjoying the scenery and the company of our friends and family. I used to drink a bit, but I gave that up years ago. Never smoked. That’s about it, I suppose. A pretty simple life.
DOCTOR: That's lovely, Mr. Obarr. A long and happy marriage is a wonderful thing. And good on you for giving up the alcohol. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. It shouldn't take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is regular, and I don’t hear any unusual sounds in your lungs. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I don't feel any masses or tenderness, but your abdomen is a little bit soft. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Those are normal. Finally, I'll take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Okay, all those vitals look within normal limits. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m a little concerned about the early satiety and unintentional weight loss. It could be a number of things, but we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We should also consider a stool test to rule out any bleeding. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then let's do it. Blood tests and a… a stool test, you said? Well, I suppose it's all part of getting old, eh? Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. I'm happy to follow your instructions. I trust you’ll let me know what the results are as soon as you have them? My wife will be wanting to know, too, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes, a stool test. It’s not the most pleasant thing, but it can give us valuable information. I'll write you a requisition for the blood tests and stool test. You can take this to the lab just down the hall – they’re open until 5pm today. For the stool test, you’ll receive a collection kit from the lab with instructions. It just involves collecting a small sample – the lab will explain everything. I'll have my nurse, Sarah – no relation to your wife, I assure you! – go over the instructions with you as well. Once the results are back, I’ll give you a call as soon as possible to discuss them. It usually takes a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. A few days for the results, and watch out for any worsening symptoms. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not just dismissing it as old age. I'll get the tests done right away. And please tell your Sarah thank you for going over the instructions – I’m sure it’ll be easier with someone explaining it. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It's my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. And I will certainly pass along your thanks to Sarah. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Asami. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your kindness. I'll be in touch when I've had the tests done. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. You have a good day as well.
