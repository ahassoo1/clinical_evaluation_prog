DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s nice to meet you, I suppose. Though I doubt you’ve had many patients like me. I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens easily. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I don’t want any… complications.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s wonderful you’re planning for this, and it’s very responsible of you to think ahead and address any potential concerns. It's good you're being proactive. To help me get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little bit more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, history. Right. Well, I’ve been generally healthy. I mean, I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps... but nothing serious. I was divorced ten years ago, and frankly, that was the most traumatic thing that’s happened to my body. I don’t really do complications. And I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. I suppose bicycle repair keeps me quite fit, though. It should be a healthy lifestyle. Is that enough “history” for you?
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, Ms. Shteynberg, thank you. And yes, your Medicare coverage is certainly relevant, as it will impact what tests and services are covered. It sounds like you’ve been quite healthy overall, which is excellent. Just to clarify, when you say "childhood things," do you recall any significant complications from measles or mumps?
PATIENT: Complications? No. I had them, I got over them. It was… a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t see what measles from when I was seven has to do with having a baby now. It feels like you’re trying to make this more difficult than it needs to be. I just want to know if everything is… working, and how to make it happen quickly and without trouble. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize if my questions feel extensive; I want to ensure we cover all necessary bases for a healthy pregnancy. While childhood illnesses themselves may not be directly relevant, understanding your overall health picture is important. To move forward, let’s focus on more recent history. Have you had any significant medical conditions diagnosed in adulthood—high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, I'm healthy. I eat reasonably well, I exercise, I don't smoke, I barely drink. I'm a bicycle repairer, not a… a mess. Honestly, I find this line of questioning… insulting. Are you implying something? I’m quite capable of carrying a baby, thank you very much. I just want to make sure it's easy. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, please allow me to reassure you, I am not implying anything. I sincerely apologize if my questions have come across that way. My intention is simply to gather a complete medical history to provide you with the best possible care. I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you that I respect your capabilities and desire for a smooth pregnancy. Let's try a different approach. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No! Never. That’s why I’m here. And frankly, the longer we sit here asking about things that don’t matter, the more anxious I become about whether I can be. It's rather obvious, isn’t it? Look, I’m a practical woman. Tell me what tests I need, schedule them, and let’s get this done. I have a shop to run, you know. This is valuable time.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to prioritize efficiency, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize again for the delay. I understand your concerns, and we will focus on the necessary steps to assess your ability to conceive and ensure a healthy pregnancy. Given you’ve never been pregnant before, a basic fertility workup would be a good starting point. This typically includes a physical exam, blood tests to check your hormone levels and overall health, and potentially an ultrasound to evaluate your uterus and ovaries. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Finally. That sounds… reasonable. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And I want the results quickly. I don't want to be waiting weeks. Can you guarantee that? And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I have very little patience for… fuss. Just tell me what I need to do and when.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your concerns about time and comfort, and I will do my best to expedite the process and minimize any discomfort. We can start with a physical exam today, which will include checking your blood pressure, heart rate, and a general assessment. Then, we'll order the blood tests, which will require a visit to the lab. I will personally follow up with the lab to prioritize your results, and we should have them back within 3-5 business days. Regarding the ultrasound, we can schedule that for next week, depending on availability. It’s a non-invasive procedure that provides valuable information about your reproductive organs. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Get the bloodwork ordered. And schedule the ultrasound. Next week is fine, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my shop hours. And please, make sure the results are expedited. I'm not a patient woman. Now, let’s get on with it, shall we? What do you need first?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the bloodwork order printed out for you now. You’ll need to take that to the lab across the hall. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. The order specifies a fasting blood glucose, complete blood count, TSH, prolactin, FSH, and estradiol. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. No, I don’t need a lecture on what each one is. Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. I can read. Now, let’s get this over with. And please, don’t keep me waiting. My time is valuable. Where is this “lab,” exactly?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. The lab is just across the hall, room 203. The receptionist there will be expecting you. It's best to go on an empty stomach, so if you've had anything to eat or drink this morning, you may need to reschedule. They close at 4:00 PM, so please go before then. After you’ve had your blood drawn, you can return here, and we can discuss the next steps and schedule the ultrasound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Room 203. Empty stomach. I get it. Honestly, it’s all very… clinical. But alright. I'll go do this ridiculous bloodwork. Don't expect me to be happy about it. And don't make me wait long for an appointment. I have a shop to run, you know. .
