DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, frankly, it’s about this…this medical marijuana. My niece, she’s been telling me about it for aches and pains, and I thought, well, why not explore it? Though I must say, I have my reservations about the whole thing. It just seems…unconventional.
DOCTOR: Unconventional is one way to put it. Alright. And you're considering it for aches and pains?
PATIENT: Yes, aches and pains. It’s mostly my back, you see. Years of…well, work. I was a bailiff for a good many years, hauling paperwork and, occasionally, people. Not a glamorous profession, I assure you. It's just gotten worse as I’ve gotten older, and honestly, I'm tired of feeling…stiff. I’ve tried some of the over-the-counter remedies, but they don’t seem to do much good anymore.
DOCTOR: Right, back pain. And how long have you been experiencing this back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Decades, really. But it’s gotten particularly… insistent these last few years. Since my retirement, if I'm being honest. One would think less physical activity would help, wouldn't one? But it seems to have done quite the opposite. It's just a constant nagging, you understand? Not a sharp pain, just…there.
DOCTOR: And does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Everything, dear. Simply moving makes it worse. Bending, lifting, standing for too long, sitting for too long…really, anything. Although, I suppose lying down helps, but then one can’t get anything done, can one? It's a rather frustrating situation, to be perfectly frank. My husband keeps telling me to “take it easy,” but that's hardly practical.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? Oh, no, nothing like that. It's all localized in my back. No shooting pains, no tingling, no numbness…just a dull, constant ache. I do get a bit of stiffness in the mornings, though. It takes me a good while to get going, I must say. I don’t fancy being one of those people who can’t even get out of bed on their own. Now that would be dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the back pain?
PATIENT: Well, one gets a bit…irritable, naturally, when one is constantly in discomfort. And my sleep isn’t as restful as it used to be. I wake up several times a night, tossing and turning. It’s hardly a groundbreaking observation, Doctor. When one is in pain, one doesn't simply frolic and sing, you know. It affects everything. Though I assure you, my husband is the main recipient of the irritability. He means well, but…
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any history of any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Serious? Well, nothing major. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, and I’ve had the usual…colds, flu, that sort of thing. My blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but it’s generally well-controlled with diet. I wouldn't say I'm a particularly sickly person. My mother lived to be ninety-five, so I suppose I have good genes. No heart trouble, no diabetes, no…anything truly alarming, thankfully. And I certainly haven’t been involved in any serious accidents. Is that sufficient, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure. Very small. My doctor insists I take it, you know how they are. Always wanting to prescribe something. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for the aches, but it barely touches the pain anymore, as I mentioned. Honestly, Doctor, I don't like being on medication unless absolutely necessary. It always makes me feel…sluggish. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible, though I haven't found anything that truly works for this back pain.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've never had an allergy in my life. I eat everything in moderation, of course. No shellfish, perhaps – I don’t much care for it – but certainly no allergies. I was raised on a very healthy diet, you see. Fresh fruits, vegetables, proper meats. It's all very sensible, really. I've always been quite careful about what I put into my body. It’s hardly something one would need to worry about. Are we quite finished with the preliminary questions, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: I suppose so. Though I must say, I don't see what poking and prodding will accomplish. I’ve lived with this pain for decades, Doctor. I rather think I know where it hurts. But very well. Just please be gentle. And don't take too long. I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your stomach on the examination table, please. I'm going to palpate your spine to assess tenderness and range of motion. Okay. There is some tenderness upon palpation of the lumbar spine, specifically L4-L5. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with flexion and extension. No radicular symptoms present during straight leg raise test. No obvious muscle spasm. I don’t detect anything alarming, but it does appear to be a musculoskeletal issue.
PATIENT: Well, that's hardly surprising, is it? I told you it was my back. L4-L5, you say? Sounds terribly technical. And you detected "tenderness"? I should think so! It hurts, Doctor. That’s rather the point of this whole exercise. So, what does this mean? Are you going to prescribe me something? Or are we finally going to discuss this…medical marijuana? Honestly, I find all this poking and prodding rather unnecessary, but if it pleases you…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. The exam confirms a musculoskeletal issue, likely a strain or mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. As for your request regarding medical marijuana…frankly, I don’t recommend it for your condition. There's limited evidence to support its use for chronic back pain, and potential side effects and interactions. I suggest a course of physical therapy, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. If the pain doesn't improve after a few weeks of therapy, we can discuss other options, such as a referral to a pain management specialist. But I strongly advise against self-treating with unproven remedies.
PATIENT: Physical therapy? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve tried physical therapy before. It’s simply…stretching and exercises. It’s tedious and frankly, ineffective. And over-the-counter pain relievers barely touch the pain, as I’ve already explained. You’re telling me nothing new. And with all due respect, Doctor, I fail to see how you can dismiss medical marijuana so readily. My niece, she swears by it. It’s helped her with her…condition immensely. I came here seeking a certification, not a lecture on the merits of stretching. I’m a grown woman and perfectly capable of making my own decisions. Are you refusing to certify me? Because if that’s the case, I’ll simply find another doctor who respects my autonomy.
DOCTOR: Ellan, I understand your frustration, but my primary responsibility is to provide you with safe and evidence-based care. The evidence supporting medical marijuana for chronic back pain is simply not strong enough to recommend it, and I’m not comfortable certifying you for its use based on anecdotal evidence. I can provide you with a referral to a pain management specialist who can offer alternative treatment options, such as injections or nerve blocks. However, I will not compromise my professional judgment to fulfill a request that I believe is not in your best interest. I’m happy to discuss this further, but I want to be clear: I will not be certifying you for medical marijuana. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Injections? Nerve blocks? Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me? I'm not interested in invasive procedures. I came here for a simple certification, not a medical experiment. It's quite clear you've already made up your mind, haven't you? You're simply dismissing my concerns and refusing to consider my options. It's…disappointing, frankly. I think I've wasted enough of my time here. I'll find a doctor who understands my needs and respects my autonomy. Thank you for nothing. And frankly, Doctor, you might benefit from a little more empathy. Good day.
