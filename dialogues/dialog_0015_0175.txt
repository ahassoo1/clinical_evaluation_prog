DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's my back. It's been pretty painful lately. Not sure what I did, to be honest. Just…aches all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Back pain." And you said this is recent onset?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty recent. Maybe…a couple of weeks now? It started kinda slow, just a little twinge after gardening, but now it's…well, it's a constant thing. Even when I'm just sitting.
DOCTOR: "Constant," you say. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's not like a sharp pain, not really. More of a dull ache, like a really sore muscle that won't go away. Sometimes it feels like it's shooting down my leg a little bit, but not always. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me something to work with. And this pain radiating down your leg…where exactly does it go?
PATIENT: It's mostly down the back of my leg, kind of like where your hamstring is, you know? Not all the way to my foot, thankfully. It stops around my calf, usually. It’s worse when I try to stand up straight for too long, I think. Or when I bend over.
DOCTOR: So, primarily in the posterior leg…and exacerbated by standing and bending. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Sitting actually helps, surprisingly. And laying down, especially with a pillow under my knees. That takes the pressure off, I guess. And…warm baths. A warm bath always feels good. Not a cure, but it eases it for a little while.
DOCTOR: Warm baths are palliative, but not diagnostic. Now, let's go through some basics. Have you had any recent injuries?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, I was gardening, but didn't fall or anything. Just bending and digging. Nothing unusual. I’m pretty careful, you know? I’m not a young man anymore, gotta watch myself.
DOCTOR: Indeed. And any history of back problems prior to these few weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, when I was younger, playing basketball, I pulled something a few times. But that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, just a few muscle strains. I never really saw a doctor for them, just rested it and it went away. It's not the same kind of pain, though. This is…deeper, I think. More constant.
DOCTOR: "Deeper, more constant." Very well. Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Everything feels…normal, strength-wise. I can walk okay, no problems there. No tingling either, just the ache. It’s just annoying, you know? Makes it hard to do things.
DOCTOR: "Annoying." Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm not very flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Mr. Way. I'm going to palpate your spine and assess your range of motion. Please tell me if anything causes pain. First, I'm going to feel along your lower back. Does this cause any tenderness?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, right there. That’s a little sore. Not awful, but definitely sensitive. A little to the left of your hand, I think. It feels…tight there too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about when I ask you to bend forward?
PATIENT: Oof. That's definitely not comfortable. It hurts right in my lower back, like a pulling sensation. Not a sharp pain, more like a strain. I can't bend over very far without it hurting. It's worse when I go past a certain point.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, tenderness to palpation…and pain with flexion. Now, could you please lie on your back?
PATIENT: Sure. There. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: I'm going to lift your leg up, keeping it straight. Tell me if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. First, the right leg… Any pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little stretch, that’s all. Nothing bad.
DOCTOR: And now the left… Oh. There we are. And what about now, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that’s it. That sends a sharp pain down my leg, right where it was aching before. Not all the way to my foot, but it’s definitely there. Stop, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, stop there. Positive straight leg raise on the left side. That’s…concerning. Now, lie still for a moment. Based on your history and the exam, it appears you have likely irritated the sciatic nerve. This is consistent with lumbar radiculopathy, potentially caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. However, without imaging, it’s impossible to confirm. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Lumbar…what now? Uh, I think you lost me a little bit there, Doctor. Sciatic nerve, I’ve heard of that…but what does that mean exactly? And a…herniated disc? Is that serious? I just have a sore back, I thought.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. In simple terms, the sciatic nerve is a large nerve that runs from your lower back down your leg. When it gets compressed or irritated – which is what appears to be happening here – it causes pain, numbness, or weakness in your leg. A herniated disc is when the cushion between the bones in your spine bulges out and presses on that nerve. It can be serious, but it doesn’t always require surgery. The first step is to confirm the diagnosis with an MRI. I’m going to order one for you. Until then, I recommend rest, avoiding heavy lifting, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. I can also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the pain. However, given your age and the potential severity of this condition, I also want to refer you to a specialist—a neurosurgeon—for a consultation. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A neurosurgeon? Whoa, hold on. That sounds…serious. Is surgery definitely going to be needed? I just want to get my back better, not have an operation! And an MRI…that costs a lot, doesn’t it? I don't have insurance, Doctor. I’m not sure I can afford all this. And what about the muscle relaxant? Will that make me sleepy? I need to be able to think clearly. This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, the referral to the neurosurgeon is precautionary. It does not mean you will automatically need surgery. It simply allows a specialist to assess your condition and discuss all available treatment options with you. Regarding the MRI, I understand your financial concerns. I will have my staff assist you in finding facilities that offer financial assistance programs or reduced rates for uninsured patients. As for the muscle relaxant, yes, it can cause drowsiness, but the dosage can be adjusted to minimize that effect. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. However, it’s important to understand that delaying treatment could worsen your condition. A proper diagnosis and appropriate management plan are crucial. Ignoring the pain will not make it go away, Mr. Way. I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes ruling out serious complications. Do you understand now?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. It's just…a lot. Surgery sounds scary, and I don't have a lot of money. I guess…I guess the MRI is a good idea. And maybe the muscle relaxant, if it doesn't make me too sleepy. And the specialist…I’ll think about it. Can you at least tell me how long I’ll have to wait for the MRI appointment? And how much it might cost, roughly? Just so I have an idea. I really appreciate you explaining everything, even if it's not what I wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: The wait time for an MRI appointment varies depending on the facility and their availability. My staff will contact several local imaging centers and find the soonest available appointment for you. As for the cost, a lumbar MRI without contrast typically ranges from $400 to $1200, but this can vary significantly. We will provide you with a detailed estimate from each facility, and my staff will also assist you in exploring potential financial assistance options. I will write a prescription for a low dose of cyclobenzaprine, the muscle relaxant. Start with one 5mg tablet at bedtime. If it causes excessive drowsiness, reduce the dosage to half a tablet. I also recommend taking ibuprofen 600mg three times a day with food to help with the pain and inflammation. I will have my staff schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the MRI results and your response to the medication. In the meantime, avoid any activities that exacerbate your pain, and if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder problems—seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it… for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve given me a lot to think about. I really hope it’s not something serious. I’ll talk to my wife and see what she thinks about the specialist. And I’ll call your staff about the MRI and the financial assistance. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will be in touch. Remember, prompt follow-up is crucial. You may go now. .
