DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Ka Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my regular check-up showed my cholesterol is a little high, that's what the nurse said, anyway. Hyper... something? I don’t really remember all the fancy words, but she said I needed to talk to a doctor about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high cholesterol. Hyperlipidemia, yes, that’s the term. It’s quite common, Ms. Geho, and we can definitely look into that. Do you recall what your numbers were, if the nurse shared them with you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... she did write some numbers down. Okay, here we go. Total cholesterol was… 245, I think. And the bad one, LDL, was 160. The good one, HDL, was 45. Does that make sense? I'm really not good with these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that all makes perfect sense, thank you. Those numbers do indicate elevated cholesterol, specifically the LDL, which is what we often refer to as the "bad" cholesterol. An HDL of 45 is a little on the lower side, but not drastically so. To get a better understanding of what might be contributing to this, and to figure out the best course of action, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your overall health and lifestyle, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ask away! I'm happy to answer whatever I can. I want to get this sorted out, you know? It just feels… unsettling, having something “high” when I feel pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is unsettling to hear something isn’t quite optimal when you’re feeling well. That’s why we investigate. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. A few colds here and there, like everyone gets, but nothing serious. My parents both lived into their eighties, and they were relatively healthy too. My mother had some arthritis in her knees when she got older, but that was about it. No heart problems or anything. Oh! I did have my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that was a one-time thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – a healthy family history is certainly a positive. And thank you for mentioning the gallbladder removal; that’s important to record. So, fifteen years ago for the cholecystectomy. No complications from that surgery, I hope?
PATIENT: No, no complications at all. Everything went smoothly, thankfully. I was in the hospital for a couple of days, and then I was back to normal pretty quickly. I remember being a little tired for a week or so, but that was it. They said it was a pretty straightforward case. I haven't had any trouble with digestion since then, either. I’m a pretty boring patient, really!
DOCTOR: Not boring at all, Ms. Geho! A straightforward medical history is actually very helpful. It makes things much easier. Let’s move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… well, ex-husband, he smoked for a while, but I always made him go outside. It just never appealed to me. I can't stand the smell of it, either. It makes me cough just thinking about it!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s another positive. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week? It's usually just one glass, though. On special occasions, maybe I’ll have two. I don’t drink beer or hard liquor. Mostly red wine, I think it's good for you in moderation… or so I've heard. I’m not a big drinker, really.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Moderate alcohol consumption, as you said, isn’t generally a concern. Now, let's talk about diet and exercise. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, a typical day... Well, for breakfast, I usually have oatmeal with some fruit – berries, usually. And a little bit of honey. For lunch, it depends. Sometimes I’ll have a salad with chicken or tuna, and a whole-wheat roll. Other times, I'll have a sandwich - turkey or ham. And for dinner… I try to eat something healthy, like fish or chicken with vegetables. I really like roasted vegetables. I do have a sweet tooth, though. I enjoy a little bit of chocolate after dinner. And maybe a cookie or two sometimes, if I'm feeling indulgent! I try not to overdo it, though.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fairly balanced diet, Ms. Geho. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I try to walk most days. I live in a pretty rural area, so I walk around my property and on the country roads. It’s usually about thirty minutes, maybe an hour, depending on the weather. I don’t really exercise exercise, if that makes sense. I don’t go to the gym or anything. Just walking, and doing a little bit of gardening. I like being outdoors, so that’s a good motivator.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Geho. Regular walking and gardening are both fantastic for your health. Now, before we discuss potential next steps, let’s quickly go over your current medications, if any, and any allergies you may have.
PATIENT: Well, I don't take any regular medications, thankfully. Just an occasional ibuprofen for a headache. And I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Wait! I am slightly sensitive to bee stings. Not a full-blown allergic reaction, but I get a pretty bad local swelling. I carry an EpiPen, just in case, but I haven't had to use it in years. Here it is. Just to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the bee sting sensitivity, Ms. Geho. That’s important to record, even if it’s a mild reaction. So, no regular medications, and a mild sensitivity to bee stings. Okay, based on everything you’ve told me, and the numbers from your check-up, it seems like we're dealing with elevated cholesterol. We can approach this in a few different ways. Lifestyle modifications – continuing the healthy diet and regular walking – are a good starting point, and often very effective. However, given your numbers, it may also be beneficial to consider a medication to help lower your cholesterol. Before we decide on a course of action, I’d like to order some additional blood tests to get a more comprehensive picture of your cholesterol levels and rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests are fine. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, I suppose medication is the next step. I’d rather not take it if I don’t need to, but I want to get this sorted out, you know? I just want to be healthy for as long as possible. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? And will I need to fast before I go? I always forget that part.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Geho. That’s a very sensible approach. We’ll start with a comprehensive lipid panel, which will give us a detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels. We'll also check your blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels – just to make sure everything else is working properly. And yes, you will need to fast for 9-12 hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, if that works for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds fine. I can do that. Nine to twelve hours… I can manage that. I think I’ll have a big dinner tonight, then just water until tomorrow. Is there anything else I need to know before I go for the tests? And about the results... how long will it take to get them back? I always worry about waiting for results.
DOCTOR: That’s a good plan, Ms. Geho. No, there’s nothing else you need to do to prepare for the tests. Just try to stay relaxed, and drink plenty of water. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab to send them to me. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as I’ve reviewed them and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We’ll go over the results together, and decide on the best course of action for you. I understand your anxiety about waiting; it’s perfectly normal. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here's the lab requisition form. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and not rushing me. I appreciate your patience. I'll see you when the results are back. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. You have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT:
