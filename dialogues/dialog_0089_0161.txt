DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into something... about preventing HIV. She said I should talk to someone, and she recommended this clinic. I don't really know much about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina, that’s perfectly alright. It's good you’re being proactive. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is definitely something we can discuss. To get a better understanding of your situation and see if it’s right for you, let’s talk a bit about your risk factors. First, could you tell me a little about your sexual history?
PATIENT: Sexual history… Okay. Um… I’ve had a few long-term relationships over the years, all monogamous. But it’s been… a while since any of those ended. And, lately, I’ve been… meeting people more casually. Not a lot of people, but… enough that I figured it was better to be safe than sorry, you know? It’s not something I talk about easily, if that makes sense. I don’t want to get into specifics, but… that’s the gist of it.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Helaina. It’s very responsible of you to consider this. And you absolutely don’t need to share any details you’re uncomfortable with. "Meeting people more casually" is enough information for now. Just to clarify – are these encounters with men, women, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly men, Doctor. A couple with women, but… very few. It's not something I've done often. Mostly men, though. And, like I said, it hasn’t been a regular thing. Just… occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly men. And occasionally with women. Good to know. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times. When I was younger, with partners, you know, just to be sure. And then… I had a test maybe five years ago, just a routine check-up with my primary care doctor. It was negative then. I remember specifically because the doctor made a big deal about how good the results were. I think it was a standard blood test, not anything special.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Helaina. A negative result five years ago is helpful information. And a standard blood test is what we typically use. Now, outside of sexual activity, are there any other risk factors we should discuss?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I can think of. I don’t use drugs, I don’t share needles… I've never had a blood transfusion. I don’t have any medical conditions that would make me more susceptible, as far as I know. I mean, I'm a little older, but… that’s just age, right? Nothing specifically risky. I work as a parking attendant, so I'm mostly outdoors. I guess that’s it. I’m pretty careful, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful. No history of drug use, transfusions, or medical conditions that increase risk. And working as a parking attendant doesn't present any known risks. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I take a daily vitamin, that’s it. And occasionally some over-the-counter pain relievers if I have a headache. But no prescription medications, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. I think the fresh air from work helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and only take a daily vitamin and occasional pain relievers. That's good. To make sure PrEP is a good fit, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work. The blood work will check your kidney function, liver function, and make sure you don't currently have an HIV infection. It will also rule out other sexually transmitted infections. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing, you know? I’d rather be safe than find out later I should have. So, yes, blood work and an exam are good. What does the exam involve, exactly? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's a very sensible approach, Helaina. The exam will be fairly straightforward. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a general physical assessment. I’ll also need to collect a urine sample to screen for other infections. And then, a brief rectal exam is recommended to screen for other sexually transmitted infections. It's a standard part of the PrEP screening process, and it’s important for your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A... rectal exam? Is that… absolutely necessary? I mean, I understand it’s standard, but… it feels a little… invasive. Could we skip that part? I’m already getting the blood work and the urine sample. Would that be enough? I’m not experiencing any symptoms, and I haven't had any issues… honestly, the thought of that makes me very nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Helaina. It is a sensitive exam, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel uncomfortable. However, a rectal exam is the most accurate way to screen for asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections that can sometimes be present even without noticeable symptoms. These infections, if left untreated, can sometimes complicate PrEP use or impact your overall health. While the blood work and urine sample are helpful, they don’t always detect everything. We can proceed without it, but I would strongly recommend it for a comprehensive assessment. If you're still hesitant, we could discuss getting tested for those specific infections through a different method, though it might require a separate visit to a specialist. Would you like me to explain the risks of proceeding without the rectal exam, or talk about alternative testing options?
PATIENT: Okay. If it’s really that important… then, okay. Do it. But please… be quick. And explain everything as you go, so I know what’s happening. I just… I’m not a fan of those kinds of exams, honestly. The less I know beforehand, the more anxious I get. So, tell me what you’re doing, okay? And… try to be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I completely understand your anxiety, and I will absolutely explain everything as I go, and be as gentle as possible. We’ll take things at your pace. If you’ll follow me, we can get started in the exam room. First, I'll need you to change into a gown. I’ll leave you some privacy to do that, and I’ll be right outside when you're ready. We'll start with the standard physical exam – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure – and then we’ll move onto the other tests. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think I'm ready. Just… please remember to explain what you're doing. Thank you for being understanding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. I will. Take your time getting changed. I'll be just outside when you're ready. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you're uncomfortable at any point.
