DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… good to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? It is… difficult to say exactly. It’s with the… the words. They do not… come so easily now. It is frustrating, yes. I forget… what I wish to say. It has been… some time now, this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with finding the right words and remembering things, and that it's been going on for a while. That is frustrating. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s happening. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this difficulty with your words?
PATIENT: When did it start… That is… a good question. It was… after my wife, Elfriede… passed away. Yes, after that. It was… gradual, I think. Not sudden. Just… slowly getting harder to… to speak my thoughts. It is… difficult to pinpoint a date, I’m sorry. My memory… it is not what it was.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's very common for stress and grief to affect memory and concentration. So, it started gradually after Elfriede passed. Can you describe how it's difficult?
PATIENT: Hmm… how it is difficult… It is like… the word is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot… grasp it. Or… I know what I want to say, but the right word… it escapes me. Sometimes, I use the… wrong word, completely. Not what I mean at all. And… sometimes, I stop mid-sentence… and… forget what I was saying. It is… embarrassing, yes. Especially when speaking with others. I find myself… pausing a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and I can see why it would be embarrassing. It sounds like you’re describing what we call aphasia – difficulty with language. There are different types, and different causes. To help me narrow down what might be going on, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any difficulty with understanding what others say?
PATIENT: Understanding others… Yes, sometimes. Not always, but… sometimes I must ask them to repeat themselves. Or… to speak slower. It is usually when they use… complicated words, perhaps. Or… when there is a lot of noise. But… generally, I understand. It is finding the words myself that is the problem, mostly. I apologize if this is not… clear. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining perfectly well, Sherrell. It’s very helpful. So, mostly the issue is expressing yourself, finding the right words, and not so much understanding others, although it can be harder with complicated words or background noise. Okay. Let’s move on to other things. Have you noticed any weakness on one side of your body – your face, arm, or leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… Hmm. That is… a good question. I do not think so. No… not that I have noticed. My legs… they tire easily, perhaps. But that is… from walking, I believe. I am an older man, yes. But… no noticeable weakness. I can… move everything as usual. I do not drop things… not any more than usual, anyway. It is… difficult to say for certain, I suppose. It is… hard to notice these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No recent weakness, just some leg fatigue with walking. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed – like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. I had… high blood pressure, yes. For many years. But… the doctor, he gave me… pills. For a long time now. And… I believe it is… controlled now. My wife, she took care of the pills… mostly. I see the doctor regularly, yes. But… I do not remember all the details. I do not have… diabetes, I do not think. Or… cholesterol. Just… the blood pressure. And… a bad back, sometimes. But that is… old age, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently managed with medication. And some occasional back pain. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: The name of the… pill? Hmm… That is… difficult. My wife, she handled all that. It is a… small, white pill, I believe. I take it… every morning. And… sometimes, in the evening. I am sorry… I truly do not remember the name. I know it is… important, yes. But… it escapes me. Is that… alright? I apologize. It is… frustrating for me as well. I wish I could remember.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. Don’t apologize at all. It’s very common to not remember medication names. We can look it up in your records. Okay, it looks like you're taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that is… the name. Thank you. It is… good to know it has a name. Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think… I had… my appendix removed, many years ago. When I was… a young man, I believe. And… I had surgery on my back… for a… slipped disc. A long time ago, as well. It did not… help much, to be honest. It still… hurts sometimes. That is… all I can remember. I apologize if I am… forgetting something. It is… difficult to recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your appendix removed and surgery on your back for a slipped disc. That’s good information. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother… she had… heart problems, yes. When she was… an older woman. I believe she had… angina. And… my father, he… I do not remember him well. He passed away when I was… young. My wife, she said he had… high blood pressure, perhaps. But… I do not remember much about it. And… her mother, she had… arthritis, I believe. But… not much else that I recall. It is… difficult to remember so far back. I apologize. It is… frustrating for me as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems on your mother’s side, possible high blood pressure on your father's, and arthritis on your wife's side. That's helpful. Now, one last set of questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. No… not that I know of. I have never… reacted badly to any… medications, to my knowledge. Or… food. I can… eat everything, as far as I remember. I have… a slight sensitivity to… dust, perhaps. But it is… not a serious allergy. Just… a little sneezing. Is that… alright? I apologize if I am… forgetting something. It is… difficult to recall all of these things. I wish I could be… more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies except for a mild sensitivity to dust. Alright, Sherrell. Thank you for answering all of my questions. It sounds like you've been experiencing some difficulty with finding the right words and remembering things since your wife passed away. There's a history of high blood pressure, and you take Lisinopril. You've had your appendix removed and back surgery, and there's some family history of heart problems. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your overall health and neurological function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly alright. If you think it will… help, then… please do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I want to… understand what is happening. And… I want to feel… better, if possible. Please… proceed as you think best. I will… cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. Alright, I'm going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your arm. And the other side. Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that… alright? It is… a little difficult, perhaps. My hands… they are not as strong as they once were. I apologize if it is… weak.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s good. Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head, just your eyes. Okay. Now, can you say "apple" for me?
PATIENT: “Apple.” It… came out alright, yes? It is… a little difficult to… form the words sometimes. It is… not as easy as it once was. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine. And can you repeat after me: "No ifs, ands, or buts"?
PATIENT: “No… ifs… ands… or… buts.” It is… difficult, yes. My tongue… it feels… clumsy. Is that… alright? I apologize if it is… not very clear. It is… frustrating for me as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Thank you for that. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing aphasia. Specifically, it seems to be a non-fluent aphasia, meaning you have trouble forming words and speaking smoothly, but your comprehension seems relatively intact. The weakness I noted in your grip is mild but should be monitored. However, aphasia can be caused by many things – stroke, head injury, dementia, even certain medications. To figure out the cause of your aphasia, we need to do some further testing. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain. And I want to get some blood work done, just to rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work… Yes, that… sounds alright. If it will… help to understand what is happening, then… please do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I want to… know the cause, yes. And… I want to… feel better, if possible. Is it… painful? The MRI, I mean. I apologize for… asking so many questions. It is… difficult for me to… understand all of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s good to ask questions. The MRI is not painful at all. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. It’s a little loud, so we’ll give you earplugs. You’ll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, hearing aids – before the scan. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The blood work is just a simple blood draw, and it will help us rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms. I’ll have my nurse schedule both tests for you. She’ll also give you some instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Instructions… Yes, that would be… very helpful. I worry… about forgetting things. So… written instructions would be… best. And… thank you for… explaining everything so clearly. It… eases my mind somewhat. No… I do not think I have any… other questions right now. But… if I think of something… may I… contact you?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Yes, please contact the office if you have any questions at all. My nurse will give you the direct number when she schedules the tests. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders – to help us interpret the MRI results and develop a treatment plan. And I’ll write you a prescription for some vitamins, just to support your overall brain health. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Sherrell. Don't worry. And remember, I’m here to help you every step of the way.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… means a lot. To know… someone is helping. And… to have a plan. I… appreciate your kindness. I believe… that is all for now, yes? I will… wait for my nurse, then. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, Sherrell. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the tests and give you the referral and prescription. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions at all. Take care, and I'll see you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will… take care. And… thank you again for everything. .
