DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been a little hard to… go to the bathroom, lately. Like, I feel like I have to, but not much comes out. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Uncomfortable how?
PATIENT: Well, it's not painful, exactly. More like… a fullness. A heavy feeling. And I have to… push a little more than usual. Sometimes I feel like I can’t get it all out, you know? It worries me some.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A feeling of incomplete evacuation and needing to strain. And this has been going on for about a month now?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month, give or take. It comes and goes, but mostly it’s… there. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured it was just something I ate. But it hasn’t gotten better, and now… well, now I thought I should see someone.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you noticing any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color or consistency?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Everything looks… normal, as far as I can tell. It’s just… harder to push it out. And sometimes it feels like there’s still some left in there, even after I’ve gone. I haven’t noticed any changes in the… color, no. Just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I eat pretty simple. Mostly fish, some rice, and whatever vegetables my daughter brings when she visits. I don’t drink a lot of fluids, I suppose. Mostly just water with my meals. Not much else. I don’t eat a lot of… fast food, or sugary things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how often would you say you're having a bowel movement these days?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It used to be pretty regular, every day or so. Now? Maybe every other day, sometimes every three days. It’s not like it never happens, but it’s not the same. It’s… unpredictable, I guess you could say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no real pain. Maybe a little bit of… fullness after I eat, but not bad. No bloating, and definitely no… nausea. I haven't thrown up or anything like that. Just the trouble getting things… moving.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any history of constipation, or have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other screening tests for colon cancer?
PATIENT: I don’t think so, not really. I’ve always been pretty regular, like I said. As for… a colonoscopy? No, I don’t think I’ve ever had one of those. My daughter keeps telling me I should, but… I’ve never gotten around to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gives me for my blood pressure. A little white pill, I think. And no, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And could you tell me your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had… trouble with her stomach sometimes. Not sure what it was, exactly. And my father… he passed away when I was young, from something else. I don’t… I don’t really know much about his health. We didn't talk about those things much. My daughter says her grandmother on her side had some trouble, too, but I don’t know the details. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a rectal exam. It’s standard procedure to check for any abnormalities, and it will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. I trust your judgment. It’s… a little embarrassing, I suppose, but if it helps… then yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please lie on your back, and I’ll start by listening to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. Bowel sounds are present, though a bit… gassy. Now, I’m going to ask you to bend over, or lie on your side. This next part… will be uncomfortable, but quick. Alright. I didn’t feel any obvious masses or abnormalities, but there was some… mild resistance. Your prostate feels normal size. It’s difficult to say much more without some additional testing.
PATIENT: Okay. That… wasn’t too bad, I suppose. Mild resistance? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Hilber, but it does suggest some… hesitancy. The resistance could be from a few things – maybe some impacted stool, or a slight narrowing of the rectal canal. That's why I want to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool occult blood test, just to rule out any hidden issues. But the main thing I want to do is a colonoscopy. We need to take a look inside to see what's going on. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… My daughter’s been telling me to do that for years. I didn’t want to, but… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Yes, let’s do it. What does it involve? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Alright. It's a good step, Mr. Hilber. The colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum. We use it to visualize the entire colon and look for any polyps, inflammation, or other abnormalities. You will receive sedation to make you comfortable during the procedure, so you likely won't remember much of it. There will be some discomfort afterward, like bloating or cramping, but it’s usually mild. The preparation is the hardest part – you will need to clear your bowels completely before the procedure. The nurses will give you detailed instructions on how to do that. I'll also order a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent. Do you have any questions about the procedure or the preparation?
PATIENT: Anya Sharma… No, I don’t think so. Clearing my bowels… that sounds unpleasant. But if it’s necessary… How long will it take to get an appointment? And… will my insurance cover it? I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover it, Mr. Hilber, especially given your age and symptoms. We'll verify coverage before scheduling anything, just to be sure. As for the appointment, Dr. Sharma’s office is usually pretty busy. It could take a week or two to get an appointment scheduled. The office will contact you directly to set it up. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water a day and adding some fiber-rich foods to your diet – things like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And if you experience any rectal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or a fever, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll… I’ll try to drink more water and eat some more vegetables. And I’ll wait for Dr. Sharma to call. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it’s always better to be proactive about your health. If you have any concerns or questions at any time, don’t hesitate to call my office. Here's a printed summary of our discussion and your orders. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule a follow-up appointment and go over the preparation instructions for your colonoscopy. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
