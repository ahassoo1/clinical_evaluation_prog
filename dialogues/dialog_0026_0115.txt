DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about my coloring, I suppose. My skin… it’s gotten awfully yellow. It’s rather distressing, truthfully. I don’t recall precisely when it started, but my niece noticed it and insisted I come in. She’s a very practical girl, that one. I do have some trouble with my liver, you see. Or… I think I do. It was diagnosed some time ago, but the details… they escape me.
DOCTOR: Yes, yellowing of the skin – we call that jaundice – can certainly be concerning. And it’s good your niece encouraged you to come in. It’s always helpful to have someone looking out for us. You mentioned some trouble with your liver… I understand details can be difficult to recall. Don’t worry about that at all. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me anything at all about that diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a diagnosis. It was… quite a while ago, I’m afraid. I believe it was hepatitis. Or something like hepatitis. I had a doctor then, a very nice man… but he’s retired now, I think. And I haven’t been back regularly since. It involved… tests, of course. And a lot of fatigue. I mostly remember feeling very tired. And… a bit sick to my stomach. But the specifics… they are so very fuzzy. I apologize. I truly do. It's just… time slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: You don’t need to apologize at all, Annelle. Time does slip away, and it's perfectly normal not to remember every detail, especially from something that happened a while ago. Hepatitis is a good place to start. Was it something you contracted suddenly, or was it something that developed over time, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I believe it came on rather suddenly. Or, at least, that’s the impression I have. I remember feeling perfectly fine one day, and then… unwell the next. A bit like a bad flu, perhaps? Though it lingered… much, much longer than a flu. I don’t recall any specific event that might have caused it, if that’s what you’re asking. I wasn’t… travelling or anything like that. Just… normal life. Is that helpful? I do wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Annelle. Sudden onset points us in a particular direction. And not being able to pinpoint a cause isn’t unusual. Let’s talk about your current symptoms. You mentioned feeling unwell, and some fatigue. Is that fatigue still present now?
PATIENT: Yes, the fatigue… it’s a constant companion, I’m afraid. It’s not debilitating, not like it was at one point, but it’s always there, a sort of… weariness. And, well, the yellowing of my skin, of course. That's the main reason I'm here. I also… I haven’t much of an appetite lately. Food just doesn’t seem appealing. And… sometimes my stomach feels a little bloated. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Is that… all relevant? I worry I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Annelle. Everything you're telling me is relevant. It helps me build a complete picture. Loss of appetite and bloating… those are good things to note. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh… changes in my… well, I haven’t paid particularly close attention, I must confess. I suppose… my urine seems normal enough. Perhaps a little darker than usual, now that you mention it. But that could simply be from not drinking enough water, I imagine. As for my… stool… I really haven’t noticed anything unusual. I apologize for my lack of… observation. I’m not a very observant person, I’m afraid. It's probably silly to even ask me such things.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Annelle. Many people don’t routinely check those things. A slightly darker urine color could be due to dehydration, as you said. Now, let’s talk about other medical issues. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides the hepatitis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. That was… a difficult time. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, which is more of a nuisance than anything else. It flares up sometimes, makes it hard to… well, to do things with my hands. But that’s all, I believe. Nothing else that I recall. I've never been a particularly sickly person, despite the… liver trouble. I'm trying to think, but my memory is just… not what it used to be. Perhaps my niece would know better. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal and arthritis… good to know. And it's perfectly alright that you're not certain about everything. We can always reach out to your niece if needed. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just a small dose of something for my arthritis, I think. A white pill, I believe. But it doesn’t seem to do much good, honestly. I can’t recall the name of it. And… that’s it. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. I don’t like the way it makes me feel. I prefer to… manage things on my own, if I can. It's probably silly, but... I worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Annelle. Many people share that concern about side effects. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and I've tried a few different medications over the years, and I've never had any problems. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Though… I do get a bit of a rash sometimes, if I spend too much time in the sun. But that's not an allergy, is it? Just… sensitive skin. I apologize for rambling again. I seem to be doing a lot of that today. I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Annelle. Sensitive skin doesn't count as an allergy. Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I’ve always been very careful about my health, despite the… liver trouble. I eat a fairly healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. And I try to get a bit of exercise whenever I can, though my arthritis makes it difficult sometimes. I just want to live a long and healthy life, if possible. Is that… too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That's not too much to ask at all, Annelle. It sounds like you've been very conscientious about your health. Now, one last thing about your lifestyle. Can you tell me a little bit about where you live and what your home environment is like?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I live in a small house in the country. It's very quiet and peaceful, which I enjoy. I live alone, mostly. My niece visits me often, which is lovely. The house is… well, it's old, and it needs a bit of repair. But it's comfortable enough. I have a small garden, where I grow some of my own vegetables. And I have a cat, a very fluffy Persian named Snowball. He’s my constant companion. It’s a simple life, but it’s a good life. Is that helpful? I do hope I’m not taking up too much of your time. I’m aware I’m not providing much useful information.
DOCTOR: You are providing very useful information, Annelle. It all helps me build a complete picture. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. And I'll take a look at your skin to assess the yellowing. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgement completely. I'll do whatever you think is best. It’s… it's just a little worrying, you know? This yellowing… it’s not something I’ve experienced before. But I have faith in you. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I just want to get to the bottom of this, if possible. And… thank you again for your kindness. You're very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Annelle. It's my pleasure. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: No, nothing feels particularly tender, Doctor. Though… it’s a little uncomfortable, just from… general bloating, I suppose. Nothing sharp or painful, just a bit of pressure. It’s hard to say, really. I’m not very good at describing things. And… please be gentle. My stomach is rather sensitive. I apologize for being such a bother. I just want to be helpful, but I’m afraid I’m not very good at this. Perhaps my niece should have come with me. She’s much better at explaining things.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother at all, Annelle. And it's perfectly alright that you're not sure about things. I'm going to take a look at your skin now. I am noting visible jaundice to the skin and sclera. The jaundice appears moderate in severity. There is no rash or other skin abnormalities noted. Alright, Annelle. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, I think we need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. These tests will help us assess your liver function and determine the cause of the jaundice. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Blood tests sound perfectly sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing all this. I’ve never been one to shy away from tests. I’ve always believed in getting to the bottom of things. And… if it can help me feel better, then I’m all for it. Where will these tests be done? And… will they be painful? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… worry. Perhaps my niece was right to come with me. She always knows what to ask.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Annelle. It's perfectly normal to be concerned. The blood tests will be done right here in the clinic. A phlebotomist will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. It's very quick. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and a bilirubin level. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us pinpoint the cause of the jaundice. It may take a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we can discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. A few days is no problem at all. I have plenty of time. And… thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. You’ve put my mind at ease, I must say. I appreciate your patience with an old woman like me. Will… will these tests tell me if it’s serious? I don’t want to be a bother, but… it’s just that I’ve always been rather healthy, and this… this is all so new. And a little frightening, to be honest. Perhaps my niece should have come with me. She’s much braver than I am.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be frightened, Annelle. It's understandable. The tests will help us determine the seriousness of the situation. Jaundice can be caused by a variety of things, some more serious than others. It could be something relatively minor, or it could indicate a more significant underlying problem. We won't know until we have the results back. I want to be upfront with you: based on your history of hepatitis and the presence of jaundice, it is important to investigate this thoroughly. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious. We'll take it one step at a time. Once we have the results, we can discuss all of your options and develop a plan that's right for you. And you're absolutely right – it would have been helpful to have your niece here. But we're doing just fine, and we can always schedule a follow-up appointment so she can join us if you'd like. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done and taking things one step at a time. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds acceptable, Doctor. One step at a time… that’s what my mother always said. And… you're right. It would be helpful to have my niece at the follow-up. She’s very good at asking questions. I always forget what I want to ask. So… what do I do now? Do I just… wait for the phlebotomist? And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Avoid certain foods? Rest more? I just want to be proactive, if possible. I apologize for being such a bother. I just… worry. Perhaps my niece should have come with me.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother, Annelle. Absolutely not. For now, just wait for the phlebotomist. They will come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, there’s no need to make any drastic changes to your diet or activity level. Just continue to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest, as you’ve been doing. I would recommend avoiding alcohol until we have the test results back. It’s best to err on the side of caution. And if you experience any new symptoms, such as abdominal pain, fever, or changes in your stool color, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I'm going to step out and let the phlebotomist know you’re ready. They will be in shortly. And don't worry, we’ll take good care of you. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all. You’ve answered everything so thoroughly. Thank you… thank you for your kindness and your patience. I appreciate it more than words can say. I… I just hope it’s nothing serious. Perhaps my niece was right to come with me. She always knows what to ask.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Annelle. And it's alright to be anxious. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I'm going to step out now and let the phlebotomist know you're ready. Please just relax, and they'll be in shortly.
