DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s nice to meet you too, I suppose. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get straight to it. I want to have a baby. A healthy baby. And I want to make sure… things work the first time. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’ve had a child before, but… well, let's just say I want to avoid any… complications this time around.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Planning a pregnancy is a great first step, and it's smart to think ahead, especially with a previous pregnancy. It’s good you want to make sure everything is optimal. So, to start, let's talk a little bit about your previous pregnancy. Can you tell me about that – how long ago was it, and were there any issues during or after?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was… twenty years ago, give or take. With my ex-husband. It was… fine. Perfectly normal, as far as I recall. Standard delivery. No complications during – although the recovery was… unpleasant. A bit of tearing, you know. Nothing a woman can’t handle, of course. But I don't want a repeat of that. And honestly, I don't want to spend another nine months feeling… enormous. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all! It's completely reasonable to want a smooth and comfortable pregnancy. Twenty years ago is a good timeframe – things change, and it's good to re-evaluate. Okay, so a standard delivery with some tearing during recovery. We can definitely discuss ways to minimize that risk this time around. Before we get into that though, let’s just get a general health overview. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Heavens, no. I eat very healthily. Mostly. And I certainly don't have… diabetes. I find that absolutely dreadful. No, no conditions. I take a multivitamin, that’s it. Medicare covers it, thankfully. Honestly, I’m in remarkably good shape for my age. I cycle, you know. It’s my profession. Keeps me very… toned. Are we getting anywhere? Because frankly, this feels like a lot of unnecessary questioning.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear – staying active with cycling is excellent. And yes, we are getting there! It's just important to have a complete picture. I see Medicare is your insurance, and you take a multivitamin. Excellent. Now, just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think. I had a reaction to… something… when I was younger. A penicillin derivative, I believe. Made me break out in hives. Dreadful. But that was… decades ago. I haven’t taken anything regularly in years. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, and I’ve never had any trouble with that. Honestly, I’m not a sickly person, Doctor. I simply want to ensure a healthy pregnancy, and I'd appreciate it if we could focus on that. Are we done with the… history taking?
DOCTOR: Okay, a penicillin derivative allergy with hives decades ago, and ibuprofen is okay. Noted. I understand your desire to focus on the pregnancy planning, and we will get there, but this is all important information. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Really? Must we? Honestly, it's a long and depressing story. My mother had… well, she had a weak heart. Passed away when she was… seventy-something. My father… he smoked. A dreadful habit. Lung cancer, naturally. And my aunt… she had some sort of… neurological condition. I can’t even remember what it was. Look, Doctor, there’s a lot of… unpleasantness in my family history. It's not a particularly healthy lineage, shall we say? Is this absolutely necessary? I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s a lot to share, and it doesn't sound like a particularly cheerful family history. It is helpful though, as it can give us some clues about potential risks, and allow us to be proactive. We don’t need to go into exhaustive detail if you’re uncomfortable, but knowing about heart disease, cancer, and the neurological condition helps. Okay, before we move on, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious? I just told you my father smoked, and it led to a dreadful illness! Do I look like someone who would smoke? I cycle professionally! As for alcohol… I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A very small glass. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I find the very idea… appalling. Honestly, Doctor, I lead a very clean and healthy life. This line of questioning is… insulting, frankly. Are we finished yet? I have a bike to repair.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be offended, and I apologize if my questions seemed insulting. It was inappropriate, especially given your lifestyle. I am just trying to be thorough, but I clearly haven't been sensitive enough. Okay, let's move on to something more relevant to your pregnancy planning. Do you have any existing medical conditions, other than the penicillin allergy, and are you currently taking any medications besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: Honestly, you're repeating yourself. I told you. No. No other conditions. Just the allergy. And a multivitamin, covered by Medicare. I feel perfectly healthy, Doctor. Perfectly. And I would like to know what steps we're going to take to ensure a successful pregnancy, rather than being subjected to this… interrogation. Are you going to offer any actual advice, or are we just going to continue dissecting my life history?
DOCTOR: You are right to push me on this, and I apologize again for the repetitive questioning. You are in good health, and I should have moved on sooner. Okay, let’s focus on your pregnancy planning. Since you’ve had a previous pregnancy, we’ll want to ensure everything is optimal for this one. We can start with a physical exam, and I’d like to order some basic blood work to check your overall health, hormone levels, and screen for any potential issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Finally! Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam and blood work. That's what I came here for. As long as it's quick, and doesn’t involve any unnecessary probing into my personal life. And please, ensure the results are expedited. I don’t have time to waste. Let's get on with it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. Let’s get started with the physical exam. We’ll just do a standard check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, weight – and then a quick examination. Okay, your blood pressure is 120/80, which is excellent. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your weight is 86 kilograms. That’s a healthy weight for your height of 186 centimeters. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs… Everything sounds clear and normal so far. Now, let’s take a look at your abdomen… No tenderness or abnormalities detected. Do you have any pain or discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Nothing at all. As I said, perfectly healthy. Are we nearly finished? Honestly, this is taking far too long. I have a customer waiting for a repair. And please, try not to poke too much. I'm a cyclist, you know. I need my core muscles intact.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I'll be very careful. I'm just quickly assessing everything to make sure everything is as it should be. Okay, everything appears normal externally. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. I'll also order a urine analysis. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and formulate a plan to optimize your health for pregnancy. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes. That sounds… acceptable. As long as the results come back quickly, and you don't try to interrogate me further. Just tell me what I need to do. Where is this… lab? And how long will it take? I really must get back to work. This is becoming increasingly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, first door on the right. The technician will take a small blood sample and a urine sample. It should only take about 15-20 minutes, and they'll let me know as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results, likely in a few days. She’s just outside the door if you need anything. To ensure optimal health, I recommend continuing your healthy diet and active lifestyle. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thank you. I think that's quite enough for now. I’ll just… go to this lab. And please, tell your assistant to schedule the appointment for the earliest possible time. I don’t have time to waste. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll do our best to accommodate your schedule. Have a good day, Angelle. And we'll see you soon. .
