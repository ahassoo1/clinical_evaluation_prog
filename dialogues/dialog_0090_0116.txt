DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's… it's my legs, dear. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. Just… a terrible ache. It wakes me up, you see. It’s been going on for… well, a good while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long. Time slips away, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Cramping in your legs, worse at night. And you said it's been going on for a "good while." Could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… That’s a hard one. Let me think… Maybe… three months? Four? It feels like it started around the time the lilacs bloomed, if that helps any. Though, I planted new ones last year, so… I truly can’t be certain. It's not every night, you understand. Just… often enough to be a nuisance. A real nuisance. I have to get up and… well, walk it off, usually. It helps a little.
DOCTOR: Right. So, roughly three to four months. And walking seems to provide some relief. Are the cramps in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both, dear. Both legs. Though sometimes one is worse than the other. It feels… like a knot tightening up, you see? And then… just a searing ache. It’s mostly in the calf, I think. The back of my leg. Though, sometimes it goes up higher, into the… hamstring, is that what it's called? I don’t rightly remember all the names of things. I used to be so good with words, you know. Proofreading, that was my job. But things… fade.
DOCTOR: Yes, the calf and sometimes the hamstring. And you’ve noticed it’s intermittent, comes and goes. Have you noticed anything that makes it better besides walking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Better… Well, sitting with my feet up seems to help a bit. When I can manage it. Though, I’m not always able to get comfortable, you see. It’s a bit of a struggle sometimes. And… a warm bath, perhaps? Though, I haven’t had a good soak in ages. I do drink plenty of water, though. My daughter always tells me to. She's a good girl. Always looking after me. Does that… count for anything? I truly don't know what makes it better. It just… comes and goes, as you said.
DOCTOR: Right. Sitting with your feet elevated and a warm bath may provide some relief. And you stay hydrated. Good. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a question. Well… I don’t think so. I’ve been… remarkably healthy, all my life. A few aches and pains, naturally, at my age. But nothing serious, you see? I had a touch of the flu a few winters back, but I recovered quickly. My heart… the doctor always said it was strong. Though, that was… a long time ago. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. That’s why I need these glasses. But other than that… No, I can't think of anything. I’m a widow, you know. Lost my husband… oh, goodness, it’s been nearly twenty years now. But he was a strong man. Always took care of me. Does that… matter? I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling. Just… providing context. Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Now, there was a time, many years ago, when I had my tonsils out. When I was a little girl. And… oh! When I broke my wrist, falling off a horse! That was a long time ago, too. A silly thing, really. I was just a teenager. Other than that… I don’t believe so. No hospital stays that I can recall. Nothing major, you see? I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Though, luck can change, can’t it? I haven't been to the hospital since then, though. Not for anything serious, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. No medications. Not a one. My daughter… she keeps offering, you know. For my blood pressure, perhaps. But the doctor always said I was fine. Just a little… old. And… I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. So, no, nothing at all. Just water and a bit of tea, mostly. And a little chocolate now and then, if my daughter allows it. She worries about my sugar, you see. But a little chocolate never hurt anyone, did it?
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me think… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I sometimes get a bit of a sniffle when the lilacs are in bloom, but that’s just… springtime, you see? Not a true allergy. And… no, nothing that requires a doctor’s attention. I used to handle a lot of… papers, you know, in my work. Sometimes dusty ones. But that didn’t bother me none. So, no, I don't believe I have any allergies to worry about. Though, one can never be too sure, can they?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any family history of… leg problems, blood clots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a hard one. My family… they weren’t ones for talking about such things, you see. Mostly farmers and fishermen. Strong people, but… not ones for doctors. My mother… she had weak ankles, I remember. Always twisting them. But that wasn’t…leg problems, really. Just clumsiness, I suppose. And my father… he had a bad heart, as I said. But that was a different thing entirely. No, I don’t recall anyone having trouble with their legs, or… clots, as you said. Mostly, they just worked hard and… lived their lives. It wasn’t a family that talked much about… ailments, you see? Does that make sense? It’s hard to recall, after all these years. Things…fade.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Bilstein, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, all right, dear. If you think that’s best. It’s been… a long time since I’ve been examined, you see. But I trust your judgment. Just let me… …carefully now. This old body doesn't move as quickly as it once did. Lead the way, dear. I'll do my best. Is it… cold in there?
DOCTOR: It's room temperature, Ms. Bilstein. Just lie on your back for me, and we'll get started. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please try to breathe deeply. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit faint. Not alarming, but something to keep in mind. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your pulses in both legs.
PATIENT: Oh, all right, dear. Breathing deeply… yes. It's… a little difficult, sometimes. I get… winded, easily. But I'm trying, truly. Faint heart, you say? Well… I'm an old woman, aren't I? As for the pulses… go ahead, dear. I'll try to keep still. Just let me know if I need to… adjust. This table is a bit…hard. I'm not used to such things. It's been ages, you see. Ages since I've had anyone…examine me.
DOCTOR: Your pulses are… a bit weak, especially on the right side. Not dramatically so, but something I need to note. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are… diminished, but not absent. Again, consistent with age. Now, I'm going to gently move your legs and feet. Let me know if anything feels painful. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. Gentle now… That's… a little better than the tapping. My knees… they creak, you know. Always have. That… that feels a little…tight. Not painful, exactly. Just… restricted. I don't move them much these days. It's easier to just… stay still. Restricted… that’s the word, I think. And the ankles… a little stiff, too. I haven’t walked much lately. My daughter… she worries about me falling, you see. So, I stay inside, mostly. It's safer that way. Is something wrong, dear? You seem…concerned.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Bilstein, based on my examination and your history, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with peripheral artery disease, or PAD. Your weak pulses, diminished reflexes, and restricted movement suggest reduced blood flow to your legs. The cramping at night, particularly when walking, is a common symptom. It’s not an emergency, but it is something we need to address. We need to confirm this with some testing. I'd like to order an Ankle-Bracial Index test. It's a non-invasive test that measures the blood pressure in your legs and arms to see how well your arteries are functioning. And a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Peripheral…artery…disease? That sounds…serious. And testing? An…Index? I don’t think I understand, dear. Is it painful? Will it take long? I don’t want to be a bother. And cholesterol… I try to eat healthy, you know. My daughter… she makes sure of it. Blood sugar… I have a bit of a sweet tooth, I confess. Will I need…pills? I truly don’t like pills, dear. You said it wasn't an emergency, but… still. It sounds worrisome. Just what is this disease, exactly? Can it be…fixed? I'm getting flustered now. It's all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein, let’s take this one step at a time. Peripheral artery disease means that the arteries in your legs are narrowed, usually due to a buildup of plaque. It’s common, especially with age. The ABI test is completely painless. It involves placing cuffs on your arms and legs, like when your blood pressure is taken. It takes about 20-30 minutes. As for the blood panel, it’s just a simple blood draw. As for needing pills… we’ll see what the tests show first. If your cholesterol or blood sugar are elevated, medication might be necessary, but we can discuss other options as well. It's not always about pills. Lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, can often help. Now, it’s not necessarily "fixable" in the sense of completely reversing the narrowing of the arteries. But we can manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. That means improving blood flow to your legs, preventing complications, and keeping you as active as possible. Do you understand a little better now?
PATIENT: Oh… cuffs and a blood draw. That doesn't sound too dreadful, I suppose. Though I do get… faint sometimes. I'll need to sit down for that, won’t I? And lifestyle… changes. Diet and exercise… At my age? It's been so long. I don’t think I have the energy, dear. But… if it will help… I suppose I can try. Slowing down the progression… that sounds… sensible. So, no pills right away? That’s… a relief. Still, it all sounds very worrisome, you see. And… complicated. My daughter is very good with these things, though. I'll have to tell her about all this. She’ll know what to do. So, the cuffs and the blood draw… and then we wait for the results? How long will that take? And… what if the results are…bad? I'm getting anxious again. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Yes, cuffs and a blood draw. And then we wait for the results. The lab usually takes a few days to get everything back to us. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, probably in about a week. Now, if the results are concerning, it doesn't necessarily mean that you need drastic treatment. We'll discuss all your options, including medication, lifestyle changes, and potentially a referral to a vascular specialist if necessary. And truthfully, Ms. Bilstein, it's perfectly understandable to be anxious. But try not to worry too much until we have the results. We’re going to take this one step at a time. In the meantime, try to stay as active as you can, even if it's just a short walk around the house. And I’ll write up a referral for the ABI and the blood work. My nurse will schedule those tests for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… short walks. I suppose I can manage that. My daughter will be pleased. And… a vascular specialist? That sounds…serious. But you said one step at a time. I’ll try to remember that. Yes, the nurse will schedule the tests. That’s good. I don’t think I could manage all that myself right now. Let me see… questions… Well… will this… affect my life much? Will I still be able to… visit my friends? I enjoy my book club, you see. And… will it be painful? That’s my biggest worry, I think. The pain. I can manage a little discomfort, but… I don't want to be in constant pain. Is that a possibility? And… is it contagious? My friends would be very worried if it was contagious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein, let's address those questions one by one. It's unlikely that this will significantly affect your daily life, especially if we catch it early and manage it properly. It’s very unlikely to affect your ability to visit friends or attend your book club. As for pain, that’s a valid concern. It’s possible to experience pain, especially during exercise, but we can manage that with medication and lifestyle changes. We'll do everything we can to minimize your discomfort. And no, it is absolutely not contagious. It's a condition related to your blood vessels, not an infection. Now, I think we’ve covered everything for today. My nurse will come in shortly to schedule the tests and go over the discharge instructions with you. Please, try not to worry too much. We’re going to monitor your condition closely and do everything we can to keep you as comfortable and active as possible. Do you have any questions before my nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Oh… not contagious. That’s a relief. My friends would be very worried if it was. And not affecting my book club… that’s good too. I wouldn't want to miss that. I… I think that’s all, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Although… a bit overwhelming, if I'm honest. But I trust you, Doctor. And I’m glad I came in. My daughter will be very pleased that I did. Yes, the nurse can come in now. I’ll just sit here and… wait. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And for not…laughing at all my questions.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Bilstein. I'll have the nurse come in now. Try to relax, and don't hesitate to call if you have any further questions.
