DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the faintest idea why my… representative scheduled this appointment. I am a perfectly capable man. But, if you must know, it’s the students. Utterly dreadful. No respect for knowledge anymore. Just… noise. And the paperwork! It’s… excessive. I suppose that’s it. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Schlatterer, while I appreciate your… candor, that doesn't quite sound like a medical complaint. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical? Good heavens, no. I’m not ill. Just… fatigued. From dealing with… them. My head aches sometimes, but that’s probably just the poor quality of the books they’re reading these days. It’s quite draining, you understand. A man of my intellect… it takes a toll. Is there a form for this? I’d really like to just fill something out and be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to be a bit more specific. You mentioned fatigue and headaches. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. A long time, I suppose. Years, perhaps? It comes and goes. Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep a log of my… discomforts. I have books to catalogue, you know. Important work. It’s hard to pinpoint… everything blends together, you see? It's always something with those students. Truly dreadful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's see… according to your records, you haven’t had a full physical in… some time. I’m going to need to ask you a few questions about your medical history, just to get a baseline. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Really, Doctor. I've lived a perfectly respectable life. A few… aches and pains, naturally. What man my age doesn't have those? But no, no diagnoses. I recall a bout of… something unpleasant when I was stationed in… somewhere. But it was nothing serious. A minor ailment. The paperwork from that is probably lost by now. Honestly, I have a terrible memory for such things. More concerned with Dewey Decimal, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. There was… a rather unfortunate incident with a shelving unit, many years ago. Fell, you see. Quite embarrassing. But it wasn’t serious. A few bruises, a sprained wrist, perhaps. They patched me up and sent me on my way. No need for a prolonged stay, naturally. I had books to get back to. Honestly, I wouldn’t have time for such frivolities. Is this really necessary, Doctor? I have a lecture to prepare.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no. Both gone, years ago. My father was… a stern man. Very little time for pleasantries. My mother… she worried a lot. A nervous disposition, you see. She always said I was too dedicated to my work. Honestly, I don’t recall much about their… ailments. It was a long time ago. They weren't… robust individuals. That much I remember. Is there a quickest way to complete this questionnaire, Doctor? I assure you, my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Let’s try a different approach. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Medications? Goodness, no. I’m a perfectly healthy man! I rely on strong tea and a disciplined mind, not… pills. I wouldn’t dream of polluting my system with such things. It’s probably best to keep things natural, you see? Honestly, Doctor, are you implying something is wrong with me? I assure you, I am quite… functional. Now, if you'll excuse me… this is rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, you came to see me. While I understand your… reluctance to discuss these matters, it's difficult to assess your well-being without a complete picture. Now, let's talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: My diet? Honestly, Doctor, are you now questioning my lifestyle choices? I eat… appropriately. I have a light breakfast, usually toast and tea. Lunch is often a sandwich at my desk – time is of the essence, you see. And dinner… well, whatever is prepared. I am not a particularly fussy eater. I focus on mental nourishment, not… frivolous delicacies. Is this truly relevant? I came here because someone insisted, not because I believe I require… a dietary assessment. Frankly, I find this line of questioning… insulting. I think I’ve had enough of this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration, but I am trying to gather information. You’ve mentioned fatigue and headaches, and you're reluctant to provide any details about your lifestyle or medical history. Given your age, and the lack of recent medical check-ups, I strongly recommend we proceed with some basic blood work and a neurological evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It's a precaution, nothing more. If you refuse, I can document that as well. But I advise against it. I'm concerned. Now, do you consent to these tests?
