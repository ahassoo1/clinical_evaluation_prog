DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Grumman is the name. This… tiredness. It’s been a long time now. Not like a normal tired, you understand? It’s… inside tired. Like the engine is slow. And the other doctor… he said something about my liver. Not a good thing, I think.
DOCTOR: “Inside tired,” alright. And this other doctor… do you recall which doctor said something about your liver?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Old man… Henderson. Yes, Henderson. Down by the market. He poked around, did some tests… papers, you know? Said something about it not working right. I don’t remember what exactly, just that it sounded… bad. He told me to see someone… a specialist, maybe? That’s why I’m here. It was… six months ago, maybe? Time gets lost.
DOCTOR: Six months ago… alright. And you said this tiredness has been going on for a long time?
PATIENT: A long time. More than a year, I think. It comes and goes, but mostly… it’s just there. Makes it hard to do things. Even walking feels… heavy. My wife, she does most of the work now. She complains, naturally. I used to be strong. Worked with the fabrics, all day long. Now… not so much. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. And this tiredness… is it worse at a certain time of day?
PATIENT: Not really. It’s… always there, just different. In the morning, it’s like trying to pull myself out of mud. Afternoon… a little better, maybe. But by evening? I just want to sit. And then I don't sleep good. Wake up more tired than when I went to bed. It's a circle, you see? A bad circle. And my appetite… it’s gone. Everything tastes like… nothing.
DOCTOR: A bad circle, yes. Loss of appetite as well… and have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Skin? What do you mean? It’s… old skin. I’m not young, Doctor. A little dry, maybe. My wife keeps putting lotion on me. But other than that… no. It doesn't itch, doesn’t change color. Just… old. And thin. Like fabric that’s been worn too much. Is that what you mean? I don't know much about skin. I work with the material, not on it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any pain, anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not sharp, not like a cut. More like a… ache. Right here, under my ribs. Comes and goes. When I eat too much, it feels worse. Or if I bend over. Not every day, though. I just… ignore it. What good does complaining do? It's just an old body, getting older. I've had aches and pains my whole life. This one is just… different. Dull. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you step onto the table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… be quick, if you could. I don't like being poked and prodded. Always feels like a waste of time, if you ask me. But… do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a little… distant. And your breathing is relatively clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel painful?
PATIENT: Oof. Yes. That’s… not good. A little tender, yes. Right there. Feels… swollen, maybe? Not hard, just… full. Like a balloon. Careful, Doctor. Don’t press too hard. It’s… unpleasant. My wife says I’ve gotten bigger around the middle, but I didn’t pay much attention. She always complains about something. But… that hurts. Definitely hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. I noticed some slight tenderness there as well. And a little bit of… fullness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are… diminished. A little slower than I'd expect. Okay, Mr. Grumman. Based on what you've told me and what I've found in the exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of liver issues. The tenderness in your abdomen, the diminished reflexes, and your fatigue are all consistent with that. However, it could be a number of things. We need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? I don't like this, Doctor. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve taken some things over the years… for the aches, the cough. Nothing bad, just… old remedies. My wife brings them. She’s always buying something. I don’t remember what’s in them. Probably herbs. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything. But if you have to give me something, tell me what it is first. I don’t want to be surprised. This all sounds… serious. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Mr. Grumman, but it needs to be investigated. The blood tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and whether your liver is functioning properly. We'll be checking your liver enzymes, your bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. I'll need to draw a few vials of blood. It will only take a few minutes. And I will, of course, tell you exactly what we are testing for. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Doesn’t matter, Doctor. Just… get it over with. Left arm is fine, I suppose. I used to have strong arms, working with the fabric. Now… they’re just arms. And be quick about it, if you could. I don't like needles. And tell me… if it is my liver… what does that mean? Is it… fixable? My wife will be very upset if it’s something serious. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Left arm it is. Now, this will sting for a moment. Just relax your arm. There we go. All done. Just a little pressure for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. As for what it means… if it is your liver, it could be a number of things. It could be something simple, like fatty liver disease, which is often reversible with diet and lifestyle changes. Or it could be something more serious, like hepatitis or cirrhosis. We won't know until we get the results back. I'll send these to the lab right away, and we should have the results within a few days. I’ll have my nurse call you with the findings, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Cirrhosis? That sounds… bad. Very bad. My wife’s uncle had that. He… didn't last long. So… you’re saying I might have what he had? Is it… contagious? Can I give it to her? And… what about the work? I need to work. I have bills to pay. Can I still work if I have… this? That's… a lot to take in. I don't understand all of this. Just… tell me what I need to do. Drink water, you said? And… no alcohol. That's easy enough. But what about everything else? What if it’s serious? I need to know. My wife will want to know. She’ll be asking questions. I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, please. Let's not jump to conclusions. I said we need to investigate. Cirrhosis is just one possibility, and a rather severe one. There are many other reasons for liver problems. We don’t have enough information to say anything definitively yet. And no, it’s not generally contagious. As for work… it's too early to say whether you'll need to adjust your activities. That will depend on the results of the tests. I understand your concerns about bills and your wife, but we need to take this one step at a time. For now, focus on drinking plenty of water and avoiding alcohol. And please, try to remain calm. Worrying won’t help anything. My nurse will call you with the results as soon as they’re available. We’ll discuss everything in detail then, and I’ll be happy to answer any questions your wife may have. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
