DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s about… a surgery. I’m hoping to get cleared for it. It’s… cosmetic, I believe. My late husband arranged it, actually. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be, so I don’t recall all the specifics. But it has something to do with… improving my appearance.
DOCTOR: I see. Cosmetic surgery, arranged by your late husband. That is…unusual, but not unheard of. It's good you’re being proactive about following through with it. However, “clearing” someone for elective surgery requires a bit more information than simply a desire to proceed. To start, could you tell me the type of surgery?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the type… That’s… difficult. He was very particular, and handled all the arrangements. I believe it involved… my face? Perhaps my nose? Or cheeks? I truly apologize for not being more helpful. It was a long time ago, and… well, grief does things to one’s memory, you understand. He just said it would make me feel better about myself. Is there perhaps a record of it somewhere? With the clinic, maybe?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that details are hazy given the circumstances, Ms. Brightful. Grief does have a considerable impact. Let’s see if we can locate any records. I'm accessing your electronic health record now... Brightful, Mackenzi… August 2, 2025… Ah. Here we are. It appears your late husband consulted with Dr. Eleanor Vance, a plastic surgeon, on July 15, 2024. The planned procedure was a rhinoplasty and bilateral buccal fat removal. Do those terms sound familiar?
PATIENT: Rhinoplasty… and… buccal… oh my. That does sound familiar, now that you say it. He mentioned something about the shape of my nose and… making my face look less round. He thought… he thought I looked too tired, I think. It’s all coming back in bits and pieces. Dr. Vance, you said? Yes, that name… I vaguely remember a consultation. But it was such a blur. So, those are the surgeries I’m hoping to… to get cleared for?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Rhinoplasty – reshaping the nose – and buccal fat removal – reducing the fat pads in the cheeks to create a more sculpted appearance. Now, before we discuss “clearing” you for the procedure, it’s important to assess your overall health and suitability. Have you had any medical issues since that consultation with Dr. Vance, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Medical issues… let me see. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter, but that was all treated by my primary care physician. No lasting effects, thankfully. And…oh! I did sprain my ankle a few months back, gardening, but it healed well. Other than that… I think I've been quite healthy, all things considered. I try to stay active, you see. It helps with… well, everything.
DOCTOR: Flu and a sprained ankle… good. No chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, no chronic conditions. Nothing that I'm aware of, Doctor. My late husband always took such good care of my health, scheduled all my appointments. It’s just… been different since. I don't believe I have any allergies either, not that I know of. And I don’t take any regular medications.
DOCTOR: Very good. No allergies, no chronic conditions, no regular medications. That's a positive starting point. Now, to proceed, I need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll assess your cardiovascular health, lung function, and then examine the area where the surgeries are planned – your nose and cheeks. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly acceptable. I want to be sure I’m healthy enough for this. Whatever you need, just let me know. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your judgement completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll please have a seat on the examination table. I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but within normal limits for your age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s take a look at your face… There is some mild asymmetry in your nostrils, and the buccal fat pads are somewhat prominent, as expected. No signs of prior surgery or infection. Skin turgor is good. Overall, you appear to be in good physical condition for elective surgery, but your weight is slightly elevated. BMI is 36.2, which places you in the obese category. This can increase the risk of complications during and after surgery.
PATIENT: Oh… My weight? I… I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. It’s been difficult, adjusting to life without… Is it a significant problem, Doctor? Will it prevent me from having the surgery? I understand risks are involved, and I want to be realistic. I just… I was hoping this might help me feel a little more like myself again. What would you recommend?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a prevention of the surgery, Ms. Brightful, but it does increase your risk profile. Specifically, a higher BMI can lead to increased bleeding during surgery, slower wound healing, and a higher risk of infection. Furthermore, it may affect the aesthetic outcome, as excess fat can obscure the results of the surgery. I would recommend consulting with a nutritionist to develop a weight management plan before proceeding with the surgery. Even a modest weight loss of 5-10% can significantly reduce your risk. I can provide you with a referral to a qualified nutritionist in the area. We also need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your weight gain, such as hypothyroidism. I recommend a thyroid panel. Would you be agreeable to those two steps – nutrition consultation and thyroid panel – before scheduling the surgery?
PATIENT: A nutritionist and a thyroid panel… yes, that sounds… sensible. I want to do everything I can to ensure a good outcome and minimize the risks, of course. How long would it take, approximately, to get those things done? And… would that mean a significant delay in the surgery itself? I understand it's for the best, but I was hoping to have this completed sooner rather than later. It's just… it's been a long time coming.
DOCTOR: I understand your eagerness, Ms. Brightful. The nutritionist consultation typically takes about an hour, and they'll develop a personalized plan for you. As for the thyroid panel, we can order that today and have the results back within 2-3 business days. Depending on the outcome of the thyroid panel, and your progress with the nutrition plan – even starting the plan shows commitment – we can reassess your suitability for surgery in approximately 4-6 weeks. This isn't about delaying the surgery unnecessarily. It’s about ensuring your safety and maximizing the chances of a successful outcome. We want to do this right, don't we?
PATIENT: You're right, Doctor. We do. Safety is paramount. 4-6 weeks… I can do that. A nutrition plan and a thyroid panel. It seems… manageable. Yes, let’s proceed with those steps. Please, give me the referrals. I’ll schedule appointments as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. It’s just…it’s been such a long process. It’s nice to feel like we’re finally moving forward, even if it’s at a slower pace.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Brightful. I am printing out the referrals for Dr. Anya Sharma, a registered dietitian, and the lab order for the thyroid panel. Dr. Sharma's office is located on Elm Street. The lab is located within the hospital, just down the hall. I will also send a summary of today's consultation to your primary care physician. Do you have any questions about the referrals or the lab order?
PATIENT: Elm Street… yes, I think I know where that is. No, I don't think so. Everything seems quite clear. Sending a summary to my primary care physician is a thoughtful touch, thank you. I suppose… that’s all for today, then? Thank you again, Doctor Paraskevopoulos. I appreciate your thoroughness and… your patience. It’s… a relief to have a plan in place.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I'm glad I could provide some clarity and direction. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. We're here to help. I wish you all the best with the nutrition consultation and the thyroid panel. I look forward to seeing you in 4-6 weeks to discuss the results. Have a pleasant day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I’m sure I will see you then. You have a pleasant day as well. .
