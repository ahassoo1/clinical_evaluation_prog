DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um, it’s about my balance, I think. I’ve been feeling… unsteady. It’s hard to explain, honestly. It’s not a constant thing, but it’s concerning. I don't… really remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually noticing it more, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It is hard to pinpoint sometimes. "Gradually noticing it more" is a good way to describe it. So it's intermittent, comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It doesn't happen all the time. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and other days… well, I feel like I might fall over. It's a bit frightening, to be honest. I mostly notice it when I'm walking, or trying to stand for long periods. Though… I work on a rig, so I do move around quite a bit. Perhaps that makes it harder to tell?
DOCTOR: I understand that’s concerning, especially with your job. Working on a rig definitely adds another layer to it. So it’s more noticeable with activity, but you do experience it even on days when you’re not as active?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s… less pronounced on quiet days, but it’s still there, sometimes. A sort of… lightness, I guess? Like I’m not quite grounded. I… I keep having to check myself, to make sure I'm standing properly. It’s just… unsettling. And I… I lost my husband a while back, and things haven't been quite the same since. I don't know if that… if that has anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Lilyanna. Grief can absolutely manifest in physical ways, and it's important to consider all aspects of your well-being. We'll definitely keep that in mind. So, besides this "lightness" feeling, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Not really, not that I’ve noticed, specifically. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy, but I often work with loud machinery, so I assumed it was just that. And… well, I've been rather tired lately, but I work long shifts, so… It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn't. I do get headaches, occasionally, but those are usually stress-related. I'm… honestly, I’m not very good at remembering these things. Is there a specific kind of symptom I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it can be difficult to pinpoint things. No worries at all. Let’s try this: have you had any changes in your vision—blurriness, double vision, spots?
PATIENT: Changes in vision… No, I don’t think so. My vision feels… normal. I had my eyes checked a few years ago, and everything was fine then. I haven't noticed any blurriness or spots. I do wear glasses for reading, but that’s been the same for quite some time. I mostly notice things up close, though, as my job doesn't require much detailed sight. Does that make sense? I'm… I hope I'm being helpful. I just feel a bit lost, trying to explain all this.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Lilyanna. It's all good information. And no, you’re not feeling lost, you're doing a great job. Okay, so no changes in vision. Have you experienced any ringing in your ears, or any hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… Sometimes, yes. But, like I said, I work around very loud equipment all the time. It's usually after a particularly noisy shift. It goes away after a while, and I always wear ear protection, as much as possible. I haven’t noticed any… significant hearing loss, though. I can still hear perfectly fine, as far as I’m aware. It's just… the ringing is common, given the nature of my work. Is that something we should be concerned about, or is it just a consequence of the job?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point, and it's important to consider the occupational aspect. We will definitely take that into account. Let’s shift gears a little. Have you had any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. My arms and legs feel… normal. I do get rather sore after a long shift, as you can imagine, but that’s just muscle ache. Nothing… unusual. I haven't had any weakness either. I can walk and move around as usual. Though, perhaps I am a bit slower these days, but I chalk that up to… well, getting older. I turned twenty-three last month, but I still feel it sometimes. Is that a silly thing to say?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all! Twenty-three is still young, and it's perfectly normal to feel a bit slower after physically demanding work. Alright, good to know. Have you had any headaches, dizziness, or any trouble with your balance when you change positions – like standing up quickly?
PATIENT: Yes! Actually… yes, that happens sometimes. If I stand up too quickly, I do get a bit dizzy. And sometimes I feel a bit lightheaded. It doesn’t last long, but it’s definitely there. I usually just hold onto something until it passes. I hadn’t really thought much of it, to be honest. I just figured it was… low blood sugar, maybe? Or perhaps dehydration? I try to drink plenty of water, but… it happens. Does that sound like something important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is definitely important information, Lilyanna. Feeling dizzy or lightheaded when changing positions is something we need to investigate. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don't think so. I was checked over pretty thoroughly when I started working on the rig, and they didn't find anything. I don't have diabetes, I don't think. My blood pressure was fine then, too. I… honestly, I don’t remember much about the specifics. They just said I was healthy enough to work. And… well, my husband used to handle all the medical appointments and paperwork. After he passed… it all became a bit blurry. I do have private insurance, though. That’s something, at least. I'm… sorry, I'm not very helpful with this.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Lilyanna. It's completely understandable that things are a bit blurry, especially with everything you’ve been through. And having private insurance is great. Okay, no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. I’ve never had any… serious injuries or anything that required an operation. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, like chickenpox, but nothing major. I’m… fairly healthy, as far as I know. I try to eat well and get enough sleep when I can. It’s just… this unsteadiness is worrying me. It’s not something I’ve ever experienced before. And… well, I work with heavy machinery, and I don’t want to put anyone in danger. That’s the main thing, really.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of you, Lilyanna. Your safety and the safety of others is important. Okay, no surgeries, no known medical conditions. Now, thinking about your family—do you have a family history of any medical conditions, like heart disease, stroke, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some problems with his heart, later in life. But I don’t know the specifics. We weren't very close, and they both passed away a long time ago. I don't really have any other family members to ask about medical history. I was raised in an orphanage, mostly. So, I don’t have much information about my family background. I’m… sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. Is this going to make it difficult to figure out what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: You are not at all unhelpful, Lilyanna. You've given me a lot of valuable information, and it’s completely understandable that your family history is limited. We can still work with what we have. Okay, now let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don’t take any medications. I try to avoid them if possible. I've always been quite healthy, and I prefer to rely on natural remedies if I need something. Mostly just plenty of rest and hydration. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, and nothing long-term. Is that… a problem? Should I be taking something? I'm… I'm not sure what to expect from all this.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Lilyanna. It's good you’re generally healthy and prefer a natural approach. Okay, no medications. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I’ve never had a problem with any medications. I do get mosquito bites easily, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I’m… sorry, I’m probably asking silly questions. I just want to make sure I’m giving you all the correct information. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: You're not asking silly questions at all, Lilyanna. You're being very thorough, and I appreciate that. No allergies. Okay, perfect. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and doing some balance tests. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I just want to figure out what's causing this unsteadiness. It's been rather unsettling, to be honest. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’ll try to be as still as possible. Is there anything specific I need to do during the exam?
DOCTOR: Excellent. No, just relax as much as possible. I’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate, then listen to your lungs. After that, we’ll do a few simple tests to check your balance and coordination. Blood pressure is good, 120 over 80. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to stand up slowly… and just stand here for a moment. Let me know if you feel dizzy or lightheaded. How are you feeling so far?
PATIENT: Standing up felt… okay. A little bit wobbly, perhaps, but nothing major. It’s a bit strange, honestly. It’s not a sudden dizziness, more like a… lightness. I do feel a bit unsteady, but it’s not enough to make me fall. I just feel a bit off-balance. It's… hard to describe. It’s a subtle feeling, but it’s definitely there. I’m trying to focus on a point across the room to steady myself. Is that normal? Should I be holding onto something? It’s… a bit unsettling, to be honest. I’m a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of it and are using a focal point to steady yourself. That’s a helpful strategy. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms straight out in front of you. Okay, now I’m going to ask you to walk a straight line, heel to toe, for about ten steps. If you need to, hold onto the wall for support. How did that feel?
PATIENT: Closing my eyes… felt a bit strange. I definitely felt more unsteady then. It was hard to keep my balance, and I had to concentrate very hard. I could feel myself drifting a bit, as you said. I don't think I could have done more than a few steps without falling over. It was… unsettling, to be honest. Walking a straight line… felt difficult. It was hard to keep my balance, and I had to concentrate very hard on each step. I could feel myself wobbling a bit, and I definitely had to slow down. I didn't fall, but it wasn't easy. It felt like my feet weren't quite coordinating with my brain. Is that normal? Should I be worried now? I’m starting to get a bit anxious, to be honest. This is more concerning than I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. Thank you for letting me know. What we're seeing – the slight unsteadiness, the difficulty with balance, and the slight drift when your eyes are closed – does suggest there could be a problem with your balance system. It’s good we’re investigating. Given your symptoms, and what I've observed during the exam, I'd like to order some further testing. Specifically, I'd like to get a blood test to check for any underlying medical conditions, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. Also, I'd like to refer you to a specialist – a neurologist – for a more thorough evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… MRI and a neurologist… That sounds… serious. Is it something really bad? I mean, is it something I should be worried about? I… I'm starting to get quite anxious, to be honest. I don't like the sound of all these tests. But… if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then I suppose so. Yes, please, do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to know what’s causing this unsteadiness. It’s been very unsettling, and I want to get it sorted out as soon as possible. What does the MRI involve? And what will the neurologist do? Is it going to be painful? I'm… I'm a bit frightened now, to be honest. Please, tell me everything.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling frightened, Lilyanna. It’s natural to be worried when you don’t know what’s going on. I want to assure you that ordering these tests doesn't necessarily mean it’s something serious. These are just precautionary steps to rule out potential causes and get a clearer picture of what’s happening. The MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging – is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It's completely painless. You'll lie on a table, and a machine will scan your head. It can be a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. We’ll provide earplugs to help with the noise. As for the neurologist, they are a specialist in the nervous system – the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. They will conduct a more detailed neurological examination – checking your reflexes, coordination, balance, and sensory function. They may also order additional tests, if necessary. I’m going to write you a referral for the neurologist, and I’ll get the lab order for the blood tests. We’ll get those scheduled as quickly as possible. I’ll also give you a pamphlet with more information about both tests. In the meantime, try to stay calm and avoid activities that make you feel unsteady. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That sounds… less frightening than I thought, I suppose. No needles or anything? Just lying still? That’s… manageable. And no sudden changes… I’ll try to be careful. Um… what about driving? Is it safe for me to drive while I’m waiting for these tests? I do have to drive to work, and I don’t want to put anyone in danger. And… what if the neurologist finds something serious? What kind of treatments are there? I’m… I’m starting to get overwhelmed, to be honest. I just want to get back to normal. Is that too much to ask? And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it very much. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed, Lilyanna. It’s a lot to take in. And yes, asking to get back to normal is not too much to ask. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on and get you the best possible care. Regarding driving, I would advise against it until we have a clearer understanding of what’s causing your unsteadiness. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Perhaps you could arrange for someone to drive you to work for the time being?
PATIENT: Okay… I can ask my colleague to give me a ride. That’s… manageable. And what about the neurologist appointment? How long will it take to get an appointment? And… what kind of questions will they ask me? I'm… worried I won't remember everything. My memory hasn't been the best lately, as you know. And… is there anything I can do to help speed up the diagnosis? Any tests I can take at home? Anything I can avoid? I just want to be proactive, you know? I don't want to just sit here and wait. I want to be doing something. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience. I know I'm asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Lilyanna. It’s good that you’re being proactive, and I’m happy to answer anything you’re concerned about. The neurologist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. It can take a few weeks, unfortunately, as they’re usually quite busy. Once you have an appointment, they’ll likely ask you about your medical history, your symptoms, and any medications you’re taking. They'll also perform a neurological examination, as we discussed. There isn't much you can do at home to speed up the diagnosis directly, unfortunately. The most important thing is to avoid any activities that make your symptoms worse. It might also be helpful to keep a symptom diary – noting when your symptoms occur, how long they last, and any factors that seem to trigger them. This could be helpful for the neurologist. Also, it’s important to get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and stay hydrated. These are always good things, regardless of what’s going on. I'm going to write down the neurologist’s contact information and the website for their office. I'll also include some information about symptom diaries. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That’s… helpful. A symptom diary… I can do that. I suppose it’s better than just sitting here and worrying. Um… is there anything I should be worried about specifically? Any signs or symptoms that I should look out for that would indicate a more serious problem? I know you said it could be nothing, but… I can’t help but worry. And… thank you again, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very kind and patient. I really appreciate it. I feel a little bit better now, knowing that I’m doing something to figure out what’s going on. I think… that’s all for now. I’ll take these notes and try to schedule an appointment with the neurologist as soon as possible. I’ll also start keeping a symptom diary. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It’s completely understandable that you’re worried, and I’m glad I could ease your mind a little bit. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – such as weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, severe headache, vision changes, or loss of consciousness – please go to the emergency room immediately. These could indicate a more serious problem that needs immediate attention. Otherwise, just focus on keeping yourself safe and comfortable, and try to stay positive. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll work together to get you back to normal. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care, Lilyanna, and please don’t worry too much. We’ll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I… I appreciate everything. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Lilyanna. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
