DOCTOR: Right, Courtnye HAINLEY. 47 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my bruising. It's… worse than usual. I'm on a blood thinner, so I get some, but lately, it's been a lot more, and popping up with just…nothing. Like I'll just look at myself wrong and bam, another one. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Blood thinner, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Warfarin, I think it is. Been on it for… oh, goodness, maybe five years now? Since the DVT. I don't always keep track of dates perfectly, but five years sounds right. It’s usually pretty steady, but this has been going on for about a month, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said "popping up with nothing?
PATIENT: Yeah, like… I haven’t done anything! No falls, no bumps, nothing I can think of. Just… there they are. Mostly on my arms and legs, but I even had one on my back last week that I needed my sister to help me with. It's just… unusual, and I’m starting to get a bit nervous. I don’t want to end up in hospital, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And are these bruises… larger than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely. And they seem to stay around longer, too. Usually, they fade pretty quick, but these ones are… stubborn. Like, a week and they're still pretty dark. And sore, which is new. It's not awful pain, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any bleeding elsewhere?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Not really. My gums might be a little more sensitive when I brush, but nothing major. And maybe a few more nosebleeds than usual, but I live in a dry climate, so that could just be that, you know? Nothing dripping all over the place or anything. Just… small stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s take a look. Can you roll up your sleeves, please?
PATIENT: Sure. Here you go. As you can see... it’s not just a few. And like I said, this is after a pretty quiet week!
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, these are…significant. And they do appear quite widespread. Do you notice any swelling or warmth around any of them?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes, a little. Especially if I use my arm a lot. But no real warmth, no. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It's mostly just… discoloration and a bit of tenderness. It's not throbbing or anything, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said you've been on Warfarin for five years?
PATIENT: Yeah, about five years. Since the blood clot in my leg. I get my levels checked regularly, I think? They send me for blood tests every few months, and the doctor always adjusts the dose if it’s too high or low. I haven't had any issues until this started happening. I’m just worried something’s changed, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s quickly check your recent INR results, if we have them here. ...Hmm. Last INR was three weeks ago, and it was… within the therapeutic range. Not drastically high, not low. But still, with this level of bruising, it’s concerning. Do you take any other medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just my usual blood pressure medication, lisinopril, I think it is. And a multivitamin, every morning. Oh, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once a month if that. Nothing else regularly. I definitely don’t take anything herbal or anything like that. I’m pretty careful with that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. Those can thin the blood, too. And the fact it’s been a month… it's something to consider. We need to rule out anything serious. There are a few possibilities we need to investigate. I'm going to order some blood work, a complete blood count and a coagulation panel, just to make sure there aren't any underlying issues. We should also do a basic metabolic panel. It's just routine, but it's important. And I want to rule out any possible internal bleeding.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. Internal bleeding? That sounds scary. Is that likely? I mean, if it was internal bleeding, wouldn’t I feel something? I feel okay, generally. A bit tired, but that’s just normal, right?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s unlikely to be significant internal bleeding, but we always have to consider everything. Sometimes, internal bleeding doesn't present with obvious symptoms initially. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with someone on a blood thinner. The tests will give us a clear picture of what’s going on. I’m also going to recommend you see a hematologist. They specialize in blood disorders and can provide a more detailed assessment. Do you have any known allergies I need to be aware of?
PATIENT: Hematologist? Okay… That sounds…serious. I guess if you think it’s necessary. Allergies? No, not really. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish, but nothing major. Never had a full-blown reaction. And I'm not allergic to any medications, as far as I know. I really hope this isn’t anything serious. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant allergies. Good. The lab orders are sent, and I’ll get the referral to a hematologist processed immediately. They should be in touch to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, avoid any activities that could cause injury, and absolutely no ibuprofen. If you experience any severe headaches, dizziness, weakness, or notice any blood in your stool or urine, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. No ibuprofen, got it. And… headaches, dizziness, weakness, blood… yes, I understand. It sounds… a lot. I really appreciate you being thorough. I just… I worry a lot. This whole thing is just making me anxious. When should I expect to hear from the hematologist? And how long will it take to get the lab results back?
DOCTOR: The hematologist’s office will contact you within a week or so to schedule an appointment. As for the lab results, it typically takes 24-48 hours. They’ll be sent to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as I have them. Look, I understand you're anxious, but it's important to remain calm. Most likely, it’s a minor adjustment to your Warfarin dosage needed. But we’re covering all bases. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, for now. I just… I really hope it is just a minor adjustment. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I'll… I'll wait for the hematologist to call. And I definitely won’t take any ibuprofen. Thank you again.
