DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Good morning to you too, Doctor. I... something about learning? My husband said I need to learn some things. He thinks I don't know enough. About… stuff. I don't really remember what stuff, just that he made the appointment. It's all very… confusing.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it’s not uncommon to feel a little overwhelmed when bringing up concerns. While I appreciate your husband’s attentiveness, my role is to assess your health needs, Ms. Fontanazza. Perhaps we can start with a general overview. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms—anything physically bothering you, or any changes in your mental state, like difficulty with memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Concentration? Oh, I always have trouble with that. Like I said, I forget things. A lot of things. But… physically? Not really. I mean, I get tired easily. Working with the metal all day... it's heavy work. And my back aches sometimes, but that's just… old age, I guess. I'm not that young anymore.
DOCTOR: "Old age," as you put it, is a relative term, Ms. Fontanazza. Thirty-three is certainly not old. Fatigue and back pain can be attributed to a number of things, though. Could you tell me more about the “metal work” you do?
PATIENT: Sheet metal. I cut it, bend it, put it together… for buildings. You know, the stuff that makes the walls and the roofs? It's… hot work. Lots of lifting. And it’s noisy! Always noisy. Makes it hard to think, even before I forget everything. My husband says I complain too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is demanding work, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds as though it presents several physical challenges. The noise, in particular, could certainly contribute to difficulty with concentration. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any difficulty hearing conversations?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe. Sometimes. It's… hard to tell. It's always so loud where I work, I just thought it was… the usual noise. Like a constant hum, you know? Not really ringing, more like… everything is muffled.
DOCTOR: That’s quite common with prolonged exposure to loud noises. It sounds like you may have some degree of noise-induced hearing loss. We should certainly investigate that further. Now, outside of the work environment, are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. My hands… they ache sometimes, especially at night. I thought it was just from working with the metal all day. They get… stiff. And it’s hard to grip things sometimes. It's getting harder to open jars, even. Small things, really. I don’t know if it’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s definitely relevant, Ms. Fontanazza. Pain, especially when it occurs at night, and difficulty with grip, can indicate a number of things. Now, has this been a gradual onset, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It started… slowly. Just a little ache after a long day. Then it started happening more often. Now it's almost every night. My husband gets annoyed because I sometimes wake him up when I move my hands. He says I should just ignore it. Men. They never understand.
DOCTOR: <stage>I sigh inwardly, making a more prominent note. "Gradual onset hand pain, nocturnal symptoms. Husband dismissive. Potential for… carpal tunnel?
