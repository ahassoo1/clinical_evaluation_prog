DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s… lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Bartok is the name. I... think I gotta get checked out for somethin'. Some kinda... sports thing. My nephew, he signed me up. Didn't really ask me if I wanted to, you know? Just... said I needed a look-see. It's for... tryouts. Yes, tryouts. Don't rightly remember what kinda tryouts though.
DOCTOR: Tryouts, yes. And… what sport were you hoping to try out for, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Sport? Hmm. That's... a good question. My nephew, he's always been... enthusiastic. Said somethin' about throwin' a ball. Or kickin' one. Maybe both? Honestly, Doctor, my memory ain't what it used to be. It's one of them things, I suppose. Gets harder as you get older. It wasn't football, was it? I don't think I'm runnin' around like that anymore. Too much... strain.
DOCTOR: <stage>I offer a reassuring smile, tapping my pen against the chart. It's alright, Mr. Bartok. We’ll figure it out. It's common for memory to be a bit… hazy. Let’s try this: are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really... no. A little ache in my shoulder sometimes, but that’s just... livin', you know? Old injury. Pulled somethin' back in '98, I think it was. Buildin' a fence. Not a sharp pain, just... there. It doesn't bother me much. Mostly just when it's cold. Is that what you're askin' about, Doctor? Shoulder pain? Or somethin' else?
DOCTOR: Yes, the shoulder pain is helpful to know. And no, I was asking about any pain currently, not just the shoulder. Any aches, discomfort, anything at all that's bothering you today?
PATIENT: Today? Hmm. Let me think... Well, my feet are a little sore. Standin' all day, you know? That's just... work. And maybe a little tired. Didn't sleep too good last night. The neighbor's dog was barkin' all night. Kept me up. But nothin' serious. Just... old man stuff, Doctor. Is that what you need to know? About the little things? I don't get sick much, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, those details are all helpful, Mr. Bartok. Thank you. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your breathing recently?
PATIENT: Breathing? Changes...? Doctor, I breathe every day. Don't really think about it, to be honest. Maybe a little short of breath when I climb the stairs, but that's just... stairs, you know? I ain't a young man anymore. Haven't noticed nothin' different though. Why do you ask? Is somethin' wrong? My nephew didn't say anything about my lungs... He just said I needed a checkup for this... tryout thing. Still don't know what kinda tryout it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we just want to be thorough, Mr. Bartok. It's standard procedure. Now, have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness...? Now that you mention it... I did feel a little off-balance this mornin'. When I was gettin' outta bed. But I just figured I didn't get enough sleep. It passed pretty quick. Didn't fall or nothin'. Just a little... wobbly. Is that what you mean by dizziness? I haven't been spinnin' around or nothin'. Just... a little unsteady. It didn’t last long, Doctor. Maybe a minute or two. Happens sometimes, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your vision, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Vision? Well, it ain't what it used to be. That’s why I got these glasses, see? Things are a little blurry without 'em. Especially far away. I get my eyes checked every couple of years. Last time was… uh… I think it was 2023. Everything was alright then. Doctor, are you askin’ if I can see well enough for this tryout? Because honestly, I haven't even thought about that yet. I’m still tryin’ to figure out what I'm tryin’ out for!
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll get to that, Mr. Bartok. I understand your frustration. Let’s just finish a quick run-through of some questions. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling...? Now that you say it… yeah, a little bit. Especially at the end of the day. After standin' all day at the job site. But I figured it was just from bein' on my feet so long. My shoes are a little tight, maybe? I don't usually pay much attention to it. It goes down when I put my feet up. Doctor, is this somethin’ serious? My nephew didn’t say anything about my feet bein’ swollen. He just… signed me up for this thing. Still don’t know what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let's try to clarify this "tryout." Do you recall anything about the conversation with your nephew?
PATIENT: Conversation...? Hmm. Vaguely. He was... excited. Said somethin’ about a team. And... glory. Yes, glory! He gets like that sometimes. Said it was a good opportunity. Maybe a chance to… show what I’m made of. He did mention somethin’ about a uniform. Blue, I think. And... a ball. Definitely a ball. But what kind of ball, I honestly couldn't tell you. He just kinda… talked at me. He’s a fast talker, that one. I think he said it was at the community center. Yes, that's right. Community center. But that's about all I remember, Doctor. He just sorta... swept me up in his enthusiasm. I mostly just nodded and smiled. I didn’t want to disappoint him. Still… still don't know what kinda tryout it is! .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. That might help us piece things together. Would that be alright?
