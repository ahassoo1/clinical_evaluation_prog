DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. Why don't we start with what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for…oh, goodness, I’d say almost a week now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a real doozy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. A headache at the back of your head for almost a week, coming and going, and pretty intense when it’s present. Can you tell me a little more about what it feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it’s not like a throbbing pain, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. It’s more… a pressure, I guess. A tight band around my head, kinda feelin' like someone's squeezin'. And sometimes it goes all the way down my neck a little, makes it stiff. It’s hard to describe, really. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Percell. A pressure, like a tight band, and some stiffness in your neck. Okay. And when this headache comes on, are there any things that seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… Now, I’ve been doin’ a lot of gardenin’ lately, tryin’ to grow some herbs for my niece. Could be that. Bendin' and lookin' down a lot. And…oh, and I was helpin' my grandson move some boxes last weekend. Heavy stuff. I don't know if either of those is it, though. It doesn’t always happen after doin’ somethin' physical. Sometimes it just…is there. I wish I knew for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening and helping your grandson move – so some physical activity seems to possibly be a factor, but it's not always consistent. And it just comes on sometimes without any clear reason. Besides the headache and neck stiffness, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea. Just the headache and the neck stiffness. Oh… wait a minute. I have been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I figured that’s just ‘cause I’m an old man! I’ve been sleepin’ okay, though, I think. Not much different than usual. I do feel a little warm sometimes, but the weather’s been hot, so… I don’t know if that means anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more tired than usual, and feeling warm, but you attribute that to the weather. No dizziness, blurry vision, or nausea. Let's talk about your medical history for a bit, Percell, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. Stopped takin' 'em a long time ago, though, once my wife… well, after my wife passed, I kinda fell off the wagon with things like that. Haven't seen a doctor regularly since. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ major like that. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old!
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure that was previously controlled with medication, but you haven't been taking anything regularly since your wife passed. And no other major medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Now, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, stationed over in…well, never you mind where. A long time ago. And…oh, and I had a knee replacement a few years back. The right one. It’s doin’ alright, though. Doesn’t bother me much. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. Small things, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal in your youth and a right knee replacement. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I can eat just about anythin' they put in front of me. And I spend plenty of time in the garden, so I'm sure I’m allergic to something out there, but nothin’ serious enough to bother me. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. No known allergies. And you’re not currently taking any medications. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, my mother had arthritis, real bad. She was crippled up towards the end. And my father… he had some kind of heart trouble, I think. Didn’t live to be very old. But that’s about all I know, really. My siblings… they were mostly healthy, as far as I know. We didn’t keep in close touch, so I didn’t always hear about what was goin’ on with them. It's hard to recall everything after all this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your father. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Like I said, I do a lot of gardenin’. Keeps me busy, keeps me movin’. I try to walk a little every day, too, when the weather’s good. I live alone, mostly. I see my grandkids from time to time, and I have a few friends I have coffee with now and then. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little beer with dinner, but I cut back on that a while ago. Doc said it wasn't doin' me any good. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. Nothing fancy, but I take care of myself as best I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. Gardening, walking, spending time with family and friends, no smoking, limited alcohol, and a generally healthy diet. That's good to hear. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neck and shoulders. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm not afraid of a little pokin' and proddin'. Just want to get to the bottom of this headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds good, nice and regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your neck and shoulders. I’m feeling some tightness and tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull and in your neck. Not anything alarmingly tight, but definitely some tension there. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Right there, on both sides. Not a sharp pain, just… achy. Like a dull throb, kinda like the headache itself. It feels a bit better when you don't press, though. It's been like that for a few days now. I’ve been tryin’ to rub it out myself, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tenderness and achiness in the neck muscles, especially at the base of the skull, and that’s consistent with the headache you're describing. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination findings, it seems like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. The gardening and helping your grandson move could have contributed to that. However, because your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you haven’t seen a doctor regularly in a while, I'd like to order some basic blood tests just to rule out anything else that could be contributing to your headache. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. I don’t mind gettin’ some tests done if it’ll put my mind at ease. High blood pressure runs in the family, so it wouldn’t surprise me if it was that. Blood tests, you say? What kind of tests are we talkin’ about? Just curious. And will I need to fast before I go? I had a big breakfast this morning.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'd like to check a complete blood count to look at your overall health, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level just to make sure your thyroid is functioning properly. And we'll check your cholesterol levels, since high blood pressure and cholesterol often go hand-in-hand. You will need to fast for at least eight to twelve hours before the blood draw, so no food or drinks other than water. Since you’ve had breakfast, we’ll have to reschedule the blood work for tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning would be fine, Doctor. I can skip breakfast. Eight to twelve hours, you say? That's not too bad. I usually eat pretty early anyway. Just let me know what time I should be here and where I need to go. And will I get the results right away, or will I have to wait a few days? I'm not one for worryin', but I do like to know these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll schedule you for a blood draw tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. Just head to the lab here in the clinic, and they'll take care of you. The results usually take about two to three business days to come back. Once they’re available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I’d recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the headache, as long as you don't have any allergies or other medical conditions that would prevent you from taking them. Also, try to avoid straining your neck muscles, and consider using a warm compress or taking a warm shower to help relax them. Are you currently experiencing any fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness?
PATIENT: No fever, no vision changes, no weakness, and no numbness. Just the headache and the tight neck. I think I can manage with some over-the-counter pain relievers and a warm shower. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a lot better just talkin' about it, to be honest. You've been very helpful. Eight o'clock tomorrow morning, you said? I'll be here. Is there anything else I need to know before I go?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. No, that’s all for now. Just remember to fast for eight to twelve hours before the blood draw tomorrow. We’ll get those results back as quickly as possible and make a plan to get you feeling better. If anything changes – if your headache gets worse, you develop any new symptoms, or you start to feel unwell – please don't hesitate to call the clinic right away. Here’s a handout with information about tension headaches and some tips for managing them. Have a good day, Percell, and I’ll see you tomorrow morning. And thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. I appreciate your time and your kindness. I’ll be here tomorrow at eight o'clock.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. Goodbye. .
