DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I... just moved here. I think that's why I'm here? Like, to get set up with a doctor and stuff. I have Medicare. I don't really... remember why else. My husband helped me book it, and he said it was important.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. Getting established with a primary care physician when you move is very important, and it's common to have a bit of difficulty recalling details, especially with a recent move. We'll take things at your own pace. Just to confirm, your husband assisted with scheduling this appointment for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, he did. He's really good at that sort of thing. I... forget his name sometimes, which is bad, I know. We've been married a long time though. He just said I needed a check-up and to make sure everything was okay now that we're living... well, I think it's rural, right? He said the air was different here. Is that true?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to have occasional memory lapses, Emileigh. Don't worry about it at all. And yes, you are correct, we are located in a rural area. It is true that the air quality and environmental factors can differ depending on location, and it's good your husband is thinking ahead about that. To start with your check-up, I’d like to gather some information about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Um... that's hard. I... don't really remember. I had chickenpox when I was little, I think? And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. I don't... go to the doctor much. My husband usually handles all of that. He'll probably know better than me. I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Emileigh. We can certainly work with what you remember, and if your husband is able to provide additional details, that would be very helpful. We’ll do our best to piece things together. Just so I have a complete picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: I… think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid? But it was so long ago, I barely remember it. Everything was blurry then. And… no, I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital since. Not that I remember, anyway. I get really tired sometimes, but I just sleep it off. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy. Good to know. And yes, fatigue can be important, Emileigh. It's good you mentioned it. Could you describe what you mean by "really tired"?
PATIENT: Um... just... sleepy. All the time. Even after I sleep a lot. Like, I can sleep eight or nine hours and still feel like I need a nap. And it's not just when I'm bored. It's... hard to explain. It makes it hard to do things. I try to help my husband with stuff, but sometimes I just… have to sit down. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Emileigh. Fatigue that persists even after adequate sleep is something we should investigate further. And it’s good you’re recognizing it’s impacting your ability to do things. To help me understand better, has this fatigue been a recent change, or has it been going on for a long time?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s gotten worse since we moved. But I always get tired, a little. Like, even before. But now… it’s harder to get up in the morning. And I feel… wobbly sometimes. Like I might fall. It’s scary. My husband says I just need to rest more. But I am resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems this fatigue has been a long-standing issue, but has worsened since your move, and is now accompanied by feeling “wobbly.” That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other illnesses that your parents or siblings have had?
PATIENT: Oh boy… that’s hard too. My mom… she had something with her heart, I think? But she passed away a long time ago, so I don’t remember much. My dad… he was pretty healthy, I think. He liked to garden. And… I don’t have any siblings, so… I’m not sure. I’m really bad at remembering stuff like that. It makes me feel awful. I want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Emileigh. Don’t feel bad at all. It's perfectly alright if you don’t remember specific details. We'll work with what you can recall. Knowing your mother had a heart condition is good information, and that’s a starting point. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I haven’t really had any bad reactions to anything that I remember. My husband always checks when he gives me medicine. He’s really careful. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… maybe pollen? I sneeze a lot in the spring. But everyone sneezes in the spring, right? I don’t know. Sorry, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Emileigh. Seasonal allergies are common, and it’s good you mentioned the sneezing. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes I take something for my headaches. They come and go. My husband buys them for me, and I think they’re… ibuprofen? Or something like that. Just when they get really bad. And… sometimes I take a vitamin, but I forget to. It’s just a multivitamin, I think. That's all. Really. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for headaches and occasionally a multivitamin. Thank you. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Definitely not. Never. My husband doesn’t smoke or drink either. We both like to garden and… watch TV. We’re pretty boring, really. I don't even like the smell of smoke. It makes me cough. So, no, nothing like that. Ever.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. A quiet life can be very fulfilling, Emileigh. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Um… okay. If you think it’s important. I don’t really like going to the doctor, but… I want to feel better. And my husband said it was a good idea. So… yeah, okay. Just… be gentle, please? I get scared easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll take things at your pace. It will only take a few minutes. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds a little fast, but regular. Your lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal. Do you feel any dizziness or lightheadedness when I ask you to stand up?
PATIENT: Um… a little bit. It feels… wobbly, like I said before. Not terrible, but… definitely not steady. I have to hold onto something. It’s worse when I stand up quickly. Is that bad? Should I sit down? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: It’s good you told me. It’s not bad that you told me, Emileigh. And yes, feeling dizzy or lightheaded when standing up – what we call orthostatic hypotension – can be concerning. It suggests your blood pressure drops significantly when you stand. We need to investigate that further. Given your symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order some blood tests and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Um… okay. If you think it’s necessary. Blood tests… that sounds scary. But… if it will help me feel better, then yes. And… what’s an EKG? Is that… painful? I don’t like needles, and I don't like being poked and prodded. I'm already feeling nervous just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be nervous, Emileigh. Blood tests are a routine procedure, and while they do involve a small needle prick, it’s usually very quick and causes minimal discomfort. Most people find it barely noticeable. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. Small stickers, called electrodes, are placed on your chest, arms, and legs. They don’t send any electricity into your body; they just detect the electrical signals. It doesn't hurt at all. I'll write the orders for these tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will explain the procedure to you. If you're feeling anxious, you can bring someone with you. We can also arrange for you to come back another day if you prefer. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Um… yes, please. A follow-up appointment. That would be good. I… I don't want to go through this alone. And… maybe my husband can come with me next time? He’s really good at asking questions. I always forget what I want to say. And… thank you. For being gentle. And explaining things. I was really scared at first.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. That’s perfectly alright, and I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety. Absolutely, please bring your husband with you to the follow-up appointment. Having someone there for support and to help with questions is always a good idea. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you on August 16th at 10:00 AM. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to prepare for the blood tests, and they'll let you know where to go for the EKG. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that's all. You explained everything really well. I… I just want to feel better. And I’m glad I came. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. I guess… I’ll go get the blood tests done now? Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad you came in, too. Please take your time getting to the lab, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. I look forward to seeing you on August 16th. And please remember, if anything changes or you're feeling worse, don’t wait – go to the emergency room. Have a good day, Emileigh. .
