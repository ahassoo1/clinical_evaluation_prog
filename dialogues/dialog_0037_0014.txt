DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. AX. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. AX, is it? Yes, good to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… Oh! Right. Paperwork. My wife… she said something about needing forms filled out. For… time off, I think? Or maybe… something with the insurance? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I'm the Director of Religious Activities and Education, and things get… busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, forms for time off or insurance paperwork. That's perfectly alright – it happens. It sounds like this is more of an administrative visit then. To be sure, and to cover all bases, is there anything you are experiencing health-wise that prompted this visit, or is it solely related to the paperwork?
PATIENT: Health-wise… Well, I’ve been… feeling a little tired lately. But at my age, isn’t everyone? It’s hard to say if it’s anything to do with the forms, or just… getting older. Honestly, I mostly just want to get the paperwork sorted so my wife doesn’t have to worry about it. She handles everything. I’m not sure what kind of paperwork it is, exactly. Is it FMLA? I think she mentioned that name…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. I see here you are 67 years old. Fatigue can certainly have a lot of causes, and it’s good you’re mentioning it. We'll definitely address that. And yes, FMLA is a possibility, it covers family and medical leave. Just to get a better picture, could you describe the fatigue a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it… Hmm. It’s just… I used to be able to do all sorts of things, you know? Work all day, spend time with the family, even a little gardening. Now, I find myself needing to sit down more often. A little nap in the afternoon. Nothing serious, Doctor, truly. Just… not as much energy. It’s been going on for… well, a few months, I suppose. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, everything just sort of… faded in, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual decrease in energy over several months. And it’s impacting your ability to do some of the things you enjoy. That’s helpful information. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me see. My wife says I’ve been a little more… forgetful. But she always says that! I think I’m just getting old, honestly. I forget where I put my keys sometimes, or the name of a flower in the garden. Small things, really. Nothing major. And… now that I think about it, maybe I haven’t been sleeping as well as I used to. Waking up a few times during the night. But… could that be the fatigue? Everything feels connected, you know? It’s hard to tell what’s causing what.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased forgetfulness and some disrupted sleep. Those things can certainly be related, and fatigue can contribute to both. Just to get a complete picture, have you experienced any weight loss, changes in appetite, fever, chills, or any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Hmm. I don’t think so. My wife keeps a pretty close eye on my eating, makes sure I’m getting enough. Maybe a pound or two, but nothing significant. Appetite's been normal, I suppose. No fever or chills, thankfully. And… no pain, no. Everything just feels… tired. A general feeling of being worn out, you know? Nothing specific. I'm a pretty big guy, Doctor—188 centimeters and around 111 kilograms—so a little weight fluctuation isn’t noticeable unless my wife points it out. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like we're dealing with a constellation of symptoms—fatigue, some memory concerns, and disrupted sleep. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I had my prostate checked a few years back. Everything was alright then, they said. And… oh! I had a bit of a knee problem when I was younger, playing rugby. But that's been sorted out now, years ago. Otherwise… I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. Nothing major, I don't think. I see a doctor for my yearly check-ups, but nothing serious ever comes up. My wife handles all the details, honestly. I remember going to the doctor, but not usually what they said. I'm not very good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: Okay, prostate check a few years ago was normal, and a knee injury in the past. No other major medical conditions that you're aware of. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very long time ago. And… that's about it, I believe. Nothing else that I can recall. I wasn’t very sick growing up, thankfully. My wife might remember more details, but… she’s not here today. I try to remember, but it’s all a bit fuzzy. It’s like looking at a very old photograph, you know? The details aren’t very clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in childhood. No other surgeries that you recall. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, dementia, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father… he had a weak heart. He passed away when I was young. My mother… she lived a long life, but she did have some trouble with her memory towards the end. Not sure what it was exactly, just… forgetful, you know? My siblings… they're all pretty healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major that I can recall. We didn’t really talk about medical things much. My wife knows more about all that, I’m sure. She keeps track of everything. I’m not very good at remembering family medical details, sorry. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease in your father and some memory issues in your mother. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I'm retired now, so I don't have a strenuous job. As Director of Religious Activities and Education, it’s mostly meetings and… well, religious activities. I try to stay active, but it’s hard sometimes with the fatigue. I used to enjoy gardening, but I don't do as much of that anymore. I eat a pretty healthy diet, my wife makes sure of that. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little wine with dinner occasionally. Overall, I try to live a good, healthy life, you know? It’s just getting a little harder as I get older.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, Director of Religious Activities and Education, healthy diet, no smoking, occasional wine. Finally, let's talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of, no. Never had a reaction to anything. And… medications. I take a small pill for my blood pressure, but that’s it. Nothing else. My doctor prescribed it a few years back. It's just a small dose, really. I don't take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements. My wife keeps track of all that, makes sure I'm taking the right things at the right time. I just take what she gives me. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco, that gives me a good overall picture. You’re 67, generally healthy, but experiencing fatigue, some memory concerns, and disrupted sleep. Family history includes heart disease and some memory issues. You take a small pill for blood pressure. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. A quick exam sounds good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Hopefully, we can figure out what's causing all this tiredness. It's just… getting harder to do things, you know? Whatever you think is best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur. It’s not concerning, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your throat and ears. Everything looks normal here. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Your reflexes are normal and your strength is good in all your extremities. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious cause for your fatigue, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should address.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, you say? Oh dear. My father had trouble with that too, I think. The murmur… is that serious? So, what does all this mean, Doctor? What’s causing the tiredness? And what about the forgetfulness? Is that just… getting old? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it's understandable to be concerned. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we need to manage. We'll discuss options for that in a moment. The heart murmur is a common finding, especially as we age, and it’s not causing any immediate concern in your case. As for the fatigue and forgetfulness, there could be several possible causes. It could be related to the elevated blood pressure, or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests. These tests will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying infections or other medical conditions. We will also perform an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I would also recommend a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It's a simple test that can help us determine if there's any cause for concern. I want to be thorough, Mr. Limtiaco, and rule out any serious underlying causes before we attribute everything to aging. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. Blood tests… and an EKG. And the thinking test… you think that’s a good idea? I have been forgetting things more lately, it’s just… embarrassing. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what’s going on. And… is there anything I can do right now to feel a little better? The tiredness is really dragging me down. Anything at all? Perhaps… a little less stress? My wife says I worry too much. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. We’re going to investigate this thoroughly. And you're right, managing stress is a good first step. It can definitely exacerbate fatigue and cognitive issues. In the meantime, I recommend prioritizing sleep—aim for 7-8 hours per night. Regular, gentle exercise—like walking—can also help boost energy levels. And make sure you're staying hydrated and eating a healthy diet. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood tests and EKG, and I'll have my nurse schedule you for the cognitive assessment. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and develop a plan to address your symptoms. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low-dose medication to help manage your blood pressure. It's important to take it as directed. We’ll monitor your blood pressure regularly to ensure it’s under control. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Sleep… exercise… healthy diet… yes, I can manage that. I'll try, anyway. My wife will be happy to hear that. A prescription for the blood pressure… okay. Um… what kind of side effects does the medicine have? And… how long will it take to get the results from the tests? I’m a little anxious about waiting. And… will the cognitive assessment be difficult? I don't want to feel embarrassed if I can't remember things. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Limtiaco. It is a lot. The blood pressure medication—Lisinopril—can sometimes cause a dry cough, dizziness, or fatigue, but these side effects are usually mild and temporary. If you experience any of these, please let me know, and we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. The blood tests and EKG results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. As for the cognitive assessment, it’s a simple test that involves answering some questions and performing a few memory tasks. It’s not a pass or fail test, and it’s not meant to be stressful. It’s simply a way for us to get a baseline understanding of your cognitive function. The technician administering the test is very experienced and will make you feel comfortable. It’s a non-judgmental environment. I'm going to print out a summary of our discussion, along with the medication information and referrals. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. You explained everything so clearly, and you didn't make me feel rushed or embarrassed. I appreciate that. I'll try to get more sleep, eat healthy, and exercise. And I'll let my wife know about the tests and the medicine. She'll be happy to hear we're getting things sorted out. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re a team, and we’ll work through this together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here is your paperwork. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
