DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Chora. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is… hurting. A lot. It's a sore, you see. Been there a little while now, and it’s not getting better. I think it’s a ulcer, the nice lady at the pharmacy said so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that's been bothering you for a while. And the pharmacist mentioned a possible ulcer. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It's on the bottom of my foot, right near my heel. It's… red, and kinda deep. Not bleeding much right now, but it feels… warm. And it hurts when I walk, even with slippers on. I try to stay off it, but you know… gotta get to the kitchen. I also have the sugar sickness, the doctor told me years ago. Does that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's on the bottom of your foot near your heel, red and deep, feels warm, and painful with walking. And you mentioned you have diabetes – the “sugar sickness” as you put it. Yes, that can absolutely be related. Diabetes can sometimes cause problems with blood flow and healing in the feet, and that can lead to ulcers. Let's get a better look. I'm going to need to do a quick exam of your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to feel better. It’s been a worry, you see. I don’t like being stuck inside all the time. Is it going to hurt when you look at it?
DOCTOR: It might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to examine the area, feel around, and check the circulation in your foot. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, let's take a look. Could you please point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Yes, right here. When I press right here, it’s the worst. And a little bit all around it, but mostly right on this spot. It feels… tender. Like a bruise, but not really. Does that make sense? I am not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And you're right, it is tender to the touch. There's a definite area of redness and some slight swelling. I’m also noting a small amount of drainage… it doesn’t look infected right now, but we need to keep an eye on it. Your pulses feel a little weak in your left foot compared to your right, which is something we’ll want to investigate further. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Not all the time, but… especially in the evenings, my toes feel kinda… sleepy. Like they’re not really there. It’s not a bad feeling, just… not as awake, you know? And sometimes it feels cold, even when the room isn't cold. Is that what you mean by numbness? I forget things easily, so I don’t always remember when it happens.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like numbness and tingling, which is often described as “sleepy” or feeling cold. That can be another sign related to diabetes, affecting the nerves in your feet. Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer, I'm concerned about this ulcer, especially with your diabetes and the decreased pulses in your foot. I’m going to order some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll need to check your blood sugar levels, do a wound culture to see if there’s an infection, and I want to get an Ankle-Brachial Index to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want it fixed, you know? The tests… will they hurt? And how long will it take? I have church on Sunday, and I don’t want to miss that. It's important to me. I don't like being a bother.
DOCTOR: No, the tests shouldn’t be too painful at all. The blood sugar check is just a small prick of the finger, like when you get your blood pressure checked. And the ABI is non-invasive – I’ll just use a special cuff to measure the blood pressure in your ankles and arms. It won’t take long, maybe 20-30 minutes for everything. We can schedule the lab work for tomorrow, and I’ll have the results back by Friday. We’ll talk about them then, and make a plan to get this ulcer healed. As for missing church, let’s hope we can avoid that. We’ll do our best to get you feeling better before Sunday. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I haven’t taken much medicine over the years. Just some for my arthritis, but that was a long time ago. I think it was… ibuprofen? Or something like that. I don’t remember the name exactly. And I'm not allergic to anything else, as far as I know. My wife always took care of all that. It's been… hard since she’s gone. But she would want me to get this looked after.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. Losing your wife must be very difficult. It’s good you’re taking care of yourself, and I’m glad you’re here. Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned ibuprofen in the past. I will make a note of that. Alright, I’m going to write you a prescription for a special dressing for the ulcer. It will help keep it clean and promote healing. I’ll also give you instructions on how to care for it at home. It's very important to keep the pressure off your foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker you use?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't use a cane or a walker. I get around okay… slowly. But I have been trying to stay off my foot as much as I can. My daughter, she bought me some thick socks, those help a little. She worries about me. She is a good girl. Do I need to do anything special with the dressing? Like, how often do I change it? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: That's good that you’re trying to stay off it. And it's wonderful your daughter is looking out for you. The dressing will need to be changed daily, or more often if it gets wet or soiled. I’m writing detailed instructions, including pictures, on how to do it properly. It’s important to keep the wound clean and covered. You’ll also want to monitor it for any signs of infection – increased redness, swelling, pain, pus, or fever. If you notice any of those signs, call my office immediately. I’m also going to give you a referral to a podiatrist. They specialize in foot care and can help us manage this ulcer long-term. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A podiatrist… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If it helps. I trust your judgement. You’ve been very kind. My daughter, she always tells me to get a second opinion, but I like you. I feel safe here. Will the podiatrist be at the same building? And about the socks… are they okay to keep wearing? They’re nice and thick, like you said. Do I need special shoes? I mostly wear slippers.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Stoegbauer. I appreciate your trust. The podiatrist is in a different building, but it's not far – I'll give you the address and phone number. And yes, keep wearing the thick socks – they're great for cushioning and protecting your foot. However, slippers aren’t ideal for healing, as they don't provide much support. I recommend getting a pair of supportive shoes, preferably with a wide toe box. The podiatrist can advise you on the best type of shoes for your condition. Okay, here are the prescriptions, care instructions, and the referral to the podiatrist. Please call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, Mr. Stoegbauer, and please follow up with the podiatrist as soon as possible. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
