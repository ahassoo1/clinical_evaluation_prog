DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s rather simple, Doctor. I want a baby. And I want it to be… uncomplicated. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’d like to avoid any… problems if that’s possible. I’ve heard good things about your… efficiency.
DOCTOR: Alright, a preconception consultation. Excellent. That’s a very sensible approach. To help me understand your situation better, and to try and make things as smooth as possible, let’s go through some things. It’s been a while since I’ve seen you… perhaps we can start with a bit of your medical history?
PATIENT: Must we? Really? I suppose. But I assure you, it’s all quite… normal. I’ve never had anything serious. Divorced, as you probably see on the form. Medicare. Bicycle repair is strenuous work, keeps me fit. What exactly do you need to know? Just the basics, if you please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, just the basics. It helps me build a complete picture. Let's start with any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma… anything at all. And then, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s all very… unremarkable. No high blood pressure. Never had diabetes. A touch of hay fever in the spring, but that’s hardly a medical condition. Surgeries? Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. Ages ago. And a minor procedure on my knee, years back, from a bicycle accident. Nothing important. Are we finished yet? This is rather tedious, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And just to be thorough, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Honestly, Doctor, a mixed bag. My mother had… something with her nerves, I think. Always complaining. My father was generally healthy, a smoker though, if that matters. My grandmother had… arthritis, I believe. It's all rather distant, really. I wasn’t particularly close to anyone. Are you writing all this down? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. It helps me to build a complete picture, and sometimes even seemingly minor details can be useful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. I eat properly, I exercise. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that's it. Nothing regularly. I certainly don’t need pills for everything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy woman. This is getting rather insulting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. I certainly wasn't implying anything of the sort. It's just a routine part of the assessment. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything in my life. I’m perfectly robust, Doctor. Can we please move on? I have things to do. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Thank you for that information. Now, let's talk a little about your current cycle. Can you tell me about the regularity of your periods?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must we delve into this? Really? It’s… regular. Enough said. I haven't missed a period in… well, a very long time. It’s perfectly predictable. What difference does it make, honestly? I’m perfectly capable of having a baby, I assure you. I just want to ensure it's… uncomplicated. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all. Understanding your cycle helps us to optimize the timing, and to monitor everything closely. Now, just to clarify, when was the first day of your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep a calendar of these things. It was… sometime in June, I believe. Around the middle of the month, perhaps? I don’t recall the exact date. It's hardly relevant. I’m a healthy woman. I’ve always been regular. Are we finished yet? I have a bicycle to repair.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your frustration. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general sense of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I am perfectly healthy. I do not need a physical exam. I came here for a consultation, not an… inspection. I think I’ve answered enough questions. If you can’t help me, Doctor, I’ll find someone who can. I haven't got time for this. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your concerns. However, a basic physical exam is a standard part of preconception counseling, and it’s important to ensure your overall health. Given your reluctance, I can certainly respect your wishes. However, I would strongly recommend a consultation with a specialist in reproductive health. They may require further testing to assess your suitability for pregnancy and address any potential concerns. I can provide you with a referral, if you'd like. Would you like me to do that?
