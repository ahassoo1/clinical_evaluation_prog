DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Tofani. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my family, mostly. My grandson, bless his heart, he’s been having these spells, you see. Weakness on one side, mostly. And my daughter, her mother had terrible headaches… migraines, they called them. Just awful. I’m getting on, you know, 83 years old, and I worry. I just wanted to… get checked, I suppose. Make sure everything is alright. It's a bit fuzzy what exactly brought me here today, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're concerned about your grandson’s weakness and your daughter's history of headaches. And you want a general check-up for yourself, just to be safe. Let’s start with your grandson. Could you tell me a little more about these “spells” he’s having?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, he's a busy young man, works with computers, I think. These spells… they come on suddenly. He says his arm gets heavy, and he has trouble speaking for a bit. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes, but it scares him. My daughter says it’s happened… oh, maybe three or four times now in the last few months? It's hard to keep track. She took him to a doctor, but they didn't find anything immediately wrong, you know? Just said it could be stress. But… a grandmother worries.
DOCTOR: Stress, yes. That accounts for a great deal. And how old is your grandson?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… He was born in… 1988, I believe? So, that makes him… 37 now, yes. 37 years old. A good age, but too young to be having these troubles, don't you think? He tries to brush it off, says he's just tired, but I can tell it bothers him. He's a good boy, always has been.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your daughter’s mother – the one with the migraines – when did she have those headaches, and were they ever properly investigated?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother-in-law, you mean? She had those headaches for… well, as long as I knew her, really. Maybe starting in her 40s? They were… debilitating. She'd have to lie down in a dark room for hours. The doctors… they gave her pills, mostly. And told her to avoid certain foods. I don't think they ever really figured out what was causing them, to be honest. It was a long time ago, you see. Things weren’t as… precise then.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, family history is… helpful, I suppose. But let's focus on you for a moment, Ms. Tofani. You said you wanted a check-up. Are you experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Me? Well… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, you know? Like the room is spinning. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. And… I’ve been forgetting things lately. Not important things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast… little things like that. It’s probably just old age, I suppose. But my daughter insisted I come see you. She worries too, that one.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and forgetfulness. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The dizziness… maybe a few months now? It comes and goes. Not every day. And the forgetting… well, it’s been getting worse lately, I think. Hard to say exactly when it started, you see. It’s not like a sudden thing. Just… gradual. I used to be so good with dates and names, but now… it’s all a bit of a muddle.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just a little pill for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white one. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? They never agree with me.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. My daughter always says I have a strong constitution. But… I can’t be certain, you see? It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a quick look at you, Ms. Tofani. Just a basic exam, to get a better idea of what's going on. If you could just step up on the table here.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it's best. Just let me… I hope I don't fall. My balance isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular, though a bit faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. I'm trying to breathe deeply. This reminds me of when I was a little girl, and the doctor used to listen to my heart with one of these… It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I’m just going to check your eyes, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Just do what you need to do. I always thought my eyes were a pretty shade of blue, you know. My husband used to say so. He’s been gone a long time, though. A very good man, he was.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. A little bit of cataracts starting, but nothing significant at this point. Now, I’m going to listen to your carotid arteries, just to check for any blockages. Do you feel any dizziness when I turn your head to the side?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. My head? No, not really. Maybe a little… just a little dizzy, like I sometimes feel. But nothing too bad. It’s funny, isn’t it, how things change as you get older?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, everything seems relatively normal for your age, Ms. Tofani. The slight elevation in blood pressure is something we can monitor, and the dizziness and forgetfulness… well, those could be due to a number of things. It’s likely just age-related changes. However, given your grandson’s symptoms and your family history, I think it would be prudent to order a few tests. Just to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Tests, you say? What kind of tests? I don’t like hospitals, you know. They always smell so… clean. And my grandson… you think his spells could be something serious?
DOCTOR: We’ll start with a basic blood panel to check your overall health, and a vitamin B12 level, as that can sometimes cause memory problems. We’ll also do a thyroid test. As for your grandson, it's difficult to say without proper investigation. His symptoms could be stress, as the other doctor suggested, but it’s always best to rule out more serious causes, such as a transient ischemic attack – a mini-stroke – or even a neurological condition. We need to get him in for an MRI of the brain. It's the most accurate way to determine what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI? That sounds… frightening. And a mini-stroke? Oh dear. Is that… serious? My grandson is such a busy young man, he can’t afford to be ill. And me… I don’t want to be a bother, you know? I just came in because my daughter worried. But tests and MRIs… Is this going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Tofani, I understand your concerns. But it’s important to be proactive about your health, and your grandson’s. An MRI is a non-invasive procedure; he simply lies still inside a machine. And yes, a transient ischemic attack is serious, but early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of a full stroke. As for the cost, I can’t give you exact figures, but your insurance should cover a significant portion of it. I will have my staff assist you with navigating the insurance claims. Frankly, worrying about the cost won't help either of you. Let's focus on getting the necessary tests done, and then we can address any financial concerns afterwards. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, dear. If you think it’s best. A stroke… that sounds terrible. But you’re right, worrying won’t help. And my insurance… yes, I suppose they’ll cover something. My daughter handles all that, mostly. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… please be gentle with my grandson. He gets so nervous at the doctor’s office. And… thank you, dear. Thank you for listening to an old woman’s worries.
DOCTOR: Alright. My staff will schedule the tests for both of you. They'll explain the procedures and answer any questions you may have. We'll review the results as soon as they come in, and then we’ll formulate a plan. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please follow the nurse to the scheduling desk.
PATIENT: .
