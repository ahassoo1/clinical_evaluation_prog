DOCTOR: Hello, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Pfennig. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, actually. And I’ve been told I have a funny heartbeat, something called… atrial fibrillation, I think? It’s been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, that gives me a good starting point. Swelling in one leg and a recent mention of atrial fibrillation. Let’s unpack that a bit. First, tell me about the leg swelling. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe about a week ago? I noticed my trousers felt a bit tighter than usual, and when I took my shoes off, my left foot and ankle looked… bigger than my right one. I didn’t think much of it at first, just thought I maybe had been standing a lot. But it hasn’t gone down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of progressively worsening swelling in your left leg and ankle. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Not… terribly. It feels heavy, mostly. A bit achy if I’ve been on my feet all day. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull discomfort, if that makes sense? It’s not keeping me up at night or anything, but it is noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavy and achy, not sharp, worse with standing. And just to confirm, this is only in your left leg?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Only my left leg. My right leg feels perfectly normal, thank you. I keep comparing them, just to be sure. It’s quite the difference, actually. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. That helps narrow things down. Now, let's talk about this atrial fibrillation you mentioned. Who told you about that, and do you know anything more about it?
PATIENT: A doctor at the hospital. I went in for a check-up a few months back – just a general one – and they did some tests. He said my heartbeat was irregular. He used a lot of words I didn’t understand, something about the rhythm being off. He said it was atrial… fib… rill…ation. And he said I should see my regular doctor about it, but… I haven’t gotten around to it until now. I don't really feel any different, to be honest. Just a bit tired sometimes, but I put that down to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diagnosed a few months ago with atrial fibrillation, but you haven’t been experiencing any specific symptoms that you’ve connected to it, other than perhaps some fatigue. You said you haven’t felt any palpitations or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No fluttering or… palpitations, as you say. And I can breathe just fine, thank you. It’s just… tiredness. A general feeling of being a bit run down, but nothing major. And I do work long hours, so I thought it was just that. It’s difficult to know what’s normal and what’s not, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly can be. Okay, Nixon, let's do a quick exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your legs and ankles. Then we can talk about what might be going on and what tests, if any, we need to do. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please proceed. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this swelling, and hopefully, this irregular heartbeat isn’t too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate is irregularly irregular, as you were told. I don’t hear any concerning sounds in your lungs. Now, looking at your legs… there’s definite swelling in your left ankle and lower leg, compared to your right. I’m also noticing some discoloration, a bit of redness, and your left leg feels slightly warmer than your right. And, yes, I am able to indent the skin with my finger for a few seconds – that’s what we call pitting edema. Now, this combination of symptoms – the atrial fibrillation, the swelling, redness, warmth, and pitting edema – raises a few possibilities. One concern is deep vein thrombosis, or DVT – a blood clot in a deep vein. We need to rule that out. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, I don’t think so. No one has ever told me I have had blood clots. I’ve never been in hospital for anything serious, just… the check-up I mentioned earlier. And a broken arm when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. I haven't had any surgeries or anything like that. A blood clot… that sounds rather alarming, Doctor. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It can be, Nixon, which is why we need to investigate. A DVT can cause pain and swelling, but more seriously, a piece of that clot can travel to your lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, which is very serious. To rule it out, we’re going to need to do an ultrasound of your left leg. It’s a painless test, just involves a gel and a probe on your skin. We'll also need to do some blood work to check your overall health and rule out other causes of swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and blood work. Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what’s necessary to find out what’s going on, then please proceed. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Just… please let me know if anything is… concerning. I do get a bit anxious about these things, you see. It’s just… the thought of a blood clot travelling to my lungs… that’s quite frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Nixon. We'll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything as we go. I’ll order the ultrasound and blood work right away. The lab is just down the hall, and I’ll have a nurse draw the blood for you. We can usually get the ultrasound done within a few hours. Once we have the results, we'll sit down and discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your left leg as much as possible to help reduce the swelling. And try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable. Elevate my leg, avoid standing… I can do that. I sit a lot at my computer, so maybe I can just take more breaks and put my feet up. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something to find out what’s going on. Would you like me to go and see the nurse now?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Yes, please. I’ll have the nurse come and get you for the blood work. She’ll explain the process to you. I'll be here when you get back, and we’ll talk again once we have the results. Don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you have.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. I shall see the nurse.
