DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don’t have all day. I want to talk about… well, I look in the mirror, and things ain’t where they used to be. Everything’s… sagging. I want it fixed. Is that what you do here? Fix things?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're concerned about some changes you've noticed in your physical appearance. We certainly can discuss that. As a family medicine physician, I address a wide range of health concerns, and that includes evaluating changes in the body. When you say "sagging," could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Specific how? Look, I’m a man! It’s… everywhere. My belly, my arms… even there. It wasn't like this, you know? I used to be strong. Pile driving takes muscle! Now… it's just… loose. And it bothers me. Is that good enough specificity for you? I don’t do details, I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. It sounds like you’re experiencing a loss of muscle tone and some changes in your body composition. You mentioned you used to do pile driving – that’s a very physically demanding job. When did you stop doing that work?
PATIENT: Stopped? Let me think… About five years ago now. Bad back. Doctor told me to hang it up. Said I’d ruin myself completely if I kept at it. Which… I guess he was right. Everything just… went downhill after that. I try to walk a bit, but it's not the same. Not even close. It's just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, about five years ago you stopped pile driving due to a back injury, and you’ve noticed changes in your body since then. That’s important information. Besides the changes you've mentioned, have you noticed any other changes in your overall health – perhaps any weight loss or gain, changes in your energy levels, or any difficulties with things like walking or balance?
PATIENT: Weight? A little, maybe. I used to be a solid 180. Now… I don’t know, probably closer to 160, 150. Hard to say. Energy… well, I sleep a lot. More than I used to. And like I said, walking ain’t easy. Everything aches. Balance is… alright, I guess. Haven't fallen yet, but I feel… unsteady sometimes. It's like my bones are old. And everything’s just… soft. You understand? Soft! Not like it used to be. My wife… she used to say… never mind. She's gone now.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Trendler. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. To summarize, you've experienced some weight loss, increased fatigue, and some aches and pains, particularly with walking, along with a general feeling of weakness and softness. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam and then perhaps order some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Exam? Look, I’m not a fan of doctors. Never have been. But… if you think it’ll help, fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it, alright? I got things to do. Don't need to poke and prod for an hour. And no funny business, I don’t like being touched. Just tell me what’s wrong and what you can do to fix it. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Trendler. I completely understand your reluctance, and I assure you I'll be as efficient and respectful as possible. We’ll take it slowly and I'll explain everything as we go. I'll only touch you to perform the necessary exam, and I will always tell you what I'm doing before I do it. First, I'll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick exam of your muscles and joints. It shouldn't take long. If you could please have a seat here, we can get started.
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m telling you now, don’t expect me to be happy about this. And if you ask me to take my clothes off, I’m walking right out. Understand? Just… get on with it. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. You won't need to remove any clothing for this exam. I’ll just need to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and I’ll gently check your muscles and joints. First, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. It’ll just be a quick squeeze.
PATIENT: Squeeze all you want. Just don't poke me with anything. And don't tell me to breathe deeply or anything like that. I know how to breathe. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take normal breaths, just like you are. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength and reflexes. Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s not much, but it's all I got these days. Everything's going… weak. Like an old man. Don’t tell me I’m healthy. I know what’s happening to me. Just tell me what you can do about it. Don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: Your grip is good, but slightly weaker on your left side. That’s something we’ll keep in mind. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. This may feel a little strange. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. Based on what I’ve observed, it appears you have some muscle weakness and diminished reflexes, which could be related to several factors, including age, inactivity, and possibly some nerve involvement. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and inflammation, which can all contribute to muscle weakness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work. Of course. More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don’t have all day, you know. And make sure it doesn’t take a week to get the results. I don't want to keep coming back here. Just tell me what I need to do. Where do I go? Who do I talk to? I'm not good with all this… running around.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It won’t take long to get the results – usually about 3-5 business days. Here’s a requisition form for the blood work. You can go to any LabCorp location. There's one just down the street at 123 Main Street. You don't need an appointment. Just take this form with you, and they’ll take care of everything. And here are some instructions on how to prepare for the blood work – it’s mostly just fasting for 12 hours beforehand. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan to address your concerns. In the meantime, I recommend trying to stay as active as possible, even if it’s just gentle walking. And if you’re experiencing any significant pain or discomfort, please let me know. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: 12 hours? Walking? Look, I'm an old man. I do what I can. I doubt some blood work is gonna change anything. Just… call me when you get the results. Don't bother me until then. I'm done here. Hopefully, I won't have to come back. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day. .
