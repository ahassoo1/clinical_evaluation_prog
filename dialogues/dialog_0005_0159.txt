DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Fratoni, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. It’s… kinda weird, honestly. It’s just, getting up from chairs. It's been happenin' more and more lately. Like, I'll be sittin' fine, then… effort. A lot of effort. Feels like somethin’s stuck. It’s not pain, exactly, just… stuck.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," you say. Hmm. And how long has this "stuck" feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… three, four months now? Started kinda slow. I figured I just slept wrong or somethin'. We do a lot of heavy liftin’ at the oil rigs, ya know? Thought it was just muscles. But it’s… not gettin' better. If anything, it’s a little worse each week. I just… didn’t wanna bother anyone with it 'til it really started gettin' in the way. Ya know? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months. Gradual onset, worsening over time. And you mentioned heavy lifting at the oil rigs… is this happening during lifting, or more when you’re getting up from a chair after just sitting?
PATIENT: No, not during liftin'. It's when I'm just… sittin'. Like, after lunch, or end of shift, just relaxin’ in a chair. Then I go to stand up, and… whoosh. Gotta kinda push with my arms sometimes, or just… lean forward a whole bunch. It's mostly when I've been sittin' for a bit, I guess. Not so bad if I just get right up after a few minutes. But the longer I sit, the harder it is. It happened at the diner yesterday, almost tipped my chair over. That’s why I figured I should come in. My wife… well, she’d be worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's position-dependent – worse after prolonged sitting. And it’s causing some difficulty with balance, nearly tipping a chair. Do you notice it in any other situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, gettin' out of bed in the mornin’ is kinda similar. Not as bad, usually, but it takes me a sec to swing my legs over. And… oh! When I lean way forward to tie my shoes, I gotta brace myself a bit. It’s like… somethin's tight in my lower back. Not pain, like I said, just… resistance. I never really thought about it much, just figured I was gettin’ old. I'm 26, but… oil rig work ain’t easy on the body.
DOCTOR: “Getting old at 26,” right. It’s good you’re getting it checked out regardless. So, prolonged sitting, getting out of bed, and leaning forward to tie shoes… all with this feeling of resistance, primarily in the lower back. Any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingly bits. Legs feel fine. Strong as they ever were. I'm on my feet all day at work, so I'd definitely notice if somethin’ was wrong there. It’s just… the effort. It’s like there’s a block, you know? And I gotta kinda… work through it. It doesn't hurt, just… frustrating. My wife always said I was too stubborn to complain about stuff, maybe that's why I waited so long to come in. She'd be on me to see a doctor right away.
DOCTOR: Alright. No numbness, tingling, or weakness. Frustration and a feeling of resistance. Okay. Before we do a quick exam, let’s go through some basics. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I had the flu once, when I was a kid. And I broke my arm fallin’ outta a tree, but that healed up fine. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothin’ like that. I don’t take any pills or nothin’, either. Just… try to stay healthy, ya know? Eat when I can, sleep when I can. It’s hard on the rigs, sometimes. Mostly just… physical work. That's it. Honestly. My wife, Maria, she was always the healthy one. Always tellin' me to eat my vegetables. It’s… been a little hard since… since she passed.
DOCTOR: I see. And I’m very sorry for your loss. That must be incredibly difficult. Okay, no medical conditions, no medications. And you said this started to worsen around the time of your wife's passing?
PATIENT: Yeah… kinda. It was… subtle at first. Just a little bit harder to get up, you know? I just figured I was tired, stressed. Work was hectic. Everything was hectic. It was… gradual. It wasn’t like one day it just started. It just… slowly got harder. I probably shoulda come in sooner. Maria woulda made me. She always knew when somethin’ was wrong, even when I didn’t. She was… a good woman.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a lot has been going on. It’s perfectly understandable that getting this checked out might have slipped your mind. And it's good you're here now. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'm going to have you stand up and walk a few steps for me, then I'll check your range of motion and reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Walkin's no problem. I do a lot of that. Range of motion… hopefully that'll be okay too. I've always been pretty flexible. Just… warn me if somethin' feels bad, ya know? I don't wanna tip over on ya.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will. Just take your time, and let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort at any point. Alright, slowly stand up… perfect. Now, just walk a few steps forward, then back. I'm observing your gait and posture… Okay, good. Now, let’s check your back… could you bend forward and touch your toes for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Woah, hold on. That's… that's about as far as I can go right now. It's not pain, exactly, just… tight. Really tight. Feels like somethin’s blockin' me. And… oof. It's a little harder comin' back up. See? That's what I'm talkin' about. Not a sharp pain, just… resistance. Like I gotta force myself to move.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some muscle tightness in your lower back. There doesn’t appear to be any acute tenderness. Now, let me check your reflexes… Could you sit back down for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's… not the easiest thing to do right now. My reflexes are fine, though. Always been pretty quick. Used to play soccer when I was a kid. Didn't last long, but… yeah. Quick reflexes.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are indeed good, symmetric. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the limited physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing muscle strain, likely exacerbated by prolonged sitting and possibly related to stress and grief. It’s not uncommon to experience musculoskeletal issues during times of emotional distress. However, to rule out any other potential causes, like a disc issue, I’d like to order some basic imaging – an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… smart. X-ray sounds good. If it helps figure out what's goin' on, then yeah, definitely. I just… want to be able to get back to normal, ya know? Get back to work, get back to… just livin'. So, X-ray. When can I get that done?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to send you to the imaging center across the street. They’re open until 6 pm today, and you don't need an appointment. I'll have the results sent over to me, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if needed, and gentle stretching exercises. Avoid prolonged sitting when possible and try to stay active. I'm also going to give you a referral to a grief counselor. Losing your wife is incredibly difficult, and it's important to take care of your emotional well-being as well. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. A grief counselor… Maria woulda liked that. She always said I bottled things up. Ibuprofen and stretchin’… I can do that. And the X-ray. Okay. So, X-ray across the street. And I’ll get a call when they have the results? Then we’ll schedule another appointment. That sounds… like a plan. Thank you, Doc. Really.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. Yes, the imaging center will send the results directly to the clinic, and my assistant will contact you to schedule a follow-up. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as numbness, weakness, or severe pain. And remember, taking care of yourself – both physically and emotionally – is the most important thing right now. Here’s a printout with information on local grief counseling resources and some basic stretching exercises. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
