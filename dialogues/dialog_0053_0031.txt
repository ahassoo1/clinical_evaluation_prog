DOCTOR: Right. Nixon Kreckel, eighteen years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, my left leg is quite swollen, actually. It's been getting bigger for a few days now, and it's a bit uncomfortable. I… I have a heart thing, the doctor told me about it last year. Something about it not beating right. Atrial… something? I don’t remember the full name.
DOCTOR: An “atrial something,” right. Well, we’ll get to the bottom of that. Swollen leg, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It started small, just a bit bigger than my other leg, but now… well, you can see. It feels… tight, if that makes sense. And a little bit achy, mostly when I’ve been standing for a while. I haven’t bumped it or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this is only in the left leg?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Just the left one. My right leg feels perfectly normal. I haven't noticed any pain anywhere else, just in that leg. It's not… hot to the touch or anything, either. Just bigger. I’m a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. No redness, no warmth… well, that's… something. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, sir. I mean, I haven't been out of breath more than usual. I walk to school most days, and that's fine. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m a student, so that’s probably just that. Is that important? It's not connected to the leg, is it?
DOCTOR: Everything is connected, dear. We have to consider all possibilities. You said you were diagnosed with something… an atrial problem, last year?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. The doctor… Dr. MacIntyre, at the hospital… he said it was atrial fibrillation. That’s the name, I think. He put me on some pills to help, but they didn’t really seem to do much, so I stopped taking them a few months ago. I didn't feel any different, and they made my stomach upset sometimes. Was that… a bad idea? I didn't know if I should keep taking them if they weren't helping.
DOCTOR: Stopping medication without consulting a doctor… yes, that was… suboptimal. We'll need to discuss that. Let’s get some basic information first. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I'm allergic to penicillin. Makes me come out in a rash, and I get really itchy. And… I think I’m also a bit sensitive to codeine. Makes me feel really sick. Apart from that, I don’t think so. I haven’t had much need for medicine, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, penicillin and codeine. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not at the moment. I stopped taking those heart pills, like I said. I don't really take anything else, unless I get a bad headache, and then I might take paracetamol, but that's very rare. Just when it's really bad. I haven’t had a headache for weeks, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look at this leg, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Should I… should I take my shoes off? And my socks?
DOCTOR: Shoes off will do. We don’t need to get overly… thorough at this stage.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. It feels a bit silly taking shoes off for you, but… here it is. I hope it's not too bad. It does feel a bit bigger than usual, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some swelling, as you say. Not… dramatic, but present. And some mild pitting edema. Palpating the pulses… dorsalis pedis… okay. Posterior tibial… also present. Skin temperature is normal. No obvious signs of injury. Now, have you had any recent travel?
PATIENT: No, sir. I haven’t been anywhere recently. I spent the summer at home, helping my mum with the garden. Just local, really. No flying or anything. I haven’t even been to another town this year, if I’m honest. Is that important? Could it be something I caught from the garden? I was weeding a lot.
DOCTOR: Unlikely from the garden, dear. Though, one must consider all possibilities. Now, do you have any family history of… clots?
PATIENT: Clots, sir? You mean… like, blood clots? Oh… I don’t think so. My mum has high blood pressure, and my grandad had a stroke a few years ago, but I don’t know if that’s the same thing. He was very old, though. And my grandma has arthritis, but that’s just her joints, isn't it? I don’t think anyone’s had clots, specifically. Would that… cause my leg to swell? I'm a bit confused now.
DOCTOR: Right. High blood pressure and a stroke… that's… relevant. And yes, clots can cause swelling. We need to rule things out. Now, tell me about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't smoke. Never have. My mum wouldn’t allow it. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. I just… I study a lot, and I help out around the house. I try to walk when I can, but sometimes I get too busy. I do sit down quite a lot, I suppose, when I'm working on my computer. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Prolonged sitting… not ideal. Right. I think we need to get some blood tests done to assess your clotting factors and rule out any underlying issues. And we'll need to consider a D-dimer test. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Clotting factors? A… D-dimer test? No, sir, I don’t think so. What will that tell you? And… what will happen if it is something bad? Will I need to go to the hospital? Is it serious? I’m getting a bit worried now. I don't understand all these medical words. Could you explain it a bit simpler?
DOCTOR: Alright, dear. Let's simplify. A D-dimer test looks for signs of a blood clot. It's just a blood test, nothing to worry about. If it's elevated, it suggests there might be a clot. We’d then need further imaging, likely an ultrasound, to confirm. If there is a clot, it needs to be treated, which could involve medication and, in some cases, a hospital stay. But let's not jump to conclusions. We’re just gathering information at this stage. Now, I’m going to write a requisition for the blood tests. The nurse will take the sample. Then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: So… just a blood test for now? And then maybe an ultrasound if the blood test shows something? That doesn’t sound too bad. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I be able to walk normally afterwards? I have a computer science project due next week, and I really need to work on it. Will this stop me from doing that?
DOCTOR: The blood tests usually take a couple of days. As for walking, yes, you should be able to walk. But try to elevate your leg as much as possible in the meantime. And avoid prolonged sitting if you can. I’ll write a note explaining things to the nurse. She’ll take care of you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, sir. Should I… should I wait here for the nurse? Or do I go to the waiting room?
DOCTOR: The waiting room. The nurse will call your name. .
PATIENT: Oh… right. .
