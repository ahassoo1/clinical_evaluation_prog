DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Way, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's this pain I've been having. It's been bothering me for a little while now, you see. Mostly in my… well, it's hard to say exactly where, to be honest. It's kind of all over.
DOCTOR: "Kind of all over," you say. Right. That's… not particularly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: No, you're right. It's not, is it? Sorry. I'm not very good at explaining these things. It's mostly in my back, I think. And a little bit in my hip. But sometimes it feels like it goes down my leg, too. Not always, though. It's just… painful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Back, hip, sometimes radiating down the leg. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… maybe three or four months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little ache after I did some gardening. But it’s gotten worse over time, definitely. Now it’s almost always there, even when I’m just sitting.
DOCTOR: Three to four months. And you said gardening triggered it initially. What kind of gardening?
PATIENT: Oh, just the usual. You know, weeding, planting some tomatoes, that sort of thing. Nothing too strenuous, I thought. I’ve been doing that for years, no problem. It was mostly bending over, I guess. And kneeling, to get to the weeds. It’s that bending that really gets to me now.
DOCTOR: Bending. Alright. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you've ever felt, where would you rate this pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… Right now? I’d say… maybe a six? It's not crippling or anything, but it’s definitely noticeable. It's a constant ache, and if I try to move a certain way, it shoots up to an eight pretty quick. But usually around a six, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A six, with flares to an eight with movement. Okay. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, when I sit just right, it helps a little. And sometimes, if my wife rubs my back, that feels good. But it doesn't last long. Honestly, not much makes it really better, to be honest. Mostly, I just try to avoid doing things that make it worse. It's getting harder to do that, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, limited relief with positioning and massage. Do you have any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Not that I've noticed, anyway. My legs feel a little tired sometimes, especially after I've been on them a while. But weakness? No, I don't think so. I can still walk around okay. Everything feels pretty normal, strength-wise, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No neurological symptoms, that’s… something. Have you tried any medications for this, over-the-counter or anything prescribed by another doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My wife gave me some of her ibuprofen, you know, for arthritis. It helped a little, maybe took the edge off for an hour or so. But it didn't really do much long-term. I haven’t been to a doctor about this before, so I haven’t been prescribed anything. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen, minimal relief. And you prefer to avoid medication. Fair enough. Let’s have a look at your back, if you don’t mind. Could you stand up for me and bend forward, slowly, and touch your toes – or get as close as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. There. That's about as far as I can go without it really hurting. It feels tight, you know? Like something is blocking me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited range of motion, tenderness to palpation in the lumbar spine. I don't hear anything concerning auscultating. You have good posture, actually, but it seems quite stiff. Now, let’s try some straight leg raises. Lie down on your back, and I'm going to lift your leg up slowly, one at a time. Tell me if you feel any pain shooting down your leg.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, go ahead. Just let me know if it's going to be a sudden movement, though. I don't want to get surprised and pull something.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes! That's… that’s a little uncomfortable. Not sharp, exactly, more like a stretching feeling down the back of my leg. Just below the knee, mostly. It's not terrible, but I definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Stretching pain in the posterior thigh at 45 degrees. Now let’s try the other side.
PATIENT: Okay... That one... that one feels worse. A lot worse. Definitely pain shooting down the leg. And a little bit in my hip now, too. Oh, that's not comfortable, Doctor. It's kind of a burning sensation, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation, more pronounced on the left. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you have some fairly classic symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy – meaning a pinched nerve in your lower back, likely irritating the sciatic nerve. The left side seems more affected than the right. It’s not surprising given your history of gardening and the pain with bending. We need to get some imaging done to confirm this, rule out any other causes, and get a better look at what’s going on. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. Do you have any metal implants in your back?
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh dear. I've never had one of those before. Metal implants... no, I don't think so. I've never had any surgery on my back, or anywhere else, really. Just a few fillings in my teeth, if that counts. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? And how long does it take? I have a lunch date with my wife, you see.
DOCTOR: No, fillings are fine. An MRI is generally not painful, but you'll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. It’s a bit noisy, so we'll give you earplugs. Before we go any further, let me ask about your insurance situation. You mentioned you weren't insured, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right, no insurance. My wife and I… well, we’re on a fixed income, you see. We haven’t needed much medical care over the years, thankfully. But I’m worried about the cost of the MRI, to be honest. Will it be very expensive? I don’t want to put my wife out.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, MRIs are quite costly. Since you’re uninsured, we can discuss a few options. We can look into a financial assistance program at the hospital, or perhaps a payment plan. There are also some free-standing imaging centers that sometimes offer lower rates, but the quality can vary. Alternatively, we could start with conservative treatment – physical therapy and pain management – and see if that provides some relief before pursuing the MRI. However, without an image, we won't know the exact cause of your pain, and it may delay getting you the proper care. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a lot to think about. I really don't want to put my wife out, so a payment plan might be the best option. But I’m also worried about delaying treatment if it’s something serious. Hmm... Perhaps we could try the physical therapy first? See if that helps at all? If it doesn't, then we can look into the payment plan for the MRI. Would that be alright, Doctor? I'm willing to try anything to feel better, but I’m just worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: Alright. Physical therapy is a reasonable starting point. I'm going to write you a prescription for a course of treatment. I'll also give you some instructions for home exercises and a handout on proper lifting techniques. If you don’t see improvement after about four to six weeks, or if your pain worsens, then we'll revisit the imaging option. I want you to be aware that without an MRI, we're operating on a presumption, and there’s a small chance this could be something more serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Presumption... that’s a little scary. But I appreciate you being honest with me. And I’m willing to try the physical therapy. Four to six weeks... I can definitely commit to that. Do you think I should avoid gardening altogether during that time? Or can I do a little bit, just very carefully? My wife loves my tomatoes, you see.
DOCTOR: I would strongly advise against any gardening during those four to six weeks. No bending, no lifting, no kneeling. Absolutely none. Any activity that aggravates your pain will only set you back and prolong your recovery. Tomatoes are lovely, but your health is more important. We’ll re-evaluate after the therapy and see if you can gradually resume some activities then. Now, let me give you these instructions… and a referral to a physical therapist. They'll give you a more tailored program. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds… manageable. Although, no gardening is going to be tough. But I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I really do. I hope the physical therapy works. That’s all I’m hoping for.
DOCTOR: Alright. Keep me updated on your progress. If your pain gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms – numbness, weakness, fever, bowel or bladder changes – contact the office immediately. Otherwise, I'll see you back in four to six weeks. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I will. And I will contact you if anything changes. Have a good day to you too. .
