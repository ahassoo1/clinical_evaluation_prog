DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Schlatterer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Schlatterer. Erle Schlatterer. And frankly, Doctor… Ruocco, is it?… I have a great many things to attend to this afternoon. Let’s not dawdle. What exactly is this about? I was told it was… necessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the nurse flagged some… concerns on your chart. Routine check-up, mostly. Though, at your age, "routine" takes on a different meaning. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Concerns? Good heavens. I suppose… the library. It's been… taxing, lately. A great many… changes. Students these days… utterly lacking in discipline. Honestly, I’m not sure what they teach them anymore. It’s not what it used to be, not by a long shot. Is that what this is about? Some nonsense about my… stress levels? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Stress. Right. And this stress… how does it manifest?
PATIENT: Manifest? What a… peculiar word. Well, I find myself… less tolerant. Of… inefficiency, primarily. And the constant noise. They leave their… devices on, you see. Beeping and buzzing. Quite distracting when one is attempting to maintain order. And I sleep… less soundly. Though, that could be the neighbours’ dog. A dreadful little yap-yap thing. Is that sufficient? I haven't the time for a detailed recounting of my… discomforts.
DOCTOR: Less tolerant, disturbed sleep… And physically?
PATIENT: Physically…? Oh. Well. I… ache. A general… weariness. My back, mostly. Though I suspect that’s just… age. It wouldn’t be remarkable if it wasn't aching, at my age. I've always been quite… upright. Perhaps I’ve simply stood too much. Is there a point to this, Doctor? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of continuing my duties, despite a few… minor inconveniences.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And no recent falls or injuries?
PATIENT: Falls? Heavens, no! I am a man of… principle. And balance. I assure you. Though, last winter… there was a rather slippery patch on the sidewalk. I believe I stumbled, yes, but I recovered with… dignity. No harm done. It was the ice’s fault, entirely. A disgraceful lack of maintenance, if you ask me. Do we need to dwell on this, Doctor? I’m beginning to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s have a quick look, just to be thorough. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand up? Really? Is that… necessary? Very well. There. Perfectly steady, as you can see. Though I must say, this chair is rather… unsupportive. It lacks… lumbar support. Honestly, the standards these days…
DOCTOR: Yes, well… posture's a bit stooped, gait's slightly shuffling. Some mild weakness in the ankles. Can you push back against my hands?
PATIENT: Weakness? I assure you, Doctor, my strength is… adequate. There. Perfectly capable, as you can see. Though, I haven’t been… actively exercising, if that’s what you’re implying. I have more important matters to attend to than… frivolous physical activity. Honestly, the nerve. Is this getting us anywhere, Doctor? I have a meeting shortly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Honestly. All this… prodding. I suppose I can manage. There. Is that sufficient? I trust you won't require any further… indignities. I have a great deal on my mind, and this is… distracting.
DOCTOR: A little crackling in the lungs. Not alarming, but worth noting. Do you have any history of… respiratory issues?
PATIENT: Respiratory issues? Good heavens, no. I haven’t smoked a cigarette in… well, I’ve never smoked a cigarette. A perfectly healthy lifestyle, I assure you. Though, I did have a rather nasty cold last winter. A dreadful affair. But it was just a cold. The air conditioning in the library is… inadequate, you see. Perhaps that’s the source of this… “crackling.” Honestly, I suspect you’re making too much of nothing. Is this all? I really must be going. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, the lung sounds, and some mild weakness, I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work just to be safe. .
