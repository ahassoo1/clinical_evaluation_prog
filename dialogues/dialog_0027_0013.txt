DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s…it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It's been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Trouble with complete bladder emptying… how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Maybe…two, three months now? It started slowly, I guess. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it’s getting worse. It’s…uncomfortable, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Uncomfortable. And would you describe it as a weak stream, difficulty starting, or more of a feeling that you just can't empty your bladder completely?
PATIENT: It’s not really weak, Doctor. I can start alright. It feels like…like it stops before it’s all gone. Like there’s still some left in there, even when I try to push a little. It’s…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of incomplete emptying, even with straining. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I gotta go back to the bathroom pretty soon after I just went. Not right away, but… sooner than I used to. And…sometimes a little dribbling, after I think I’m finished. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency and some post-void dribbling. That's helpful to know. Now, have you had any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. No burning, nothing like that. It’s not painful, just…annoying. And like I said, uncomfortable. It’s just…not right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me see… No, I don't think so. It looks the same as always, I guess. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink plenty of water, so…I wouldn’t say it’s changed much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don't have much of one, thankfully. I had my prostate checked a few years back, but it was fine. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I lost my wife a few years ago, so I’m mostly just…taking it easy these days. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Hilber. Thank you for sharing that. And thank you for letting me know about the prostate check. Was that recent, within the last year?
PATIENT: Oh… no, it was longer than that. Maybe five, six years ago? It was right after she got sick, I think. I remember the doctor said everything looked good, but…that was a while back now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with any medicine before. I don’t take much, thankfully. Just a little something for my joints sometimes, when they’re acting up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That's okay with you, right?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Alright, I suppose so. Is it… unpleasant? I don't like being poked and prodded if I can help it.
DOCTOR: It's not too bad, Mr. Hilber. I'll just listen to your abdomen and do a quick exam of your prostate, to see if that feels enlarged or tender. It will only take a few moments. Would you mind if I checked your blood pressure as well?
PATIENT: A prostate exam, huh? Well… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Blood pressure is fine too, I guess. Just… try to be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope first. Just breathe normally. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m going to do a quick digital rectal exam to check your prostate. I will let you know each step as I proceed. Please try to relax. Okay. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, and a little tender to the touch. It doesn't feel particularly hard or irregular, which is good. Your rectum is clear. Blood pressure is 130/80.
PATIENT: Well… that wasn’t the most pleasant experience, Doctor. But thank you for explaining everything. Slightly enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Mr. Hilber. A slightly enlarged prostate, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men get older. It means your prostate gland has gotten bigger, which can put pressure on your urethra and cause the urinary symptoms you've been experiencing - difficulty emptying, frequency, dribbling. We can usually manage this with medication, or in some cases, other procedures. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We will need a urinalysis to check for infection and a PSA test to rule out prostate cancer, although your prostate didn’t feel concerning during the exam. Would you be willing to get those tests done?
PATIENT: Tests… alright, I suppose so. If it’ll help figure out what’s going on. Infection and…cancer? That sounds a little scary, Doctor. But if that’s what we need to do, then let’s do it. What does a urinalysis involve? And…how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. It’s good we are being thorough. A urinalysis is a simple urine test. You'll just need to provide a sample in a cup. The lab will check for infection, blood, and other abnormalities. The PSA test is a blood draw, it measures a protein produced by your prostate gland. The results usually take 2-3 business days. Once we have them, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water. If you can, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as those can irritate your bladder. If you experience any fever, pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now, Doctor. Just…try to keep it simple, alright? I don't understand all that medical talk. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate that. I suppose I’ll go get those tests done then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I will certainly keep it simple. The nurse will schedule those tests for you before you leave. If you have any questions at all once you get home, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We will follow up with you in a few days once the results are in. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Thank you for your time and for listening to me. I feel a little better knowing what might be going on, even if it’s just a possibility. You have a good day now, Doctor Fazzina.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and we’ll be in touch soon. .
