DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Auelua, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… going to the little boy’s room, you know. Too much. All the time. It’s a bother, really. Especially when I’m trying to get things done around the farm. My wife keeps saying I’m always disappearing... Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, just… it’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be disruptive, especially when you’ve got a farm to run. And it’s good you’re talking to your wife about it, keeping her in the loop is important. So, when you say “too much”, could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Oh, good heavens. What kind of detail does a man need to give about… that? It’s just… more often than it used to be, alright? Used to be, I’d go a few times a day, normal. Now? It feels like every hour, sometimes less. Especially if I drink anything. Tea, mostly. Can’t go a day without my tea. Though, maybe that’s the problem… I don’t rightly know. Everything’s a bit fuzzy these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to be embarrassed, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly normal to have changes like this, and we'll figure it out together. So, you’re saying it’s increased in frequency – more often than a few times a day, and especially after drinking tea. And you mentioned “fuzzy these days”. Are you having any other changes – like increased thirst, difficulty with memory, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, memory, yes. That’s a problem, alright. Forget where I put my keys, what I was saying mid-sentence… the usual old man stuff, I suppose. Thirst… not particularly. I drink my tea, and that’s usually enough. Sometimes a bit of water, but not a great deal. It’s mostly the going that’s the trouble. And… well, sometimes it’s a bit of a rush, if you catch my meaning. Not always, mind you, but… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Segretto. So, increased frequency, especially with tea, some memory issues, and occasionally a sense of urgency. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… you mean the color? Honestly, Doctor, I don't spend a great deal of time looking at it, if you don't mind my saying so. It's… yellow, mostly. Sometimes a bit darker if I haven’t had enough to drink, I suppose. I’m a farmer, not a… a urine expert! Is that a thing? Honestly, you young doctors ask the strangest questions.
DOCTOR: No, no urine experts, Mr. Segretto. Perfectly understandable. Just trying to get a complete picture. So, generally yellow, sometimes darker with less fluid intake. Now, have you ever had any problems with infections – like bladder infections or kidney infections – in the past?
PATIENT: Infections? Hmm… let me think. My wife, bless her heart, she handles most of that sort of thing. I had something… years ago, maybe? A bad pain, down low. Doctor gave me some pills, cleared it right up. But that was… decades ago, I’d wager. Can't recall the specifics, to be honest. Everything’s a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible infection decades ago, treated with pills. That’s helpful. And just one more question about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes… now there’s a word I remember hearing. My uncle, on my mother’s side, he had it. Terrible thing. But me? I don't think so. The doctor checks my numbers every so often, says they’re “fine”, but I don’t pay much attention. High blood pressure… maybe? Another one of those things my wife keeps track of. Says I worry too much. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be able to get through a day without having to run to the outhouse every hour!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like your wife is a great help in keeping track of things, and that’s excellent. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. And, if you’re comfortable, I’d also like to do a prostate exam. That will help me rule out some potential causes for your frequent urination.
PATIENT: A… a prostate exam? Now hold on just a minute. I’ve heard things about those. Not pleasant things. Is that absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, couldn't we just… try some pills first? Like the ones I had for that infection years ago? I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's a common concern. A prostate exam helps us assess the size and condition of your prostate gland, which can contribute to urinary issues, especially as men get older. It's a quick exam, and while it's not the most comfortable, it provides valuable information. We can start with some tests – a urine sample to check for infection and a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar. But to get a complete picture, a prostate exam would be very helpful in ruling out other possibilities. If we find nothing concerning in the tests, we can certainly discuss medication options. However, without a thorough assessment, we're just guessing. What do you think?
PATIENT: Well… when you put it like that. Guessing isn’t good. My wife always says I hate guessing. Alright, alright. Do your exam. Get it over with. But be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle, if you please. And… and don’t tell me what you’re doing every step of the way, alright? Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I won't explain everything as I go. I’ll just let you know when we’re starting. If you could please lie down on the examination table, face up, with your knees bent, that would be great. I’ll be right back with some lubricant and gloves. And please, let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, are you comfortable?
