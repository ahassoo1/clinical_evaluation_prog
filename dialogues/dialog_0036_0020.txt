DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth appointment, yes? My back is… not so good. A little pain, you know? It is not… emergency, but it is bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Not an emergency, but bothersome back pain. That’s good to know. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… hard to explain. It is not always there. Sometimes when I bend… or lift things. Sometimes just… sitting too long. It is… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not burning. Just… there. It is lower back, you understand? Not up high.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Lower back, dull ache, comes and goes with bending, lifting, or sitting for a long time. That helps. Now, when did this pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… maybe three months ago? It started… slowly. I was helping my grandson with the garden. Heavy bags of dirt, you know? I think that is when it started. It was not bad then, just a little stiff. It got worse slowly after that. I do not remember anything special happening to make it worse quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about three months ago with some gardening, lifting heavy bags of dirt, and has gradually worsened. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I take… what you call… pain pills. The ones my husband used to take. They help a little, but not much. And I put… warm packs on it. That feels good for a little while. I also try to not lift too much now, but… you know, sometimes I have to. My grandson, he is not so strong yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've tried over-the-counter pain relievers and warm packs, with some limited relief. You're also modifying your activity to avoid lifting when possible. Could you tell me what kind of pain relievers you’re taking, if you remember the name?
PATIENT: Hmm… the name… I am not so good with names. They are… white pills. Small, round. They were in a… orange bottle. My husband, he took them for his arthritis. I think… ibuprofen? Is that right? Yes, ibuprofen. That is what I remember. I take two when it hurts bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen. And how often are you taking those two pills?
PATIENT: Oh… not so often. Maybe… two or three times a week? When it really bothers me. I do not like to take too many pills, you know? They make me… sleepy. And I do not want to be sleepy. I need to help my grandson.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen two or three times a week as needed. I understand wanting to limit medication use. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. No tingling. My legs are… okay. I walk, I can stand. Everything feels… normal there. I worry sometimes, but it is not numb or… pins and needles, like my sister had. No, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Problems? No… no problems. Everything is… regular. Sorry, Doctor, I do not understand. You mean… when I go to the bathroom? Everything is normal there too. I do not have trouble, no. Is that what you are asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking, Ms. Benites, and I appreciate you clarifying. No changes in bladder or bowel function. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My husband, he had the high blood pressure. I… I had a little trouble with my heart, a long time ago. But the doctor said it was okay now. He gave me pills for a while, but I do not take them anymore. Arthritis… maybe a little in my hands, but not bad. Nothing serious, I think. Oh, and I had… gallbladder problems. They took it out, many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in the family, a past heart issue that's currently resolved, some mild arthritis in the hands, and gallbladder surgery in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything. I can take any medicine. My husband, he was allergic to… something in the cats. But I like cats! I do not have allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the ibuprofen when needed?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Just the ibuprofen when my back hurts. That is all. I do not like to take too many pills, you know? I try to stay healthy. I walk, I eat good food. I do not need many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'm going to check your back, feel for any tenderness, and check your range of motion. We’ll also check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? My back is… sensitive. But I want to know what is wrong. So, yes, you can check.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on your stomach on the exam table. Okay. I'm going to feel along your spine now. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Alright, I'm noticing some tenderness along your lower spine, especially on the right side. Not severe, but definitely present. And there is some muscle spasm in that area as well. Now, I'm going to ask you to try and bend forward, sideways, and backward as comfortably as you can. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Okay. Bending… forward… Ooh, that is… a little uncomfortable. Not sharp, but… I feel it. Mostly on the right side, like you said. And sideways… Right side is… worse. Left side is okay. And backward… That is… not so bad. But I do not bend very far. It is… scary to bend. I do not want to fall.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're letting me know what you’re feeling. You have limited range of motion, particularly when bending to the right. And you’re right to be cautious; we don’t want to overdo it. Okay, I’m checking your reflexes and strength in your legs now. Everything seems normal there. Strength is good, and reflexes are intact. Alright, Ms. Benites. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by lifting. It doesn’t seem to be anything more serious, like a nerve compression or fracture, but we should confirm this with an X-ray. Would you be comfortable getting an X-ray today?
PATIENT: X-ray? Hmm… I do not like the… the machine. Is it… necessary? I do not want too much… radiation. But… if you think it is important… yes. If it will tell you what is wrong, yes. But please, do not take too many pictures? And… is it expensive? I have Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about radiation, Ms. Benites. The amount of radiation from a lower back X-ray is quite low, and the benefits of ruling out other potential causes outweigh the risks in this case. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on, especially since you’ve had some pain for a few months now. And yes, Medicare should cover the cost of the X-ray. Our billing department will verify that for you, and we’ll let you know if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. If the X-ray confirms a simple muscle strain, we can start with conservative treatment: physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and careful attention to your posture and lifting technique. If it shows anything else, we’ll discuss the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Physical therapy… I can try that. And the pain pills, I already have those. Posture… I try to sit up straight. Lifting… that is the hard part. I have to help my grandson. So… X-ray first, then physical therapy? And you will tell me what the X-ray shows? That is okay. Thank you, Doctor. You are very… kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. X-ray first, then we’ll discuss the results and start with physical therapy if it confirms a muscle strain. I will explain everything to you in detail, and we'll work together to create a plan that helps you feel better. I’ll have the technician come in and take you to get the X-ray. It should only take a few minutes. Then you can come back, and we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Just… thank you, Doctor. You made me feel… less worried. I am ready for the X-ray.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. Okay, let's go get that X-ray done. I'll see you right back here after. Please let me or the technician know if you feel any discomfort during the procedure.
