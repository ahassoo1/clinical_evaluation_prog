DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you. It’s been… hard.
DOCTOR: Cancer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I… I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. They just said it was… bad. And I should come get checked out. It's in my… well, everywhere, I think. They didn’t explain it very well.
DOCTOR: "Everywhere" is… vague, Chellsea. Let's try to be a bit more specific. Do you have any records from whoever told you this?
PATIENT: No, sir. I… my husband, he took care of all that. He… he passed away last month. I don’t have any papers or anything. He handled all the doctor visits and… and the information. I just… I just know I’m supposed to be here because of the cancer. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Well, that complicates things. It’s…unfortunate your husband isn’t here to provide details. So you’re telling me you were diagnosed with cancer, but you have no idea what kind, where it started, or what treatment you’ve received?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s… that’s right. He said it was… aggressive. And he was always trying to protect me from worrying, so he did all the talking with the doctors. I just… went along. Now… now I don’t know anything. It feels like I’m starting over.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… less than ideal, Chellsea. Honestly, relying entirely on another person for your medical care is… unwise. But alright. We’ll have to start from scratch. Let's start with the basics. Do you have any symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I… I get very tired. All the time. Even after sleeping. And I've lost weight, even though I'm eating. My bones… they hurt. A lot. And sometimes it’s hard to breathe. I just thought it was… grief, at first. But it hasn’t gotten better.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, weight loss, bone pain, shortness of breath… those are all… nonspecific symptoms, Chellsea. Many things can cause those. Have you noticed any lumps or bumps anywhere?
PATIENT: No, sir. I haven’t. I… I check sometimes, but I haven’t felt anything unusual. It's mostly just the tiredness and the pain. And the breathing. It gets worse when I walk, even just a little bit. I try not to tell anyone, because I don’t want to worry them. It feels silly, maybe?
DOCTOR: "Silly"?
PATIENT: No, sir, not you. I just… my friends, they’ve been so nice since my husband passed. I don’t want to burden them with my problems. They've been through enough. I should be strong, I think. But it’s… hard. Especially not knowing what’s going on with… all of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. Look, feeling sorry for yourself isn’t going to solve anything. We need to get some tests done to figure out what’s going on. I’m going to need to do a physical exam. Then we'll get some blood work and, likely, imaging. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's happening. And… if there’s anything that can be done. I’m ready for the tests, if you are. I’m sorry if I'm being difficult. I just… I’m scared.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get started. Please lie down on the table. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. And then we’ll move on to palpating your abdomen. Try to relax. Breathing is slightly labored. Auscultation reveals… diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not… not really. It’s just… tender, all over. It’s hard to explain. Like a dull ache, everywhere. It doesn’t feel like one specific spot. It just… hurts when you push on it. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Diffuse tenderness, as you say. No distinct masses palpable. Slightly distended abdomen. Let’s check your lymph nodes. No significant lymphadenopathy detected. Palpable, but within normal limits. Alright. That’s the physical exam, for now. We'll need those blood tests. And I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis.
PATIENT: Okay, sir. Blood tests and… X-ray and CT scan. I understand. Where do I go for those? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to arrange for someone to be with me, I think.
DOCTOR: Here. This requisition is for the blood work. You can go to any LabCorp location. As for the imaging, this order is for City Imaging, just down the street. They’ll schedule you. Results typically take 24 to 48 hours. I'll have the nurse call you with the results. Don’t call me directly with questions. The nurse is better equipped to handle those. And frankly, Chellsea, I suggest you find a support system. This isn’t something you should be going through alone.
PATIENT: Okay, sir. Thank you. LabCorp and City Imaging. And I’ll wait for the nurse to call. I… I do have a friend. I think she can help. Thank you for… everything. .
DOCTOR: Alright. That'll be all. Next. .
