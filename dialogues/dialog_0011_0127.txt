DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit… worrying, to be honest. I’ve been noticing some weakness, especially in my muscles, and my eyelids are starting to droop. It’s been getting progressively worse over the last few months, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in to have this evaluated, Mr. Schaust. Progressive muscle weakness and drooping eyelids – that does warrant a thorough examination. To help me understand what's going on, let's start with the muscle weakness. Can you describe where you're experiencing it most prominently?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started in my legs, I believe. It’s harder to climb stairs now, and I get tired quicker when I’m walking any distance. It’s… not a sudden weakness, more like a fatigue that doesn’t go away with rest. Now, it’s also in my arms, making it difficult to lift things. It’s not painful, exactly, just… heavy. And harder to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, progressive fatigue and weakness starting in the legs and now affecting your arms. That's helpful. You mentioned it doesn’t improve with rest. Is there anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I suppose… prolonged use, definitely. Like, if I’m doing yard work for a few hours, it gets significantly worse. And… honestly, sometimes even just after a long day at work, it’s much more noticeable. It doesn’t seem to be affected by what I’m doing, just how long I’m doing it. I haven’t noticed anything specific that makes it better, other than just… stopping and resting. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Schaust. The correlation with prolonged use is important. And the fact that rest provides some relief. Now, let's talk about the drooping eyelids – you mentioned they’ve been getting worse. Is it both eyelids, or just one?
PATIENT: It’s both, Doctor. But… the left one is definitely worse than the right. I’ve noticed it especially when I’m tired, or if I’ve been looking at a screen for a long time. It makes me feel… self-conscious, to be honest. And it’s starting to affect my vision a little bit, I think. I find myself raising my eyebrows to keep my eyes open.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be concerning. Drooping eyelids affecting your vision is something we need to investigate. Have you noticed any double vision, or blurring, in addition to the drooping?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little bit of blurring, sometimes. It’s not constant, and it’s usually worse later in the day. And… occasionally, when I’m very tired, I think I have seen double, but it’s fleeting. It’s hard to say for sure if it’s just my eyes being tired, or something more. I haven't really paid much attention to it until now, if I'm honest. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It's quite common to dismiss symptoms initially, Mr. Schaust, so don't feel concerned about that. The intermittent blurring and occasional double vision, in conjunction with the weakness and drooping eyelids, are certainly things we need to explore further. Before we proceed with a physical exam, let's briefly cover some other areas. Have you experienced any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Swallowing is fine, and my speech hasn't been affected at all. No difficulty there. I've also noticed no changes in my sense of taste or smell. Just the fatigue, the weakness, and the eyelids… it’s been a bit worrying, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Schaust, and we’ll certainly work to determine the cause. Thank you for providing this detailed information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. This will involve checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and a neurological assessment. We'll also take a closer look at your eyelids and assess your vision. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I'd rather get it checked out thoroughly than worry about it any longer.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, please sit up straight on the examination table. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'll be tapping on your knees and ankles with this small hammer. This is perfectly normal, and shouldn't cause any discomfort. Okay, reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's assess your muscle strength. I’m going to ask you to resist my force as I push or pull on your arms and legs. Please push back as hard as you can. We'll do this on both sides. Okay… Strength is 4/5 in all major muscle groups, with some mild fatigue noted in the proximal muscles, particularly after repeated effort. Now, I'm going to examine your eyelids more closely. I'm looking for the degree of ptosis, and I'll also assess your pupillary responses and extraocular movements. The ptosis is more pronounced on the left side. Pupillary responses are normal. Extraocular movements are slightly limited in upward gaze. Finally, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your lymph nodes, just to get a complete picture. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Alright, Mr. Schaust. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and my findings today, I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone level. I also want to order an acetylcholine receptor antibody test and a Tensilon test to rule out Myasthenia Gravis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… comprehensive, Doctor, which is reassuring. Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Myasthenia Gravis… that sounds rather serious. Is that what you suspect? I understand you need to rule things out, but it’s a bit concerning to hear that name.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, Mr. Schaust. Myasthenia Gravis can be serious, but it is also treatable. The symptoms you've described – progressive muscle weakness, drooping eyelids, and fatigue – are all consistent with Myasthenia Gravis, but they can also be caused by other conditions. That's why it's important to run these tests to get an accurate diagnosis. The Tensilon test involves injecting a small amount of medication and observing your muscle strength for any improvement. It's generally well-tolerated, but we will monitor you closely during the procedure. While we wait for the results, I would advise you to avoid strenuous activities and get plenty of rest. If you notice any worsening of your symptoms, particularly difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests, the potential diagnosis, or the precautions I've mentioned?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything you’ve said, Doctor. Just to be clear, the Tensilon test… it involves an injection? And you’ll be monitoring me closely for any improvement in strength? That sounds… a bit nerve-wracking, but I understand it’s necessary. And thank you for the advice about avoiding strenuous activity and going to the emergency room if things worsen. I will definitely keep that in mind. What's the typical turnaround time for these blood tests? I suppose I’m just anxious to get some answers, and get started on whatever treatment might be necessary.
DOCTOR: You are right to be anxious for answers, Mr. Schaust, and I understand your concern about the Tensilon test. We will have a nurse explain the procedure in detail before we proceed, and we’ll be monitoring your vital signs and muscle strength continuously throughout. As for the blood tests, the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone level typically take 24-48 hours to come back. The acetylcholine receptor antibody test and Tensilon test may take a bit longer, closer to 3-5 business days, as they require specialized processing. I will have the lab technician draw the blood samples today, and we will contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of before proceeding with the Tensilon test?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And no pre-existing medical conditions to speak of. I had a bout of the flu a few years ago, but nothing serious. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. I think that’s everything, then. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a bit better knowing we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on. I appreciate your attention to detail.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I am glad I could provide some reassurance. It is my priority to provide you with the best possible care. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood samples and discuss the details of the Tensilon test. If you have any questions before she arrives, please don’t hesitate to ask. In the meantime, I’ll have my assistant prepare a summary of today’s visit, including the list of tests ordered and the precautions we’ve discussed, and email it to you for your records. Thank you again for coming in today, Mr. Schaust. We will be in touch soon with the results.
PATIENT: .
