DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly? This tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet. Been going on a little while now, and it’s just… annoying. I’m Teretha, by the way. Don't mind if I call you Dimitri, do I? Just feels friendlier, you know?
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, while I appreciate the…offer, Dr. Mutnick will suffice. And “a little while” is rather imprecise. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Sorry, sorry. Dmitri... Doctor. It’s been… maybe three, four months? Hard to say exactly, things blend together when you get to be my age. It started off just a little prickling, like when your foot falls asleep. But now it’s more constant, you know? Not painful, exactly, just… there. Especially when I'm sorting mail. It makes things harder.
DOCTOR: Three to four months…sorting mail… Very well. And is this tingling in both hands and feet, or just one of each?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both hands, both feet. Though, if I had to pick, my right hand feels it a little worse. It's the one I use more, naturally. All those envelopes… it gets tiring, you know? Not just the tingling, everything.
DOCTOR: Right hand more pronounced... Do you experience any weakness in either hand or foot?
PATIENT: Weakness? Not really… not like I can’t do things. But sometimes, I drop things. Envelopes, mostly. And I have to…concentrate more to hold onto things. Like opening jars, or gripping the steering wheel. It's not a big weakness, it's just...fidgety, I guess? Hard to explain. It’s just harder than it used to be, that's all.
DOCTOR: “Fidgety” is not a medical term, Ms. Uzarski. Have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t think so. I mean, I’m old, my skin is wrinkly, but no changes. No rashes, no blisters, no… nothing like that. Just… old skin. I’ve always been careful in the sun, you know? My mother always said… well, never mind what my mother said. It's just regular old skin.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not really. Well, my knees bother me sometimes, arthritis, the doctor said years ago. But that's just old age again, I think. And my blood pressure gets a little high, but I try to watch my salt. Nothing serious. I lost my husband, God rest his soul, a few years back, but that's not… medical, is it?
DOCTOR: Arthritis, hypertension…Do you take any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. He… my husband, he always handled the doctor stuff. And after he was gone, I just… never got around to it. It wasn’t bothering me too much, you know? Just took some ibuprofen when my knees really flared up. And tried not to eat too much salt. I'm not much for taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Please, lie down on the table. We'll need to perform a brief neurological exam. It’s quite simple, just follow my instructions. This is to assess your reflexes and sensation. And please, try to be precise. Imprecision wastes time.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Neurological… that sounds…serious. But if you say it's simple, I trust you. Just tell me what to do, and I'll try my best. As precise as I can be, you said? I’ll try. Old knees aren't what they used to be, though, so give me a moment to get up there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Close your eyes. Now, tell me if I am touching your hands or feet, and where. Do not anticipate. Simply respond when you feel the sensation.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor, eyes closed. Ready. … Now? … Yes! My right hand… just there, on the back of my hand. … And… now my left foot. … Yes, right there, on the… the side, I think. … Wait… yes, my right foot now, on the…the top? Is that right? It's a little… faint, Doctor. Hard to say exactly. It's not as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Diminished sensation in both extremities, more pronounced on the right… Now, let me test your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I will tap just below your kneecap.
PATIENT: Okay, relaxing... Oh! That tickles! …Is that right? Did it… do anything? It felt… small. Was it supposed to kick, or something? It didn’t really kick. Maybe a little twitch? It's hard to tell, Doctor. Honestly, it just tickled.
DOCTOR: Ankle reflexes now, Ms. Uzarski.
PATIENT: Okay, ankles now. Here we go... Oh! That felt a little stronger than my knees, I think. A little twitch, yes, I felt it. Not a big one, but a twitch. Everything alright, Doctor? You look… serious. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Diminished sensation, reduced reflexes… Ms. Uzarski, your reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Given your symptoms and these findings, it is likely you are experiencing peripheral neuropathy. In simpler terms, there is nerve damage in your hands and feet. However, further testing is required to determine the cause of this neuropathy. This could be due to several factors, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or other underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Neuropathy…nerve damage? Oh dear. Is it… serious? Will I have to…have surgery? Diabetes? I don't think I have diabetes. My husband… he was the one who worried about all that. And vitamin deficiencies? I eat alright, I think. Mostly soup and sandwiches… What kind of testing do I need? And… is there anything I can do? It’s just… I need to sort mail, Doctor. It’s my job.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, please try to remain calm. Surgery is unlikely at this stage. We need to identify the underlying cause before discussing any definitive treatment plan. I will order a comprehensive blood panel, including a fasting glucose test to rule out diabetes, a vitamin B12 level, and thyroid function tests. We will also need to assess your kidney function. Furthermore, I recommend a nerve conduction study, which will provide a more detailed assessment of the nerve damage. In the meantime, avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms. And please, do not self-medicate. If the tingling becomes unbearable, you may try over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, but do not exceed the recommended dosage. I will provide you with a list of local labs where you can have these tests performed. I am also referring you to a neurologist for a consultation. They specialize in nerve disorders and will be able to provide further guidance. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh my… that’s… a lot. Blood tests, a neurologist… and avoid activities… That makes it hard to sort mail, Doctor. How long will it take to get the results? And…what if it is diabetes? Is that…bad? I’ve never had anything seriously wrong with me before. And the neurologist… will they want to do…more tests? I don’t like tests, Doctor. They make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, I understand your concerns, but delaying testing will only complicate matters. The blood tests should be completed within a week. The neurologist’s appointment may take a bit longer to schedule, depending on their availability. If it is diabetes, it can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication. However, early detection is crucial. As for further testing… the neurologist will determine the appropriate course of action. I cannot preempt their clinical judgment. I have provided you with a referral and a list of labs. It is your responsibility to schedule these appointments promptly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. It’s just…a lot to take in. And I don't have anyone to help me, you know? My husband…he always made the appointments and drove me and… everything. I’ll… I'll try, Doctor. I promise. I’ll try to get it all done. Thank you… I think. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do. Some people… honestly.
