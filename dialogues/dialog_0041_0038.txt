DOCTOR: Hi Evann, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Polczynski. Um… well, to be frank, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I was advised to come and discuss… arrangements, should I become unable to make decisions for myself. Something about a form? I believe it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form. I’m terribly vague on the details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. That's perfectly alright, Evann. It is a bit complex. An Advance Directive and a POLST form... both are about planning for the future, making sure your wishes are known if you can't speak for yourself. Let's start with the Advance Directive. It's a document that outlines your healthcare preferences – things like what kind of treatments you want, or don't want, in various medical situations. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. It rings a bell. It was a friend, I believe, who suggested it. She mentioned something about… not wanting to be kept alive by machines, if there was no hope. It all feels rather… morbid, to be honest. I apologize for being so hesitant. My memory isn't what it once was, and I find discussing such things… unsettling. Is it necessary to detail everything?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not! It's perfectly understandable to find it unsettling, and you don't have to detail anything you're not comfortable with. It's your document, and it should reflect your wishes. We can go over it bit by bit, and you decide how much detail you want to include. Let me pull up a basic form here. We can start with just a general idea of what's important to you. Do you have any immediate concerns or things you definitely wouldn't want, even in a serious situation?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be a burden. And… prolonged suffering, if there’s truly no chance of recovery. I’ve seen… things. I used to travel quite a bit, and… well, it’s best not to dwell on it. I do feel strongly about maintaining dignity, if that makes sense. As for specific treatments… I honestly don’t know enough to say. I’m quite ignorant of medical procedures, I'm afraid. Would it be helpful to have a list of possibilities? Perhaps with simple explanations?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Evann, thank you for sharing that. "Not wanting to be a burden" and "avoiding prolonged suffering" are very common and important wishes. And maintaining dignity is crucial. It's perfectly okay to not be familiar with medical procedures – that's what I'm here for. I can definitely show you a list of possibilities, with simple explanations. It covers things like CPR, mechanical ventilation , feeding tubes, dialysis... We don't have to go through everything today. We can just look at the ones that seem most relevant to you. How about we start with CPR?
PATIENT: CPR… yes, I’ve seen that on television. Is that the… chest compressions? And… breathing into someone’s mouth? It seems… rather aggressive. Is it always successful? I suppose… if it’s unlikely to work, I wouldn’t want to… be subjected to it. But if there’s a good chance… then perhaps. It’s all so confusing. What are the risks involved? Would it break bones, for instance? I apologize for being so… inquisitive.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize at all! You're asking excellent questions. It is confusing, and you have every right to be inquisitive. CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, involves chest compressions and sometimes mouth-to-mouth breathing to try and restart the heart. It’s often shown on TV, so it can seem dramatic. The success rate varies greatly depending on the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest, and the person’s overall health. It's more likely to be successful if started quickly. As for risks… yes, there are risks. It can sometimes cause broken ribs, even with proper technique. There’s also a risk of internal injuries, though that’s less common. And it doesn’t always work, as I mentioned. For your Advance Directive, you can specify whether you want CPR attempted in certain situations. You can say you want it attempted at all costs, you want it attempted unless the chances of success are very low, or you don't want it attempted at all. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that clarifies things somewhat. "Unless the chances of success are very low"… that seems reasonable. But… who determines what “very low” means? Is that a medical judgment? And if so… how accurate are those judgments? I’m terribly sorry to be such a difficult patient. I just… I don’t want to leave things to chance. It feels… disempowering to rely on someone else’s assessment of my chances. Perhaps… perhaps we should move on to the next item on the list? The breathing machine, you said?
DOCTOR: You're not difficult at all, Evann. Your questions are very important, and it’s good that you’re thinking these things through. You're right to be concerned about who determines "very low." That's where it gets a bit complex. "Very low" is generally determined by the medical team, based on your overall health, the severity of your condition, and the likelihood of a successful outcome. It's not an exact science, and there's always some degree of uncertainty. We would, of course, discuss the risks and benefits with you and your family, if possible, before making any decisions. And you’re right to want control. The goal of this document is to give you that control. Let's move on to mechanical ventilation, the breathing machine. It helps with breathing when someone can't breathe on their own. Would you like me to explain what that entails, and what your options are regarding it?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Ventilation… I believe I’ve seen that in films as well. A tube… down the throat? It looks… unpleasant. And is it painful? And… for how long would someone be on a machine like that? Would they be conscious? I’m also concerned about… infections. I’ve heard that tubes can lead to pneumonia. It all sounds… quite frightening. Perhaps a simple explanation of the best-case and worst-case scenarios would be helpful? I realize I'm asking a great deal, but I feel… unprepared for such decisions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking a great deal at all, Evann. It's perfectly normal to feel unprepared, and it’s good that you’re asking these questions. Mechanical ventilation involves inserting a tube into your airway – either through your mouth or nose – and connecting it to a machine that helps you breathe. It's used when someone can't breathe adequately on their own, due to illness or injury. As for your concerns… Yes, it can be uncomfortable, and sometimes painful, particularly initially. We use medication to minimize discomfort. As for how long… it can range from a few hours to several days, or even weeks, depending on the underlying cause. You’re right about infections – there is a risk of pneumonia and other respiratory infections with prolonged ventilation. We take precautions to minimize that risk. Let’s talk about best-case and worst-case scenarios. Best-case: The ventilator supports your breathing until your lungs recover, and you're able to breathe on your own again. Worst-case: The ventilator may not be able to improve your breathing, and you may require long-term ventilation, or it may not be effective in preventing further decline. For your Advance Directive, you can specify whether you want to be placed on a ventilator in certain situations, or whether you want it withdrawn if it’s not improving your condition. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… it makes a degree of sense. But… what constitutes “not improving”? Is that determined by the same medical team who assessed the chances of success with the CPR? And… if they determine it’s not improving, would there be a trial period? Or would it be an immediate decision? I’m also… apprehensive about being completely reliant on a machine. It feels… undignified. Would it be possible to have a “time limit”? Perhaps a week, or ten days? If there’s no improvement within that timeframe, then… withdraw it? I realize that’s a rather drastic request, but I feel… strongly about maintaining some semblance of control, even in such a dire situation. I apologize for being so… demanding. It's just… this is all so difficult to contemplate.
DOCTOR: You're not being demanding at all, Evann. These are very valid concerns, and I appreciate you being so open and honest about your feelings. It is difficult to contemplate, and it's good that you're thinking these things through. You're right to ask about who determines "not improving." It would be the same medical team, including myself and potentially other specialists, depending on your condition. We would base our assessment on various factors, including your breathing patterns, blood oxygen levels, and overall health. And yes, there would definitely be a trial period. We wouldn't withdraw ventilation without careful consideration and discussion with you, if possible, and your family. As for a time limit… that's absolutely something we can include in your Advance Directive. You can specify a timeframe, such as a week or ten days, after which ventilation would be withdrawn if there’s no improvement. It's your decision, and we would honor your wishes. We can also add specific criteria for what constitutes "improvement," such as a certain level of oxygen saturation or the ability to breathe independently for a certain amount of time. The goal is to give you as much control as possible and ensure your wishes are respected. Let’s start documenting these preferences. We can go through each item one by one, and I’ll make sure everything is clearly stated. Would you like me to start with the time limit for ventilation, and the criteria for improvement?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be most helpful. Starting with the time limit… let’s say ten days. And as for criteria… if there’s no significant improvement in oxygen saturation, and no ability to breathe independently for at least… thirty minutes, then… that would be my preference. I also… I would like it explicitly stated that I do not wish to be kept alive artificially if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery. I realize that’s a rather broad statement, but it’s… important to me. And… if there’s any deterioration in cognitive function, then… please, do not prolong the process. I apologize for being so… specific. I just… want to be absolutely clear about my wishes. This is… a great relief, actually. Thank you, Doctor Polczynski.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. These are very clear and important preferences, and I'm happy to document them for you. "Ten days with no significant improvement in oxygen saturation and no ability to breathe independently for at least thirty minutes," and the explicit statement about not wishing to be kept alive artificially with no reasonable hope of recovery, and especially addressing any deterioration in cognitive function… all noted. I'm also adding a clause specifying that these wishes apply as long as I am deemed mentally competent to make my own decisions. If there’s any question about my competency, we would consult with a qualified psychiatrist. Is there anything else you'd like to add at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers the most important aspects. Perhaps… perhaps we should discuss the feeding tube next? But… if you don’t mind, could we take a brief pause? I feel… rather drained. Just a few moments to collect my thoughts. I apologize for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. No inconvenience at all. This is a lot to process, and it's perfectly okay to take a break. Why don’t you take a few moments to collect your thoughts. I’ll be right here when you’re ready to continue. Perhaps a glass of water?
PATIENT: That would be most kind, thank you. Just… a few moments to breathe.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Evann. No rush at all. I'll be right here when you're ready.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. I… I appreciate your patience. It’s… difficult to confront these things. Perhaps… perhaps we should discuss the feeding tube. I’ve heard that can be… quite unpleasant. And… is it always necessary? If someone is unable to eat, is it the only option? I apologize for continuing to ask so many questions, but I feel… unprepared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Evann. It's good that you're asking them. It's my job to provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions. Let's talk about feeding tubes. A feeding tube involves inserting a tube into your stomach or small intestine to provide nourishment if you're unable to eat on your own. It can be necessary in certain situations, such as after a stroke or surgery, or if you have a condition that prevents you from swallowing safely. As for whether it's always necessary… no, it’s not. There are other options, such as intravenous fluids, which provide hydration and some nutrients. However, intravenous fluids don't provide all the nourishment your body needs in the long term. As for the unpleasantness… it can be uncomfortable initially, but we use medication to minimize discomfort. There are different types of feeding tubes, and some are more comfortable than others. There are also potential complications, such as infection or blockage, but we take precautions to minimize those risks. For your Advance Directive, you can specify whether you want to be considered for a feeding tube in certain situations, or whether you want it withheld if it's unlikely to improve your quality of life. Would you like to discuss your preferences regarding that?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. I believe… I believe I would prefer to withhold it, if it’s unlikely to improve my quality of life. I’ve seen… I’ve seen people kept alive artificially, and it wasn’t a pleasant sight. If there’s no reasonable hope of recovery, then… I don’t want to be subjected to it. But… what constitutes “reasonable hope”? Is that the same medical team who assessed the chances of success with the other procedures? And… if they determine there’s no reasonable hope, would there be a trial period? A week, perhaps? If there’s no improvement in cognitive function within that timeframe, then… please, withhold it. I apologize for repeating myself, but it’s… important to me. It feels… undignified to be kept alive without any quality of life. Is that… a reasonable request?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That is a very reasonable request, and I completely understand your concerns. You’ve been very clear about your wishes, and I’m happy to document them for you. “Withhold feeding tube if unlikely to improve quality of life, if there is no reasonable hope of recovery, and if there’s no improvement in cognitive function within one week.” I’m adding a clause specifying that the medical team assessing the "reasonable hope" and cognitive function would be the same team who assessed the chances of success with the other procedures. As for a trial period, one week is absolutely reasonable. We would carefully monitor your cognitive function during that timeframe, and if there’s no improvement, we would withhold the feeding tube. We would also, of course, discuss this with your family, if possible. Is there anything else you'd like to add regarding the feeding tube, or would you like to move on to another topic?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers it. I think… I think we’ve addressed all of my concerns. It feels… empowering to have these things documented. Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been… incredibly patient and understanding. I apologize for being so… demanding. Perhaps… perhaps a copy of this document for my records? And… would it be possible to have a copy sent to my solicitor?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure. And you weren't demanding at all. It's my job to ensure you feel comfortable and informed, and I'm glad we were able to address all of your concerns. Absolutely, I can definitely provide you with a copy of the document for your records, and I can also send a copy to your solicitor. Just provide me with their contact information. Here you are. Please review it carefully and let me know if you have any questions or would like to make any changes. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been… a great help. I feel… much more at peace now. I suppose… I should be going. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the future. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
