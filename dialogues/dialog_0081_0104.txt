DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s my throat. It’s been… bothering me. Not a good bother, you understand. Just… painful. I need to get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: "Quickly" is relative, Ms. Ottaviani. We need to understand what we're sorting, precisely. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It hurts when I swallow. And… it feels scratchy. Like sandpaper, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, I don't have time for a lot of details. I just want something for it. Is that so hard to understand? It’s been… a few days, I think. Perhaps longer. I really couldn’t say.
DOCTOR: "A few days," right. And is there anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Better? Hmm. Drinking tea… sometimes. But it has to be a specific kind. Not all teas. And worse… talking, naturally. Which is why I’m not enjoying this very much. It's just... aggravating it. Honestly, Doctor, I work with machinery all day. I don't have time for a sore throat or lengthy explanations.
DOCTOR: "Machinery," you say. And have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose accompanying this… aggravation?
PATIENT: Fever? I haven't taken my temperature. Chills… maybe a little cold yesterday, but that’s the air conditioning. And a cough? No, no cough. Just the throat. Look, Doctor, are you going to do something, or are we just going to sit here and talk about the weather? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, a proper assessment requires information. I assure you, I am not discussing the weather. Now, have you had any difficulty breathing, or any swelling in your neck?
PATIENT: Breathing? Yes, I’m breathing, thank you very much! What sort of question is that? And swelling… no. I would know if my neck was swelling. Honestly, Doctor, I am a practical woman. I notice things. It’s just a sore throat. A very irritating sore throat. Can we please get this over with? I don’t understand why this is taking so long. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a look, then. Please, open your mouth and say "Ah." And I would appreciate it if you could refrain from… commentary during the examination.
