DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti, and I'll be your physician today. I see you're 53 years old. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s… it’s about my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It just… stops, even when I feel like there’s more there. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder, and this has been going on for about a month. That can certainly be concerning. To help me understand this better, could you describe what this feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it feels like… like when you try to get the last bit of water out of a bottle, you know? You gotta push and squeeze, and sometimes it just… won't come. It's not painful, not usually. Just… frustrating. And sometimes, after I think I’m done, a little bit comes out later. Not a lot, but enough to… bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like incomplete emptying, requiring effort, and you're noticing some dribbling afterwards. Not painful, just bothersome. That's helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I guess I have to go to the bathroom more often than I used to, maybe. Not all the time, but I seem to be thinking about it more. And… well, my legs have been a little… swollen lately. I thought it was just the heat, we've had some warm weather, but maybe it's something else? I don't know. I haven't been sleeping as well either, but that could be a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency, some leg swelling, and difficulty sleeping. We’ll definitely want to look into all of those. Regarding the leg swelling, could you tell me where exactly you're noticing it?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my ankles and feet, Doctor. Both of them. Not bad enough to be really painful, just… puffy. I can still get my shoes on, but they feel a little tighter than usual. It seems worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles and feet, worse at the end of the day after being on your feet. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. My wife… she always took care of all that. After she passed… it just didn’t seem as important, I guess. I’m on Medicare, if that helps? I try to stay healthy. I walk when I can, and I eat… well, I try to eat okay. I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it's common for things like healthcare to take a backseat. I appreciate you being so open with me. Medicare is helpful information, and it’s good to hear you’re active and generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing. They set it in a cast. And… my wife, she had her gallbladder out a few years before she passed. I was with her for that, of course. But me? Not really. Nothing major. I've just always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child, and you were with your wife during her gallbladder surgery. No significant surgical history for you personally. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. He was a fisherman, hard work, lots of cold weather. And my grandfather, on my mother's side, he had something with his kidneys, I think. But… that was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. We didn’t talk about those things much back then. My mother, she was healthy as a horse, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart disease in your father, potential kidney issues in your grandfather, and a healthy mother. That's helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't take anything regularly. Not even vitamins. I used to take something for my knees, years ago, when they bothered me, but I stopped. I just try to take it easy now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. Alright, Mr. Hilber. With your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a neurological exam to assess reflexes and sensation. We'll also check your prostate with a digital rectal exam, if you're comfortable with that, as it can provide important information given your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… a prostate exam? I’ve heard things… it doesn’t sound very pleasant. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes, I guess. I want to figure out what’s going on. Just… be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber, and I assure you I'll be as gentle and quick as possible. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for urinary issues, and it can give us valuable information. It usually only takes a moment. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll also gently palpate your abdomen to feel for any abnormalities. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, if you could turn onto your side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest, we'll proceed with the digital rectal exam. I'll let you know when I'm finished.
PATIENT: Okay… here goes. Just… try to be quick, like you said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. That's all done. The prostate feels mildly enlarged, but smooth. There were no obvious nodules or tenderness. Now, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men as they age, where the prostate gland enlarges and can cause difficulty with urination. However, to be certain and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests. I'm going to order a urine analysis to check for infection or other abnormalities, a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to help assess your prostate health, and a kidney function test. We should also get a complete blood count. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If you think those tests are needed, then yes, please. I just want to know what’s wrong. And… what can be done about it? Is there something I can take? Or… something else?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. Knowing what we're dealing with is the first step. There are several options for managing BPH, depending on the severity of your symptoms and the results of the tests. Mild cases can often be managed with lifestyle changes, such as reducing fluid intake before bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. There are also medications, called alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and reduce its size. In more severe cases, or if medications aren’t effective, procedures like transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, might be considered. We will discuss all these options in detail once we have the test results. I'll also have my nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or difficulty urinating, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A week… alright. No, I think… I think that covers it for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. And… making me feel a little less worried.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’ll work through this together. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab orders and schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
