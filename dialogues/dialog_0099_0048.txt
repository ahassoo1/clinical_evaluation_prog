DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…difficult to explain. My wife, she’s been telling me to come for a while now. I just…forget things. Not important things, usually. Just…names. And where I put things. It’s been happening more lately, though. Enough that she got worried.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Forgetting names and misplacing things… and it’s been increasing recently, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It's not like I'm losing my mind, Doctor. I still know how to do my work. Been setting tile for forty years, you know. Forty years! And I can still read the paper just fine. It’s just…small things. Like, I went to the market yesterday and completely forgot old Man Roth’s son’s name. I’ve known that boy since he was a little one!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand it's frustrating. It sounds like you're very aware of your abilities and rightly concerned about this change. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When did you first start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Probably…a couple of years ago, maybe? It started very slowly. A forgotten name here, misplacing my glasses there. Nothing major. But this past six months…it’s gotten a little more…frequent, shall we say? My wife keeps finding my tools in the refrigerator. The refrigerator, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Right. Six months of increasing frequency…tools in the refrigerator, that’s…unusual. Okay. And besides the names and objects, have you noticed any difficulty with other things?
PATIENT: Like what? What do you mean? I haven't been falling over or anything, if that's what you're asking. And I can still cook a proper Khmer meal, thank you very much. My wife says my fish amok is still the best in town. But…sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. You know? Like, I know what I want to say, but it just…doesn’t come out right.
DOCTOR: Difficulty finding the right words…that's helpful to know. So, it’s not necessarily forgetting what things are, but how to say them. Has this difficulty with words affected your daily conversations much?
PATIENT: It’s mostly with my wife. She’s very patient, bless her heart, but sometimes she has to guess what I'm trying to say. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I used to be able to tell a story like nobody's business! Now…now I stumble over things. And I get frustrated. Which makes it worse, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? Doctor, I'm 66 years old! My mood changes with the weather! But no, I don’t think so. I’m still…me. Maybe a little more irritable, because of this, but that's hardly a personality change. I’m a practical man. I don’t go around getting weepy over nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any history of head injuries, strokes, or any neurological problems?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. Worked construction my whole life, so I've bumped my head a few times, a minor thing. But never anything serious. No strokes, no nothing. My wife would know, she worries about every little ache and pain I have. She’d tell you if there was anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure. Been on medication for it for…oh, about ten years now, I think. Everything else is pretty good, considering. I eat pretty healthy, mostly Khmer food. Lots of fish and vegetables. I try to avoid too much sugar, though my wife makes a very good mango sticky rice…
DOCTOR: Right. And do you take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… just a vitamin D supplement. The doctor told me I wasn’t getting enough sun. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. Nothing else regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. Khmer food has all sorts of things in it, you know. Chilies, spices, herbs… never had a problem. My wife always teases me about my cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you had any surgical procedures in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… my appendix, when I was a young man. That was…oh, must be forty years ago now. And I had a small operation on my knee a few years back, for some arthritis. That's about it. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members have memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother... she was a little forgetful towards the end of her life, but we just put it down to old age. She lived to be ninety-three. And my uncle...he was confused a lot towards the end, but nobody ever really said what was wrong with him. We didn’t have doctors back then like we do now.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful to know. And finally, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm retired now, of course. Used to work very hard, setting tile, physical labor. Now I mostly putter around the house, help my wife with the gardening, that sort of thing. I drink a little bit of beer with dinner sometimes. Not a lot. And I try to stay active, walk around a little. Nothing too strenuous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright. Just some basic tests, checking your reflexes, balance, and a quick neurological assessment. It'll help me get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A physical examination? For a few forgotten names? Seems a little… excessive, Doctor. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just don’t expect me to do any jumping jacks.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason. It's a precaution, just to be thorough. No jumping jacks, I promise. If you could just sit on the table for me. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, a little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are good. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you stand up and try to balance on one foot for a few seconds?
PATIENT: There! See? Perfectly fine. Just a little unsteady on my feet. Old age, Doctor. It'll happen to you someday.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to test your memory and cognitive function. Just do your best. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Easy. You think I’m going to forget three words?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock, showing ten minutes after eleven. Just on this piece of paper. Don’t worry about making it perfect. I just want to see how you do.
PATIENT: There! Happy? I haven't drawn a clock in… well, I can’t remember the last time I drew a clock. It's not exactly something I do every day, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. Okay. And finally, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your orientation—your name, the current date, and where we are. Can you tell me your name?
PATIENT: My name? Are you serious, Doctor? Colt Lason. It's been the same name for 66 years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you know what is the date today, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: August… the second? Yes. August 2nd. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. And finally, do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: This is… Doctor Overgaard’s office. On Elm Street, I believe? In the city. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Lason. That concludes the examination. Based on the information you’ve provided, and the findings of this exam – including the slight balance impairment and difficulties with the clock drawing test and recalling the three words – I’m concerned about possible early signs of cognitive impairment. Now, I want to be clear, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have dementia or Alzheimer's disease. There are many things that can cause cognitive changes. However, it’s important to investigate further to determine the cause and appropriate course of action. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Blood tests? Doctor, I just came here because I forget where I put my glasses sometimes! You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. But I expect a clear explanation of everything. And I don’t want to be poked and prodded unnecessarily. I’m an old man, not a science experiment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. And I assure you, we’ll proceed cautiously and explain everything clearly. The blood tests are routine, and the neurologist will conduct a thorough evaluation to assess your cognitive function. Okay, I'm ordering a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a metabolic panel. I’ll also send a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in geriatric cognitive disorders. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend that your wife keep a log of any instances where you experience memory lapses or difficulties. This information can be helpful for Dr. Sharma during her evaluation. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A log? My wife already worries about everything! But…no, I don't think so. Just…please tell me how long all this will take. I don't want to be going back and forth to the doctor’s office for months. And what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: The blood tests should be completed within a week, and the results will be available shortly after. Dr. Sharma's appointment may take a few weeks to schedule, as she is a very busy specialist. As for your concern about it being serious, it's important to remember that early detection is key. If it is something like early-stage dementia, there are medications and therapies that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. We will work together to determine the best course of action based on the results of the tests and Dr. Sharma’s evaluation. I will give you a prescription for a B12 supplement in the meantime. It won't hurt and some people find it helpful. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… try not to scare my wife, alright? She’s already beside herself with worry. And don’t tell her everything at once. Baby steps, Doctor. Baby steps. Alright. I guess I'll go home and… try to remember where I parked the car.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. I will be mindful of your wife’s concerns. I'll contact her directly after Dr. Sharma’s appointment to discuss the results and next steps. Here’s the prescription, and this pamphlet has information about cognitive impairment and resources for support. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to contact my office. Take care, Mr. Lason, and try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Tools in the refrigerator… now a neurologist. What will it be next?
