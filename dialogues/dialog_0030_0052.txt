DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too, Dr. Quicksey. It’s good to meet ye as well. Well, it’s this morning sickness, really. Not the kind a woman gets, mind ye. I wake up most mornings feelin’ right queasy, like I’m gonna lose me breakfast. It’s been happenin’ for… oh, a good month now, I’d say. And the doctor said somethin’ about me heart, a while back… somethin’ wasn’t quite right. That’s why I’m here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, "morning sickness" that isn’t related to pregnancy, occurring for about a month. And you mentioned a previous concern with your heart – I see. Let’s start with the nausea. Could you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like that at all. It’s more… a rollin’ in the stomach, ye ken? Like bein’ seasick, but not as bad. It usually starts right after I wake up, before I’ve even had a bite to eat. Sometimes it lasts for an hour or so, sometimes it just comes and goes. And it doesn’t matter what I eat the night before, it seems. It just… happens. I’ve tried havin’ a wee biscuit before I get out of bed, but that doesn’t seem to make much difference. Though, I suppose it sometimes helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rolling nausea upon waking, lasting anywhere from minutes to an hour, and not consistently related to the previous night’s meals. A biscuit offers minimal relief. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it… I do get a wee bit breathless sometimes, especially if I’ve been walkin’ up a hill. And me ankles… they swell up a bit by the end of the day, mostly. I thought it was just old age, to be honest. But now that I’m thinkin’ about it, it happens pretty regularly. Not every day, mind ye, but most days. I also feel a bit tired, more than usual, but who doesn’t feel tired at me age?
DOCTOR: Breathlessness with exertion, ankle swelling, and increased fatigue. These are all potentially relevant, Mr. Benic. And it’s good you’re mentioning them. Now, let’s go back to this heart concern you mentioned. Do you recall what the doctor said specifically?
PATIENT: Aye, I do, though it was a good few years ago now. It was Dr. MacIntyre, a fine man. He said somethin’ about me heart not pumpin’ as strong as it should be, somethin’ about the chambers… they weren’t fillin’ right. He said I had somethin’ called… congestive heart failure, I think. He put me on some water tablets, and I took them for a while. But they made me need to be at the loo all the time, so I stopped takin’ them. I know, I know, I shouldn’t have, but I couldn’t live me life runnin’ back and forth! He warned me about salt and fluids, but… well, I’m a Scotsman. A wee bit o' salt is good for the soul, ye ken?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Benic. It sounds like you were diagnosed with congestive heart failure some time ago and were prescribed diuretics, which you discontinued due to side effects. And you’ve been mindful, to a degree, of dietary restrictions regarding salt. Now, have you noticed any changes in your symptoms since that diagnosis?
PATIENT: Aye, well, for a long time, I felt fine. Perfectly fine, not a bother in the world. But over the last year, I’ve noticed I’m gettin’ more tired, like I said. And the breathlessness is worse, even with just a gentle walk. The ankles swellin’ up is new, or at least worse than it used to be. And this mornin’ sickness… that’s completely new. I haven’t felt sick like this in… well, ever, really. It’s just all buildin’ up, ye ken? Like somethin’ is slowly goin’ wrong, and this mornin’ sickness is just the latest piece of the puzzle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic. It does sound like your symptoms are progressive and warrant a thorough evaluation. Before we proceed with a physical exam, could you please tell me about any allergies you have, and any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Aye, no allergies that I know of, thankfully. Never had a bother with hay fever or nothin’ like that. As for medications… well, nothin’ regular. I take a wee bit of cod liver oil now and then for me joints, but that’s it. And sometimes a paracetamol if I’ve got a headache, but that's rare enough. No prescriptions, no nothin’. I pride myself on keepin’ well, but it seems me luck is runnin’ out.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and no regular medications other than occasional cod liver oil and paracetamol. Thank you. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s grand, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve seen enough doctors in me time, so I’m not shy. Just try not to poke too hard, eh?
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Benic. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, Mr. Benic, I’m hearing a slightly rapid heart rate and some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. This could be consistent with fluid buildup. Your blood pressure is 150/90, which is elevated. And as you mentioned, there is some swelling in your ankles with pitting edema present. Now, let's check your weight. Your weight is 142 pounds. Do you know what your weight was a week ago?
PATIENT: Aye, I do, actually. I weighed meself last week, just after me grandson left. I was 138 pounds, give or take a wee bit. So I’ve gained four pounds in a week, which is… unusual for me. I usually keep a pretty steady weight. I’ve not been eatin’ any different, mind ye.
DOCTOR: That's a significant weight gain in a short period of time, Mr. Benic, and further supports my concern about fluid retention. Given your history of congestive heart failure, your current symptoms of nausea, breathlessness, and ankle swelling, and the findings on physical exam, I suspect your heart failure may be worsening. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function tests, and a BNP level. A BNP level is a marker that can help us assess the severity of your heart failure. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to evaluate your heart rhythm and look for any signs of cardiac ischemia. Finally, a chest X-ray would be helpful to assess for fluid buildup in your lungs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If ye think it’ll help, then go ahead. I trust yer judgement. I’d rather know what’s goin’ on than wander around feelin’ poorly. Are these tests somethin’ I can get done here, or do I need to go somewhere else? And… how much will all this cost? I’m not insured, ye see, so I need to be mindful o' me finances.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Mr. Benic. We can get all of those tests done here at the clinic. Let me explain the approximate costs. The blood tests will be around $150, the ECG is approximately $75, and the chest X-ray will be around $100. So, the total cost will be approximately $325. I know that’s a significant amount, and I’ll see if we can explore any options to reduce the cost, such as a payment plan. We also have some resources available to help connect you with financial assistance programs. I can provide you with information about those after the tests are completed. In the meantime, while we await the results, I recommend that you limit your fluid intake to 2 liters per day, reduce your salt intake as much as possible, and monitor your weight daily. If you experience any significant weight gain, worsening shortness of breath, or chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s… a lot o' money, but I suppose it's better to know what I’m dealin’ with. I can manage the fluid and salt, I’ll just need to be disciplined. And I’ll keep a close eye on me weight, that’s for sure. Two liters… that’s about eight glasses, is it? I can do that. And I’ll definitely come back if things get worse. Right, so we’ll get these tests done now, then? Do I need to do anything special beforehand? Fast for a bit, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll get the tests done now. You don’t need to fast for the blood tests. You can eat and drink as usual. The only thing is to avoid strenuous activity before the ECG, just to keep your heart rate stable. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood, and then we’ll get you set up for the ECG. It's a quick and painless procedure. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we’ll discuss a plan of action. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask. Let's get started. I’ll go ahead and get the nurse informed. She’ll be right in to take your blood.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds grand, Doctor. Thank ye for explainin’ everything so clearly. I appreciate it. Right then, let's get on with it. I’m ready when ye are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll just step out and let the nurse come in. She will explain the procedure to you in more detail.
