DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this itching. It’s just… everywhere, really. Been going on for a little while now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. Not a serious thing, I don’t think, but definitely annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand. Itching can be quite disruptive, even if it doesn’t feel like a serious condition. “A little while now” is fairly vague, so could you tell me approximately when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It probably started… oh, around the beginning of June, I’d say. Maybe the tenth? Give or take a few days. It wasn’t constant at first, just little spots here and there. But it’s gotten more… widespread since then. And more… insistent, if that makes sense. It's not like a bug bite itch, it's just… always there.
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things. So, starting around June 10th, and progressively worsening. And you describe it as not being like an insect bite – a constant itch rather than something intermittent. Now, has anything changed in your life around that time – new soaps, detergents, lotions, foods, travel, exposure to any new plants, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me see… New soaps… no, I haven’t changed my soap. Detergent, no. Lotion, no. Foods… I did start drinking more chamomile tea in June, actually. Just thought it might help me relax, you know? Lost my wife last year, still getting used to things… Travel? No. New plants… hmm. My neighbor gave me a little fern – a Boston fern, I think – around then. Beautiful thing, but I haven’t really touched it much, if that makes sense. Mostly just look at it. Could be something with that, maybe? I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, chamomile tea and a new Boston fern. We’ll certainly keep both of those in mind. Now, regarding the itching itself, where on your body is it most prominent?
PATIENT: Well, it's pretty much everywhere, like I said, but… I’d say my back and my chest are the worst. And my arms. My legs are a little better, thankfully. It's not bad on my face, just… noticeable, especially after I shower. It feels… rough, you know? Not bumpy, exactly, but not smooth either. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Back, chest, and arms being the most affected, with a rough sensation, especially after showering. Now, have you noticed any visible changes to your skin – redness, bumps, blisters, scaling, or anything else unusual besides the roughness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I looked in the mirror pretty closely yesterday, trying to figure it out. I don't see any blisters or anything like that. There is some redness, especially on my back, but it's not bright red, more… pinkish. And yeah, there's some scaling, especially on my arms. Small flakes, mostly. It’s not like… psoriasis scaling, more like… dry skin that’s flaking off. I keep putting lotion on it, but it doesn't seem to help much. It's… subtle, though. You might not even notice it if you weren't looking closely.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle pinkish redness and small scaling, particularly on your arms, and not significantly improved with lotion. Now, let's move on to a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for years now. Otherwise, pretty healthy, I think. I used to be a lot more active, but… well, things changed after my wife passed. I don’t get out much anymore. No diabetes, no kidney problems, no liver problems. Just… old age, I guess. Medicare covers everything, so I get checked out regularly, and they haven’t mentioned anything serious.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, and I appreciate you sharing that. Controlled high blood pressure is important to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just the blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And… sometimes I take a little something for sleep, but it's just an over-the-counter thing, like Melatonin. Nothing regular, just when I really can't sleep. And occasionally an antacid, if I eat something too spicy. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, occasional Melatonin for sleep, and antacids as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. She used to make all sorts of spicy dishes, and I could eat anything. No allergies to penicillin, no bee stings, no food allergies. Nothing. I can eat anything and take most medications without any problems. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had eczema when she was a child, but she outgrew it. My father… he had heart problems, that’s why he started eating healthy early on. And my wife’s mother had some sort of skin condition, I don’t remember exactly what, but it wasn’t contagious. Nothing major, really. No history of serious allergies or anything like that in either family, as far as I know. They weren’t big on talking about medical stuff, to be honest. Just sort of… tough it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of eczema in your mother, and a skin condition in your wife’s mother, but nothing major or specific. Now, just to round things out, could you briefly describe your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any hobbies that might be relevant?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife didn’t like it, so I just… never started. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but not much anymore. Not since… well, not since she passed. And hobbies… I used to enjoy gardening, mostly flowers. But it’s hard to keep up with things now. I mostly just sit around and read, or watch television. Nothing exciting. I go to church on Sundays. That's about it, really. Not much of a social life these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Ferneding. That gives me a much clearer picture. Alright. Based on everything you've told me, and reviewing your chart, I suspect this could be a case of contact dermatitis, possibly exacerbated by a mild allergic reaction, or just simple dry skin aggravated by the change in seasons. The chamomile tea and the Boston fern are both possibilities, but we’ll need to rule out other things. Now, would you mind if I take a look at your skin?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I’m just glad someone is finally looking into this. It’s been… unsettling, you know? Just the constant itching. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ferneding. I appreciate your trust. Alright. I'm noting some scattered areas of mild erythema, primarily on your arms and upper back, as you described. There is also some subtle scaling, consistent with dry skin. I don’t see any vesicles, pustules, or significant edema, which is reassuring. Palpation reveals no significant induration. There's a slight roughness to the skin, particularly on your forearms. Now, I'm going to gently scratch the skin on your forearm, just to see if there’s any immediate wheal and flare response, which would indicate a possible allergic reaction. It might feel a little… uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. A little discomfort is nothing, if it helps you figure out what's going on. I’ve had worse. Just let me know if you see anything. I trust your expertise. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting a very slight wheal and flare response after scratching, but it's not very pronounced. This suggests a possible mild sensitivity, but it’s not definitive. It could also simply be a response to the mechanical stimulation. Now, I’m going to take a look at your hands and feet, just to rule out any involvement there. Do you have any areas of itching or dryness on your palms or soles?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hands are okay, I guess. A little rough, like the rest of my skin, but no specific itching or dryness. And my feet are the same. A little dry, especially my heels, but nothing major. I put lotion on them every once in a while, but I forget sometimes. Just the usual old man stuff, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. The skin on your hands and feet appears unremarkable, with only mild dryness. Based on my examination and your history, I believe we're dealing with a case of irritant contact dermatitis, possibly with a mild component of allergic contact dermatitis. The new chamomile tea and the Boston fern are both potential irritants. It’s also possible it's simply a case of winter dryness exacerbated by the change in seasons. To rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a patch test to identify any specific allergens. I also recommend a skin scraping to rule out fungal infection, though it’s less likely based on my examination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Patch test and skin scraping… whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s been… distracting, to say the least. So yes, let’s do both. When can we schedule them? And will they be painful? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ferneding. We can schedule those for next week, likely on Tuesday afternoon. The patch test involves applying small amounts of various allergens to your back for 48 hours, then returning to have them removed and assessed. It’s generally not painful, but you might experience some mild itching or redness. The skin scraping is a quick, painless procedure where we gently scrape a small sample of skin from the affected area to examine under a microscope. While we wait for the results, I recommend using a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, and avoiding any potential irritants, such as harsh soaps or detergents. I’m also going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Tuesday afternoon is fine. And a cream to help with the itching… that sounds wonderful. Hypoallergenic moisturizer, avoid irritants… I can definitely do that. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It gives me a lot of peace of mind. What kind of moisturizer do you recommend specifically? And is there anything else I should be aware of while I’m waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. For the moisturizer, I recommend something containing ceramides and hyaluronic acid, such as CeraVe Moisturizing Cream or Vanicream Moisturizing Cream. Avoid any products containing fragrances, dyes, or alcohol. While you’re waiting for the results, it’s also important to avoid scratching, as that can worsen the inflammation and lead to infection. If you notice any signs of infection, such as pus, increased redness, or fever, please contact the office immediately. Here's a handout detailing contact dermatitis and how to manage it. I'm also writing you a prescription for Triamcinolone 0.1% cream – apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily for one week. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all makes perfect sense. Triamcinolone… I’ll be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Ceramides and hyaluronic acid, avoid scratching… I think I can manage that. Thank you so much for your time and attention. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could assist you. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’re here to help. We'll see you on Tuesday afternoon for the patch test. Have a good day, and try to relax.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris. You have a good day too. I feel much better already, just knowing what's going on.
