DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good afternoon to ye as well, Doctor. Well, it's this morning sickness, really. Bit of a strange thing for a man my age, eh? But it’s been happening for a few weeks now, mostly just when I wake up. Makes it hard to get goin' with the day, it does.
DOCTOR: Morning sickness… okay. And you said this has been going on for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Aye, about three weeks now, I'd say. Maybe a bit longer. It's not every morning, mind ye. Some mornings I'm fine as a fiddle. But most days, when I first sit up, there's a right queasy feelin'. Not vomit, usually. Just… unsettled. And a wee bit of… well, ye know.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettled. No vomiting, just nausea. And it’s worse when you first wake up. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse, besides just the time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Let me think a moment. No, not really. I've tried havin' a wee biscuit before gettin' up, but didn't seem to make much difference. Coffee makes it worse, definitely. I used to enjoy a strong cup with my breakfast, but now… not so much. It just feels… rougher.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it... I do get a wee bit breathless now and again. Not all the time, but when I'm walkin' up the hill to the library, I'm havin' to stop for a puff more often than I used to. And my ankles... they swell up a bit at the end of the day. I just thought it was the heat, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness with exertion and ankle swelling. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Aye, I think I've put on a wee bit. Not a lot, but my trousers are feelin' a bit tighter around the waist. I haven't weighed myself proper, mind ye. I just noticed the change in how things fit. I've been enjoyin' a bit of extra pudding lately, so that could be part of it. But the breathlessness is new, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. And just to be thorough, have you had any chest pain, dizziness, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And dizziness… not really. Maybe a wee bit light-headed if I stand up too quick, but that's just me gettin' old, I expect. As for… well, ye know, bowel habits… no, nothing much changed there. Regular as clockwork, thankfully. Though, now that I think about it, I have been feelin' more tired than usual. Just a sort of… draggin' feelin'. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles, and take your blood pressure. It'll just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy enough to be poked and prodded if it helps figure things out. I'll just… hop up here then, shall I? Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on your back, that's perfect. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just try to breathe normally. Okay… your heart sounds a little bit… muffled. And I can hear some crackling in your lungs when you take a deep breath. Your ankles do have some swelling, and a little bit of pitting edema when I press on them. Blood pressure is 150/90. Okay, Mr. Benic. Given your symptoms – the nausea, breathlessness, ankle swelling, weight gain, fatigue, and what I just heard – I'm concerned about possible heart failure. The crackling in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles, along with your elevated blood pressure, are all signs that your heart may not be pumping as efficiently as it should.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh… well now. That doesn't sound good at all, does it? I… I've not been feeling terribly ill, mind ye. Just a bit run down, as I said. And the nausea… I just thought it was something I ate. But crackling in the lungs… that does sound serious. What does that mean? What happens next? Will I need… will I need to be in the hospital?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic. It is concerning, but it doesn't automatically mean a hospital stay. We need to run some tests to confirm if it is heart failure, and if so, how severe it is. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity. Most importantly, I want an echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of your heart – to see how well your heart is pumping and to look at the valves. And a chest X-ray to assess the fluid in your lungs. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-sodium diet and a diuretic, a water pill, to help get rid of some of the fluid. This isn’t a definitive treatment, but it will help alleviate some of your symptoms while we wait for the test results. We’ll get this figured out, Mr. Benic. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in to draw blood for the tests. And we can schedule the echocardiogram for as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Aye… that’s a fair bit to take in, that is. A water pill… I suppose that makes sense. And the tests… well, if ye think they're necessary. Just… what causes heart failure? Is it something I did? And what's the prognosis? Will I be able to… will I be able to keep workin' at the library? That’s important to me, ye see. I like my books.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Benic. It’s good you’re asking them. Heart failure can be caused by a lot of different things. High blood pressure, like yours, is a common cause because it makes your heart work harder over time. Coronary artery disease – that’s when the arteries that supply blood to your heart get blocked – can also cause it. Sometimes, it's a valve problem or a previous heart attack. It's rarely something you did specifically, more often a combination of factors over many years. As for prognosis, that really depends on the severity of the heart failure and how well we can manage it. With medication, lifestyle changes – like a low-sodium diet and regular exercise, as appropriate – and close monitoring, many people with heart failure can live full and active lives. Regarding your work at the library… that’s something we can certainly discuss once we have the test results. We’ll need to see how well your heart is functioning and what limitations, if any, you might have. It's possible you may need to adjust your workload, but it’s too early to say definitively. Let’s focus on getting a diagnosis first, and then we can make a plan together. I'm going to have Sarah come in and draw your blood now, and we'll get the ball rolling on the echocardiogram. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Aye, no allergies, thankfully. Not to anythin' I know of, anyway. I've always been a sturdy sort, all told. I suppose I'm just… a bit surprised. Never thought I'd be worryin' about my heart. Right then. Let's get the blood drawn, shall we? And then this… echocardiogram. Sounds a bit frightenening, to be honest. What does it involve? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel a bit frightened, Mr. Benic. It does sound intimidating, but it’s a completely painless and non-invasive procedure. You'll lie on your left side on an examination table. A technician will apply a gel to your chest and then move a small device, called a transducer, over your skin. This device sends sound waves into your chest, and they bounce off your heart, creating images on a screen. It’s similar to getting an ultrasound during pregnancy. It doesn't involve any needles or radiation, and you won’t feel anything at all. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. My nurse, Sarah, will be in in just a moment to draw your blood. She’ll explain everything to you, and she’s very good at making people feel comfortable. After the blood draw, we’ll schedule your echocardiogram. And I’ll be right here to answer any questions you have along the way. We’re going to take this one step at a time, Mr. Benic. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll make a plan that’s right for you. Here comes Sarah now.
