DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, I need a letter. Just a quick one, if possible. It’s to confirm I’m able to fly. My travel agent needs it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter for fitness to fly. No problem, we can definitely look into that. To get started, can you tell me a little bit about why you need the letter?
PATIENT: It's... a bit complicated. My husband passed away a few months ago. We had a trip planned, a really long one, to Mongolia to visit family. I still want to go, for him, you know? The airline is asking for a letter just to be safe, since it’s a long flight and I’ve… been through a lot recently. They didn't specifically say why, just that it’s policy for these situations. It feels a little silly, honestly, but I want to make it happen.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. That must be incredibly difficult, and wanting to honor his memory by still taking the trip is very understandable. It doesn’t sound silly at all – airlines are just being cautious. Okay, so to write the letter, I just need to get a little bit of your medical history, just to be sure everything is okay for a long flight. Have you been feeling generally healthy lately?
PATIENT: Yes, generally. I mean, I’m still… processing everything, if that makes sense. But physically? Yes. No major issues. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, honestly. Just for check-ups. Nothing serious ever came up. I’m pretty healthy, I think. I walk a lot. And I eat… decently.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. “Decently” is a good start! It sounds like you take care of yourself. Okay, just to be thorough, have you had any new medical problems develop in the last few months – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been… really tired, sometimes. But I figured that was just… everything. Grief, you know? I’ve had a few headaches, but nothing I’d take medication for. Just regular tension headaches. I haven’t been sick, no fever, no coughing… nothing like that. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I'm probably not being very specific.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It’s good you’re recognizing the fatigue and headaches. Those can definitely be related to stress and grief. And it's perfectly okay if you're not being specific – I'll ask clarifying questions. Just to be sure – are these headaches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go. Mostly in the evenings, if I’ve been out a lot. Or if I’m trying to… focus on things. Like paperwork, or planning the trip. They’re not debilitating, just… annoying. I usually just lie down for a bit and they go away. Nothing a little rest doesn’t fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, mostly tension-type headaches, related to stress and activity. Have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: No, my vision is fine. I had my eyes checked last year, everything was normal. No blurriness, no spots, no… anything. I wear glasses for reading, but that hasn’t changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just a few more questions about your overall health. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – any awareness of your heartbeat being irregular?
PATIENT: No, none of that. My heart feels fine. I walk quite a bit, like I said, and I haven’t had any trouble keeping up. No chest pain, no dizziness… I feel pretty normal, honestly. Aside from the… sadness, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very reassuring. Now, have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy. My family... we don't really have a history of serious illness, thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. I really haven't spent much time at the doctor, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. Okay, so to recap: you're generally healthy, no major medical conditions, no significant family history, and you've been experiencing some fatigue and tension headaches related to grief and stress. You've had no chest pain, shortness of breath, or changes in vision. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… perfect. Exactly. You’ve got it all. Honestly, it’s good to hear it all written down like that. It makes it feel… real, I guess. Like I am okay. Aside from everything else, of course. But physically, yes. That's a very fair summary.
DOCTOR: That's good. And it sounds like you are physically okay for travel. I'm happy to write the letter for you confirming your fitness to fly. Before I do that, just one quick thing: do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. And that’s not regular, just when I really need it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No medications. Alright, I’m drafting a letter here stating that based on the information you’ve provided, you are medically cleared for air travel. I'll include a brief statement about the fatigue and headaches, noting that they appear to be stress-related and not contraindications to flying. Do you have any specific concerns you’d like me to mention in the letter, or anything else I should include?
PATIENT: No, I think that sounds perfect. Just… confirming I’m able to go would be wonderful. I don’t think anything else is needed. Thank you so much, Doctor. This is a huge weight off my shoulders.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Here you go. It’s signed and dated, with the clinic’s information. Just remember to listen to your body while you’re traveling. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. And allow yourself time to grieve and adjust. It’s okay to not be okay sometimes. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. This is… more than enough. Honestly, you’ve been wonderful. Thank you again, Doctor Ranjan. I really appreciate your time and kindness. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It was my pleasure. I hope you have a safe and meaningful trip. Please take care of yourself. Have a good day as well. And if you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.
PATIENT: .
