DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pirl. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a ton, but enough to worry me. Happened a couple times now, over the last few days. It’s… well, it’s blood, Doc. What do you think it is? I don’t usually bother with doctors unless it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz. Throwing up blood is certainly something we need to investigate. It’s good you came in. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean? It's red. Like… blood. Is that what you want to know? Bright red, dark red… sometimes there's… bits in it. I don’t pay a lot of attention, honestly. I just… clean it up and try not to think about it. Is it something I ate? Because I had some lamb the other night, real spicy… maybe that did it? Though I eat spicy all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if it's difficult to describe, Mr. Gentz. Knowing if it was bright red, dark, or more like coffee grounds can give us clues. And you're right to consider what you've eaten. “Coffee grounds” appearance, for example, suggests it may have been digested for a while. You mentioned bits in it… can you describe those bits?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t examine it that closely, okay? It’s… gross. Bits of… food, I guess? Like, partially digested stuff. Maybe. And… well, sometimes it looks like… tiny clots. Like little pieces of liver, if you want a comparison. I told you, I don’t usually deal with this sort of thing. I’m a practical man, I deal with… finished things, not what comes out of people. You understand? This is… delicate stuff. I just want to know what's wrong so I can get it fixed.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Gentz. It’s perfectly reasonable not to want to examine it closely. The color and presence of clots are helpful information, thank you. Now, besides the vomiting blood, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I’ve been feeling… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I’m always tired. Long hours, you know? Dealing with… things. And my stomach’s been a bit… unsettled. Not full-blown pain, just… queasy. And I’ve been… passing black, tarry stools. That started around the same time as the vomiting. Does that… mean anything? I don't know why I even bother coming to doctors, honestly. It’s always something.
DOCTOR: That does mean something, Mr. Gentz. The black, tarry stools, along with the vomiting blood and your feeling of tiredness and queasiness, are concerning. It suggests there may be bleeding in your upper digestive tract. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'm going to need to ask you a few more questions. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Honestly, I haven't been trying to lose weight. And I haven't been paying attention to the scale, if that's what you mean. I eat when I can, mostly. Working the crematory… it doesn’t leave a lot of time for meals. Probably haven't gained any, though. Definitely haven’t. I’m thin enough as it is, if you’ve noticed. People tell me I should eat more. What does eating have to do with throwing up blood? It just… happens. Is it stress? I’ve had a lot on my mind lately. My wife… it’s been two years now. Still gets to me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. Stress can certainly contribute to various health issues, and I'm very sorry for your loss. But given the symptoms you've described—the vomiting blood, black stools, tiredness—we need to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to need to examine you, and I would like to order some blood tests to assess your overall health and check for anemia. I also recommend a stool test to confirm the presence of blood. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… of course. Fine. Just get it over with. Blood tests, stool tests… whatever you need. Just tell me what's wrong. I don’t have a lot of time for this, Doc. Frankly, I'm not insured, so how much is all this going to cost? I’m already dealing with enough. And I'm a practical man, you know? I need to know what I’m looking at financially before we proceed. Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Gentz. We can discuss payment options after the tests are completed. We can also look into any assistance programs available. I want to assure you that we'll do our best to keep costs reasonable. For now, let's focus on getting a diagnosis. I'll start with a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. Afterwards, we’ll collect the samples for the tests. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. Just… be gentle. I’ve got a sensitive stomach already, and I don't need it poked and prodded any more than necessary. And Doc? No unnecessary questions, please. I’m not here to make small talk. Just tell me what’s wrong, what I need to do to fix it, and how much it's going to cost. That's all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I will be as thorough and efficient as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I will start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Just… get on with it. I haven't got all day. And try not to be surprised by anything. I'm a practical man, remember? I've seen things. Things you wouldn’t believe.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that… that’s a bit sensitive. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Feels… tight. Like something’s swollen. But it’s always been a bit like that, to be honest. I’ve had stomach trouble for years. Probably just nerves. Though, I guess if you press hard enough, anything will hurt, right? Don't go digging around too much, Doc. Just take my word for it, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz, but it's important for me to assess the situation thoroughly. The tenderness in your upper abdomen, combined with your other symptoms, warrants further investigation. I don't detect any obvious masses, but there is some discomfort upon palpation. Now, I would like to collect a stool sample and draw some blood for testing. Are you able to provide a stool sample now, or would you prefer to do that at home?
PATIENT: At home. Definitely at home. I’m not… inclined to provide samples in a clinical setting. Too… personal. I'll bring it with me next time I see you. Assuming there is a next time, that is. Just get the blood draw over with, Doc. The quicker I’m out of here, the better. And please… be quick about it. I don't have a strong constitution. I've seen things… it affects a man.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. We’ll collect the blood now. This will just take a few moments. Try to relax. Alright, we've completed the blood draw. Please keep that bandage on for at least fifteen minutes to prevent any bleeding. I’ve also given you instructions for the stool sample. Now, while we await the results, I would like to ask one more question. Do you consume alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Look, I’m not a lush, if that’s what you’re implying. I have a drink… maybe once or twice a week. Whiskey. Helps me… unwind. Though, it hasn't been much help lately. And it’s probably not the whiskey that’s got me feeling like this, if you want my honest opinion. It’s… other things. Things a doctor wouldn't understand. Just get the results, Doc. That’s all I care about. And if it’s something serious… well, just tell me straight. No beating around the bush. I'm a practical man. I can handle it. I have to handle it.
