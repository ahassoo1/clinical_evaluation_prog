DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever. Keeps coming back. It's been a pain, honestly. I’m Clide, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s good to meet you too, Clide. A recurring fever, you say. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts with just feeling kinda warm, you know? Not too bad. Then it gets higher, maybe 101, 102. Lasts a day or two, then goes away. But it always comes back. Happened three times now in the last month. I’m not a doctor, so I don’t know what it means, but it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Clide. Recurrent fevers are definitely something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what happens with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… with the fever? Let me think. I get tired, real tired. And achy, like I worked a double shift. No cough, no sniffles, nothing like a cold. Just… worn out and hot. Sometimes I get a bit of a headache, but not always. And I lose my appetite, definitely. Food just doesn’t taste good when I got the fever.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, body aches, occasional headache, and loss of appetite along with the fever. That’s helpful. Now, when the fever returns, does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly? No. That's the thing that's got me worried. It doesn't seem to be connected to anything. I haven't been traveling, haven't been around anyone sick as far as I know. It just… happens. I was gardening last week, but I garden every week. Didn't feel any different after that than usual.
DOCTOR: I see. No obvious triggers, which is good to know, but also makes it a little more challenging to pinpoint the cause. Let's go over some other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – things like a rash, any changes in your bowel habits, or any pain anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: No rash. Bowels are… regular. You know, nothing different there. And no pain, not really. Maybe a little stiffness in my back sometimes, but I'm a chiropractor, so that's normal. Always tinkering with something. It’s not with the fever, though. It's just… old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad to hear things are generally regular, and that your back stiffness isn't related to the fevers. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing serious. I haven’t really been to a doctor much in the last… well, decades, honestly. Just go to my patients, they come to me. I take care of them.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you’ve been generally healthy. And I understand you’re a chiropractor – that’s very helpful to know as well. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed any surgeries. Just the usual stuff - tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Everything else is… original equipment, you could say.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my back if it's acting up, but not regularly. That’s it. I try to stay away from too much medication if I can. What’s the point of being a chiropractor if you're just popping pills all the time, right?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair point, Clide. Alright, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife makes a great sofrito, and I’ve never had a reaction to that, and that’s saying something!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he had some trouble with his heart later in life. Nothing else that I can think of, really. My wife’s side of the family, they’re all pretty healthy too. Lots of Puerto Ricans live long lives, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Family history of hypertension and heart disease. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, take your temperature, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. Get it over with, let's see what's going on. I’ve been poked and prodded enough by my own patients, I can handle a little of it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is 100.4. Your pulse is 88 and regular, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don’t feel any enlarged organs. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling. Overall, the exam doesn’t reveal anything obvious. Your fever is present, but there’s no immediate indication of a specific infection. Now, given your recurrent fevers and the lack of a clear cause on exam, I would like to order some blood tests to help us figure out what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Okay, fine. Whatever it takes to get this sorted out. I’m just tired of feeling sick all the time. What kind of tests are we talking about? And will I need to come back multiple times? I got appointments to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide. We’ll try to make this as efficient as possible. I’m going to order a complete blood count to look at your white blood cell count and check for signs of infection. We’ll also do a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to look for inflammation in your body. We may also want to check for some common viral infections, depending on the results of these initial tests. These tests can be done with a simple blood draw here at the clinic. You'll likely need to come back in a few days to discuss the results, but we can schedule that appointment now to fit your schedule. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Fine. Let's get the blood draw done. And yeah, let's schedule the follow-up now. August 7th? I got a patient at 10, so anytime after that would work. I really need to get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: August 7th at 2:00 PM works perfectly. I'll have the lab technician draw your blood now, and they’ll send the results to me. In the meantime, continue to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If your fever spikes above 102, or if you develop any new symptoms like a severe headache, stiff neck, or rash, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… hoping this gets figured out quick. I hate being sick. Alright, let's get this blood draw done. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clide. I understand your frustration, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns at all.
