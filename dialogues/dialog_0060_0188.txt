DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Secondi, please have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi. Thank you. I… my pee is orange. Like, not normal yellow. Orange. It started maybe… three days ago? I don't know why.
DOCTOR: Orange, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not dark orange, not like… really bad. Just… a color that is not right. I drink water, you know? Normal amount. I don't feel sick, no pain, nothing. Just the color.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. And you said this started about three days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe four? It’s hard to remember exactly. I work a lot. It’s not… a big problem, just strange. I thought maybe it’s something I ate?
DOCTOR: Hm. Well, sometimes food can cause that, though usually it's more noticeable right after you eat it. Do you recall anything unusual you’ve eaten in the last few days?
PATIENT: Unusual… not really. I eat… normal things. Couscous, meat, vegetables. My wife cooks. I had… carrots yesterday, maybe? And some oranges, actually. Could that be it? I didn’t think about that.
DOCTOR: Well, it could be the oranges, though typically you'd see it immediately after consuming a large amount. Let's rule out other things first. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes… like what kind of changes? I… I go to the bathroom normal. Not… hard, not soft. Just… regular. I don't know if that answers your question. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular is good. Any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Nothing. It feels… normal when I pee. Just… the color is wrong. Like I said, it’s not hurting or anything. It’s just… worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you haven’t noticed any fatigue, nausea, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No. No tired. No sick feeling. And my stomach feels okay. No pain there. I work outside sometimes, in the sun. Maybe… dehydrated? But I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick examination, just to be sure. I’m going to check your hydration status and take a urine sample for testing. That’ll help us rule out a few things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… good. A test is okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is making my pee orange. It's… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll follow me. We'll start with a quick weight check and then I’ll need a urine sample. Just a standard cup, nothing fancy. Afterwards, I’ll listen to your abdomen and check your overall hydration. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Weight check… right. I hope it’s not something bad.
DOCTOR: Just step on, please. And try not to worry. A lot of things can cause a change in urine color, and most of them aren't serious. We just need to confirm everything is alright. 106 kilograms. Alright. Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I’ll get you a cup for the sample.
PATIENT: 106… is that bad? I work hard, I’m a big guy. But is that… too much? Sorry, I worry a little.
DOCTOR: Well, your weight is a little elevated, but we can discuss that later if needed. Right now, let's focus on your urine. If you could just provide a sample when you're ready. And try to collect at least a couple of ounces.
PATIENT: Okay. A couple of ounces. Right. A couple of ounces… I can do that. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Take your time.
PATIENT: Here you go. I hope that’s enough. It was… easy enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll see what this tells us. Okay… let’s see. Hmm. Your urine is slightly concentrated, and there's a trace of bilirubin. It's not a large amount, but it's enough to cause the color change.
PATIENT: Bilirubin? What is that? Is that bad? The color change is the only thing I’m worried about. Is it something I need medicine for?
DOCTOR: Bilirubin is a waste product created when your body breaks down red blood cells. A small amount is normal, but a higher level can indicate a problem with your liver or gallbladder. It’s not immediately alarming, but it does require further investigation. Considering your weight and the trace of bilirubin, I'd like to order a full liver function panel and a complete blood count to get a clearer picture. We should also run a test to rule out any underlying infections.
PATIENT: Okay. Tests… more tests. Liver… that sounds serious. Is it because of my weight? I eat… I try to eat healthy. My wife makes good food. Will I feel sick?
DOCTOR: It could be related to your weight, as obesity can contribute to fatty liver disease. But it's too early to say definitively. We need those test results first. And no, you likely won't feel sick. Many people with mild liver issues don't experience any symptoms. I'm going to give you a requisition form for the bloodwork. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… that’s a long time to wait. Okay. A requisition form. Any lab… I will go to the closest one. Will they… will they call me if something is really wrong? I worry a lot, you see. My wife will be worried too.
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you with the results, but realistically, it can take several days for them to come back. If anything is seriously abnormal, they'll call you immediately. Otherwise, you’ll receive the results online or by mail, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Honestly, Mr. Secondi, while I appreciate your concern, worrying excessively won’t solve anything. Let's get the tests done, and then we'll address whatever the results show. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think… no. Just the tests. Thank you. I will go to the lab. I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. You can find a list of local labs on the clinic website. And try to get the tests done as soon as possible. Have a good day, Mr. Secondi.
PATIENT: Thank you… .
