DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, you said? It's… nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… let me think. It’s my joints, mostly. They get real stiff in the mornings. It’s… bothersome. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it's been a while now, I think. Not a big deal, usually, but it makes getting going a bit harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in your joints, especially in the mornings. That sounds uncomfortable. Can you tell me which joints are bothering you the most?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s mostly my hands, I think. And my knees… yeah, definitely my knees. Sometimes my back too, but not always. It’s… hard to say exactly. They all sort of ache together, you know? Not sharp pain, just… stiff. Like they haven't been used in a long time, even when I have been. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, stiffness in your hands, knees, and sometimes your back. And it's more of an ache than a sharp pain. Has this stiffness been getting worse over time, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Oh… consistent, I think. Maybe a little worse on cold days? But I don't really… remember it getting suddenly much worse. It's just… always there a bit, you know? Especially when I wake up. It takes a bit to get moving. I don't know if that makes sense. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Lilliana. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember specific details. We’ll take things at your pace. So, consistent stiffness, worse on cold days. Do you notice any swelling or redness in those joints, especially your hands and knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit sometimes? But I honestly can’t say for sure. I haven’t really looked closely, you know? I just feel the stiffness. Redness… no, I haven’t noticed any redness. I try not to stare at my hands too much, if that makes sense. They aren't as pretty as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. No noticeable swelling or redness. Okay. And when you say it takes a bit to get moving in the mornings, about how long does that stiffness usually last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe half an hour? Sometimes longer if it’s really cold. I usually have a cup of tea and try to move around a bit, and that helps. But it doesn't go away completely, you know? It just… eases up a little. It’s not like I’m crippled or anything! It’s just… annoying. Do you need me to be more specific? I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing great, Lilliana. It’s helpful to know it eases with movement and tea. About half an hour of stiffness in the mornings that improves with activity. Do you experience any pain in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my shoulder aches a bit. But I think that's just from… reaching too much, you know? I help out with the little ones at the daycare. Lots of lifting. It's not a constant thing, though. And my feet… sometimes they hurt a bit at the end of the day. But that’s just from being on them all day. I don’t really consider that pain, just… tired. Does that make sense? I'm probably just old, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like you’re simply getting old, Lilliana. Shoulder discomfort with reaching, tired feet at the end of the day – those are good things to mention. Now, to get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that’s a hard one. It’s been a long time. I lost my husband, George, a few years back… and I haven’t really been to the doctor much since then. I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my wrist, but that healed up fine. And… I think I had the flu a couple of times? Honestly, Doctor, I don't remember much. I wasn't very good at keeping track of things even before my memory started to go. Is that helpful at all? I really apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilliana. Losing George must have been incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that your health wasn't a top priority then. A broken wrist in the past and occasional flu. That’s a good starting point. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don't think so. I haven’t taken any medication regularly in years. I used to get headaches sometimes, and I’d take… aspirin, I think? But I didn't have any reaction to it. And I don't remember ever being told I was allergic to anything. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But… to be safe, maybe you shouldn’t give me anything with… peanuts? I don’t like peanuts. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Lilliana. We definitely won't give you anything with peanuts. No known allergies, and a preference to avoid them. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can help it. I just have my tea, and try to move around. Sometimes a little bit of honey in my tea if my throat is sore. That’s it, really. I don't take any vitamins or anything fancy like that. Just… tea and movement.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has arthritis, or any other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. My mother, she had some problems with her hands when she got older. They were all gnarled and stiff, but I don't know if it was… arthritis, exactly. She didn't go to the doctor much either. And my father… he just had bad knees towards the end, but he was a very heavy man, so I always figured it was just from his weight. I don't really know much beyond that, to be honest. We weren't a very close family. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Lilliana. Your mother with hand stiffness and your father with knee problems. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, to get a better picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll just check your joints for swelling, tenderness, and range of motion. It shouldn’t take long at all. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t involve anything scary! I don’t mind you looking at my joints. It’s probably just old age, anyway. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just be gentle, please. My hands are a bit sensitive sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be very gentle. Let’s start with your hands. Can you open and close them for me, and then spread your fingers as wide as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There… like that. It’s a bit creaky, you know? And it feels a little… tight. It’s hard to explain. Just… not as smooth as it used to be. I try to do exercises, but it doesn’t really seem to help much. Is that what you’re looking at? The stiffness?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m looking at. And I can see a bit of bony prominence on the knuckles of both hands. There is some tenderness when I press here. Now, let’s move on to your knees. Can you bend them as far as comfortable for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a bit uncomfortable. They don’t bend as far as they used to. There’s a little bit of a… grating feeling, you know? Like rubbing bone on bone. It’s worse when I’ve been sitting for a while. And… …there's a little bit of a pain when I bend them too far. Not sharp, just… achey. Does that make sense? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all, Lilliana. It’s important for me to understand what you’re experiencing. I also feel some mild tenderness along the joint line. Your range of motion is limited in both knees. And I notice a slight… stiffness in your gait. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have osteoarthritis in your hands and knees. It’s a common condition, especially with age, and it causes the cartilage in your joints to break down over time.
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis. That sounds… serious. Is that… bad? I mean, is there anything I can do about it? I don’t want to end up crippled or anything. My George… he had a bad back towards the end. I don’t want to end up like him. I just want to be able to… keep going, you know? Taking care of the little ones… I love my job. Is there anything… anything at all… that can help?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Lilliana. Osteoarthritis is a chronic condition, but it's rarely debilitating. And many things can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. It won't necessarily lead to being "crippled," as you put it. We can explore a number of options. We can start with some simple lifestyle changes, such as regular, low-impact exercise like walking or swimming to strengthen the muscles around your joints. Weight management can also help reduce the stress on your knees. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage the pain, but we’ll need to discuss those carefully given your health history. We can also talk about physical therapy to help improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles. We can also consider injections, like cortisone or hyaluronic acid, to help lubricate the joints and reduce pain. But we’ll start with the more conservative options first. Would you be open to trying those?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… good. Simple things first. I can definitely try walking more. And I’ll try to lose a little bit of weight. I do love my sweets, though. But I can cut back. And… I don’t know about physical therapy. I’m not very good with exercises, you know? But I’m willing to try. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much. And… the pills. Are they safe? I don’t want to end up with side effects. Just… help me keep going, Doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilliana. We’ll work together to find a plan that works for you. We'll start slowly and focus on making small, sustainable changes. We can begin with a referral to a physical therapist who can create a customized exercise program for you. They will teach you proper form and ensure you don't overexert yourself. As for the pills, acetaminophen is generally well-tolerated, but we'll start with the lowest effective dose and monitor you for any side effects. I’ll give you a handout with information on osteoarthritis and some tips for managing your symptoms. I'm going to write a prescription for acetaminophen 500mg, take two tablets every 6-8 hours as needed for pain, but no more than 8 tablets in a 24-hour period. And I’ll send a referral to Sarah Miller, a physical therapist here in town. She’s excellent. I’d like to see you back in a month to see how you’re doing and adjust the plan as needed. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, or any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… perfect. A month. I can do a month. And Sarah Miller, you said? I’ll remember that name. And the pills… I’ll be careful. I don’t want to take too many. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… really put my mind at ease. I was so worried, but now I feel… hopeful. I just want to keep taking care of the little ones. That’s all that matters. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll see you next month. And I’ll call if anything… anything at all… changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small steps can make a big difference. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you next month. Take care, and enjoy your time with the little ones.
