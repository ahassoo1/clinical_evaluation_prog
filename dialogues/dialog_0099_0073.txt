DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s… embarrassing. I’ve been having a really bad time with… well, you know. Diarrhea. It just won’t stop. And I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested. It’s been going on for… too long. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: “Embarrassing” is a rather subjective term, Ms. Woodring. The human body… functions. And sometimes those functions misbehave. It’s my job to sort it out. “Everything the pharmacy suggested,” you say?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes, everything. Those little pink pills… Imodium, I think? And something else, a chalky one. They did absolutely nothing. Honestly, the pharmacist just seemed to want to get me out of there. I’m not one to bother doctors unless it’s really… pressing. And this is beyond pressing. It's interfering with… things. You don’t need the details.
DOCTOR: Right. Imodium… loperamide. And bismuth subsalicylate, likely – Pepto-Bismol. So, over-the-counter anti-diarrheals haven’t touched it. And you’ve been taking them… how long have you been trying these medications, and at what dosage?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t remember the exact dosage. A few pills at a time, when it got bad. A couple of days, maybe? Honestly, after the first day, I just kept taking them hoping something would work. I’m not a doctor, I don’t measure everything! It’s been… a week, at least, of this whole mess. And it’s not getting better, it's just… constant. Really constant. Are you going to help me or just quiz me?
DOCTOR: I am attempting to help you, Ms. Woodring, but I need accurate information to do so. "A few pills" is not a dosage. And “constant” still isn't terribly helpful. Is it watery?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes, it’s watery! What did you expect? It's not… chunky, if that's what you're asking. It’s just… a lot of water, several times a day. And it’s… unpleasant. Really unpleasant. I’ve barely left the house. I’m a painter, you know, and you can’t exactly be running to the bathroom constantly when you're trying to finish a job. This is costing me money! Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re eventually getting somewhere. The frequency is still relevant. How many times a day are we talking?
PATIENT: Honestly? Too many. I’ve stopped counting. At least… six, maybe eight times? It's awful in the morning, then it calms down a little… but then it starts up again. I don't even want to drink water because I know what will happen. It’s just… exhausting. And embarrassing. Again. I really need this sorted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick listen and feel. Just relax. Tell me if anything feels tender. Any pain anywhere in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is… unpleasant. Yes, it’s tender, all over, really. Especially… down there, on the left side. It’s just… general discomfort, but it’s worse on that side. It feels… bloated too. Like I’m going to explode. Can we please just get to the bottom of this? I don’t enjoy being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness throughout, with particular discomfort in the left lower quadrant, and reports of bloating. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No! No blood. Definitely no blood. That would be… awful. It’s just… water. And the discomfort. It’s not like I'm enjoying detailing this to you, you know. This is a really unpleasant conversation. I’m a painter, not a medical textbook. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand you find this discussion… unpleasant. However, a thorough history is essential for an accurate assessment. Now, have you experienced any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes, a little bit of nausea. Not vomiting, thankfully. And I felt a bit warm yesterday, but I didn’t bother taking my temperature. I figured it was just… stress. Honestly, I've been stressed about this whole mess. And my job. And everything. A little warm, a little nauseous, and constantly running to the bathroom. Is that helpful? Can we please talk about fixing it now?
DOCTOR: Minimally. Alright. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No! Where would I have time to travel? I’m trying to finish a mural downtown. I haven’t left the city in months. Honestly, are you even listening to me? I’m a painter. I work. I don’t jet off to exotic locations. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I am listening, Ms. Woodring. I simply need to rule out all possibilities. Now, any recent changes to your diet?
PATIENT: Ugh, no! I eat the same things, always. Coffee, toast, sometimes a sandwich. Nothing fancy. I haven't suddenly started eating questionable street food or anything. Honestly, I'm starting to feel insulted. You're acting like I asked for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms, lack of travel, and stable diet… it’s likely a viral gastroenteritis. Though given the duration, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a stool sample to check for parasites and bacteria. It’s unpleasant, but necessary. We will also run a basic metabolic panel to check for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Just what I needed. Fine. Whatever. Just tell me what I need to do, and let's get this over with. I have a job to finish. And I’m not thrilled about spending my day… providing samples. Where do I even go for this?
DOCTOR: The lab is two blocks down, on Elm Street. They’ll provide you with the necessary container and instructions. It's best to collect a sample first thing tomorrow morning, if possible. The requisition has all the details. Avoid eating anything for a few hours beforehand, as per the instructions. Now, I'm prescribing an anti-diarrheal – a different one than you’ve tried – and an oral rehydration solution. It’s essential to stay hydrated. This should help alleviate the symptoms while we await the lab results. I also suggest a bland diet – toast, rice, bananas. If your symptoms worsen – high fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stool, signs of dehydration – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Okay. Toast, rice, bananas. No travel, no fancy food, and… more pills. I understand. Emergency room if it gets worse. Elm Street for the… sample. Look, I'm not thrilled about any of this, but I'll do it. Can I go now? I really need to get back to work. And honestly, I'm starting to feel even worse just talking about it. Is there anything else?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Woodring. That will be all. Please call the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms don't improve within a couple of days. And try to rest. Good day. .
