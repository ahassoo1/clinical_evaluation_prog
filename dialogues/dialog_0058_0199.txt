DOCTOR: Right, Marquie Chayer. Thirty-two years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that’s me. Look, to be honest, I’ve been… short of breath. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been getting worse. It’s hard to explain, sorry.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, “short of breath”... and it’s been gradually worsening. That's helpful, even if the exact timing is fuzzy. Can you tell me a little more about how it's worse?
PATIENT: Like… I get tired just walking up the stairs. Or, you know, doing normal stuff around the house. It feels like I can’t get enough air, sometimes. Not like I’m choking, exactly… just… winded, really easily. My wife keeps telling me I need to come in, she’s worried too. I work… well, I work with water stuff, at the plant. It's kinda physical sometimes, and it's getting harder to do. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, so exertion makes it worse – stairs, housework, work… and it’s impacting your ability to do those things. “Not choking, just winded easily.” Alright. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable. Other days… like today, it feels like I’m breathing through a straw. It’s weird. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it's… unsettling. I don't know if that helps? It's hard to keep track, honestly. Everything feels a bit blurry when I try to remember details.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent shortness of breath, worse on exertion, and you've noticed it’s more pronounced on some days than others. That’s useful. Have you had any chest pain with this, or any cough?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. And no cough. Just… the breathing thing. Sometimes I feel a little… wheezy, maybe? But not always. It’s just… hard to describe. I’m not a doctor, you know? I just know I can’t do as much as I used to. Sorry if I’m not being very helpful. I just… don’t remember things very well. Is it bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Marquie, you’re doing fine. It’s good you're describing what you feel, even if it’s hard to put into words. The wheezing is a good detail. And no, you aren’t being unhelpful at all. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history to see if anything might be contributing. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I’ve been pretty healthy, mostly. I had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing serious. I haven't really been to the doctor much, to be honest. Especially not for breathing problems. My wife… she's the one who usually keeps track of all that stuff. I really don’t know if I've had any of those things. Sorry. Does that mean something?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses of lung problems. Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries. Never had anything like that. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work, nothing major. I really haven't had much luck with remembering stuff like this, I'm sorry. It's frustrating for me too.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Okay. What about your family – do any of your parents or siblings have asthma, COPD, or any other breathing issues?
PATIENT: My… my mom, she had some breathing problems when she got older. I think it was… emphysema, maybe? But she lived back in Venezuela, and I wasn't around much when she got sick. My dad was always healthy as a horse. And I don't really know much about my siblings' health, we haven't seen each other in years. Does that help? It’s all a bit… distant. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of emphysema in your mother. That’s potentially relevant. Now, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing at all. And… allergies? Not that I know of. I get the occasional sniffle, but nothing serious. No reactions to anything, not that I’ve noticed. I really don’t take anything regularly. I’m pretty simple, I guess. Still feeling a little nervous about all this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. It shouldn't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind. I have to get back to work later. And… try not to poke too much? I'm not a big fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Of course. No needles today, I promise. Just listening and a quick look. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… Okay. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, bilaterally. That means both sides. Nothing alarming, but it explains some of the shortness of breath. Your heart sounds normal. Overall, you appear in good general health, aside from the wheezing.
PATIENT: Wheezing, huh? Is that bad? My wife always says I should have gone to the doctor sooner. She worries a lot. What does that mean? What’s going to happen now? I have to get back to work, you know? We’re kinda short-staffed. I don’t want to lose my job over this.
DOCTOR: It's good your wife encouraged you to come in. The wheezing suggests some airway narrowing, which can be caused by a few things. It’s not immediately alarming, but we need to figure out what’s causing it. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a simple blood test – a complete blood count – to rule out any infection. The X-ray will show us if there's anything going on in your lungs, like pneumonia or fluid buildup. The blood test will check for signs of infection and assess your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and blood work… Look, I'm not a fan of hospitals, and honestly, I don’t have insurance. I can barely afford rent, you know? Is it… really necessary? Can’t we just… give me something for the breathing? I just need to get back to work. I don't want to get into debt over this. Is there… a cheaper option?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Marquie. It’s good you brought up the insurance issue. I wish there was a simple answer, but it’s important to be thorough, especially since we haven't pinpointed the cause of your breathing problems yet. The X-ray and blood tests are relatively inexpensive – I can check the clinic’s pricing for you, and we can see if there are any financial assistance programs available. Without them, it’s difficult to say what’s causing your wheezing, and I wouldn’t want to prescribe anything without knowing the underlying cause. It could be something minor, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities. We could try a trial of a bronchodilator inhaler – something to open up your airways – but I’d feel much more comfortable doing that after we’ve had the results of the X-ray and blood test. It's a small precaution, but it could prevent complications later. Do you think we could proceed with the tests, and I’ll do my best to minimize the cost?
PATIENT: Ugh… alright. Fine. But you gotta promise me you'll keep the cost down. And… try to be quick, okay? I really need to get back to work. And… could I maybe get a note for my boss? Just explaining that I was at the doctor? She's kinda strict. I don't want to lose my job over this. This is all so stressful. I just wanted something to help me breathe. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand, Marquie. You’re not asking too much at all, and I promise to do everything I can to keep the costs down and make this as quick and easy as possible. I'll write a detailed note for your boss explaining your visit and recommending any necessary time off. Let's get the paperwork started for the X-ray and blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician will explain the procedure to you. It won’t take long. And then we can discuss the results as soon as they’re available. While you're getting those tests done, I'll also look into any local resources that might help with the cost of care. We’ll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Okay… fine. Just… let me know when I need to go. And… please, don’t make me wait too long. I really need to get back to work. I hate hospitals. This is all just… a lot. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Marquie. I’ve just sent the orders to the lab and the radiology department. A nurse will come and get you shortly to take your blood and direct you to the X-ray room. It shouldn't be a long wait. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and let you know what we find.
