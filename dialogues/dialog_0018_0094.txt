DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. I think... my husband said I should come. Something about... learning? He worries too much. I work with metal, you know. It’s…hard work. Not much time for…this.
DOCTOR: I see. It's very common for husbands to encourage us to prioritize our health, even when we’re busy. And working with metal is demanding physical labor. So, let’s try to make this as efficient as possible. When you say "learning," are you referring to a specific symptom or concern that’s been bothering you, or is it more a general check-up your husband suggested?
PATIENT: Symptom? What’s a symptom? He just said… be careful with the dust. And… my hands. They ache, sometimes. But I work with metal! Aches are normal, right? I don't know what he told you. He always exaggerates. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: A symptom is simply a feeling or physical change that indicates something might be going on in your body. It sounds like the dust your husband mentioned is a concern, and you’ve also noticed some aches in your hands. That's helpful information. While aches can be normal with physical work, it’s good to investigate further just to be sure. Let’s start with the dust. Could you tell me more about the type of metal you work with, and what kind of precautions, if any, you take when working with it?
PATIENT: Precautions? Uh… I wear gloves. Sometimes. When I remember. It’s mostly steel, I think. Different kinds. Shiny steel, dull steel… heavy stuff. We cut it, bend it, build things. It gets dusty, yeah. Always dusty. We have fans, I guess. It's just… work. I don’t really think about the dust. It’s always been like that. Is this important? My husband always makes a big deal out of little things.
DOCTOR: It's good you're wearing gloves when you remember – that's a helpful start. And the fans are good as well. It is important, Ms. Fontanazza, because prolonged exposure to metal dust can sometimes lead to health concerns, even if it's been like this for a while. We want to make sure everything is alright. Now, you mentioned aches in your hands. Can you describe those aches for me?
PATIENT: Ugh. They're…dull. Like a heavy feeling. Mostly in my knuckles, and sometimes my wrists. Especially after a long day. Like…when I'm tightening bolts. Or cutting sheet metal. It’s hard to explain. They don’t hurt hurt, just…tired. And stiff. I just rub them. And take a break. Is it really that bad? It’s just… work. I've been doing this for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, "dull aches" in your knuckles and wrists, worse after work, particularly with tightening bolts or cutting metal. They feel tired and stiff, and you relieve them with rest and rubbing. That’s a very helpful description, thank you. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms, perhaps any difficulty breathing, coughing, or skin irritation?
PATIENT: Skin irritation? No, not really. My hands are always rough, from the metal, but that’s normal, right? Coughing… sometimes. But I smoke, a little. So that’s probably it. Difficulty breathing… not that I notice. I get…winded sometimes, after climbing the stairs. But I’m not…in shape. It’s just…everything is tiring. Honestly, I don’t really pay attention to things like that. Is this going to take long? I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Ms. Fontanazza, and I'll do my best to be efficient. The coughing is good to know, and it's helpful that you mentioned the smoking. And it's understandable that you get winded after climbing the stairs, especially with your level of physical activity. Just to be thorough, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, asthma, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Arthritis? No. Asthma… I don’t think so. My husband gets that sometimes. Lung problems… I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Probably years. I just… try to ignore things. I had the flu once, maybe. A really bad cold. That's about it. He always wants me to go to the doctor, but I just... don't see the point. Everything hurts when you work with metal, right? It’s just… part of the job.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been very resilient and have managed well on your own. No previous diagnoses of arthritis or asthma, and haven’t seen a doctor in several years. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… just pain relievers. When my hands are really bad. Ibuprofen, I think. The blue kind. And… sometimes I take something for my sinuses. When they get blocked. That's about it. I don't really like taking pills. My husband tries to give me vitamins, but I forget to take them. Everything makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for hand pain and something for your sinuses. Thank you. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – have any medical conditions, such as arthritis, lung disease, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… My mother… she had something with her lungs, I think. She coughed a lot. She smoked, too. A lot. She… passed away when I was young. My father… he was healthy, I think. Just… old. He had a bad heart, maybe? I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago. We weren't close. Does it matter? Everything feels so long ago.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if details are fuzzy, Ms. Fontanazza. Knowing your mother had lung problems and your father possibly had heart issues is helpful information. Thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. A lot. I come home, I eat dinner, I sleep. Sometimes I watch television with my husband. I don't really have… hobbies. I used to like gardening, but I don't have time anymore. I don't exercise. Is that what you mean? It's all just… work. I'm always tired.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, thank you. It sounds like work is a very central part of your life, and you're very dedicated. Before I proceed with a physical examination, I want to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. I don't really pay attention to things like that. Maybe… sometimes I get a little itchy when I touch certain plants in the garden. But that's just… plants. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything. My husband is allergic to cats, but that's not me. Is this really important? I have to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: It's good to know you don’t have any known allergies. It helps us ensure your safety. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on with your hands and overall health, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination. This will involve listening to your lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your hands and wrists. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick. I have things to do. I don't like being poked and prodded. I just want to know if everything is okay so I can get back to work. I really don't have time for this. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fontanazza. I’ll be as efficient as possible. I will start by listening to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. And I’m hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds, which could be related to your smoking history and potential past lung issues. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Could you please extend your arms and palms up?
PATIENT: See? Just work hands. I told you. It’s normal. Hard work. And I ache sometimes. Don’t make a big deal out of it. I need these hands for work.
DOCTOR: I see the calluses and roughness consistent with manual labor. There’s some mild tenderness when I palpate the knuckles on both hands, and a slight limitation in your range of motion. I also notice some mild swelling in the joints of your hands. Your grip strength is slightly reduced. These findings suggest some possible inflammation in your hands, which could be contributing to the aches, stiffness, and reduced grip strength. While it’s certainly possible this is simply due to the demands of your work, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. We also need to do an X-ray of your hands to look for any structural changes. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Blood tests? X-rays? Now you're just trying to make a big deal out of nothing! I told you, it's just work! I don’t have time for tests and…and pictures. I need to be at work. My husband is going to be furious if I take too long. I don’t want pictures or tests. Just tell me if I can go back to work or not! This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza, and I apologize if this is causing you stress. I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't believe they were important for your health. While it is possible this is simply due to work, these tests will help us rule out more serious conditions and ensure we're not missing anything. However, I respect your autonomy and will not order any tests without your consent. Given your reluctance, we can proceed with a conservative approach. I recommend you rest your hands as much as possible, apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes several times a day, and take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, as needed. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, I strongly advise you to return for further evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Rest, ice, pills. Just what I needed. More time off work. But… alright. If that's all, then yes. Just rest, ice, and pills. And don’t make me come back unless it gets really bad. I have things to do. Now, can I go? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I'll write you a prescription for a refill of ibuprofen and provide you with instructions on hand care and pain management. Please remember, if your symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you feel better soon. .
