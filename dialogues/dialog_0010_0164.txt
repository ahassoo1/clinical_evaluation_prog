DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow-looking, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Haggar. That is something to look into. Tiredness and yellowing of the skin – that yellowing is called jaundice, by the way – and a connection to fava beans… that's quite specific. Let me pull up your record here… Alright, Mande Haggar, age 51. And you mentioned this happens after eating fava beans, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not every time I eat them, but most of the times, yes. And it's not just a little tired, Doctor. Like, I can barely get through the day sometimes. It feels… draining. Do you think it is the beans? It sounds so silly saying it out loud.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Haggar. We have to consider all possibilities, and your observation is very important. What you’re describing could potentially be related to a condition called Favism – a genetic deficiency that causes a reaction to fava beans. To get a clearer picture, let's go through some questions. First, has this tiredness been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It’s been… gradual, I think. It didn’t just hit me one day. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, maybe six months or so. At first, I just thought I was getting older, you know? But then I started noticing the yellowing after the beans, and it really started to worry me. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Haggar. A gradual onset makes it more important to investigate thoroughly. And noticing the correlation with the fava beans is definitely a key piece of information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been feeling a bit breathless sometimes, just with normal activity, like walking up the stairs. And my stomach… it’s been a little upset, now that you mention it. Not constantly, but I’ve had some cramping and… well, just a general feeling of being unwell in the stomach area. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Breathlessness and stomach upset – those can definitely be related. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with anemia before?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I’ve had the usual check-ups with my family doctor over the years, but nothing specific like that. I’ve never been told I was anemic. I get a little tired easily, but I always figured that was just part of getting older, or working too hard. Is anemia something… serious?
DOCTOR: Anemia simply means you have a lower than normal amount of red blood cells. It can be serious, depending on the cause and severity, but it's often treatable. Given your symptoms and the connection to fava beans, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood tests. The blood tests will help us determine if you have anemia, and if so, what type. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I want to know what's going on, so whatever you think is best. A physical exam and blood tests… yes, please. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at your skin tone. Then we’ll get the bloodwork ordered. Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Haggar… and exhale. Good. Now another deep breath… and exhale. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt… just a little uncomfortable, maybe. But not pain, no. It feels… tender, I suppose. Especially on this side. It’s not a sharp pain, just… sensitive. It's been like that for a little while, even when I'm not eating beans.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. And your skin does appear slightly jaundiced, as you mentioned. Not severe, but noticeable. Alright, Ms. Haggar. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, I’m suspecting either Favism or another cause of hemolytic anemia. The blood tests will be crucial in determining the exact cause. I'll order a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme assay. The G6PD assay is specific for detecting a G6PD deficiency, which is the cause of Favism. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies to any medications that I know of. I haven't taken anything regularly in years, except for occasional pain relievers for headaches, and I’ve never had a reaction to those. No, I don't think so. Just the occasional headache, and nothing special for those.
DOCTOR: Good. Okay, I’m ordering the bloodwork now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll need a small sample of your blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any other foods that might trigger your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Avoiding the beans makes sense, of course. A few days to get the results… that sounds reasonable. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s been worrying me for a while, and I feel much better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I’m glad I could help. It’s always best to investigate these things, and I'm hopeful we'll have some answers soon. The lab technician will be expecting you. Just tell them you're here for Dr. Annesley's order. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I'll see you in a few days to discuss the results. Do you have any transportation concerns or need assistance with arranging a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I have a ride, and I can easily arrange another appointment. I appreciate you asking, though. I think I'm all set. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll see you then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
