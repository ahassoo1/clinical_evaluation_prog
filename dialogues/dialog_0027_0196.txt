DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness, you see? It just… doesn’t go away. It's been going on for… a long time now, I think. Honestly, dates are a bit fuzzy these days. But a long time. It's just… draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-lasting tiredness. That sounds frustrating. And you said dates are a bit fuzzy... roughly, can you recall when you first started noticing this exhaustion?
PATIENT: Ugh, frustrating is… a good word for it. Let me think… Before my husband… after he… passed. Yes, definitely after. It was… sometime in the fall, maybe? Or winter? Honestly, everything feels mixed up. It wasn’t right after, but… not long after, I suppose. A few months, maybe? It’s hard to say, truly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss can certainly make it difficult to keep track of time, and it's completely alright that the dates aren't precise. A few months after your husband's passing… okay. And has this tiredness been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly constant, yes. Some days are… worse than others, naturally. But it’s always there, you know? Like a weight. It doesn’t really go away, it just… shifts. I have good days where I can manage, but even then, I feel… depleted. It's not like I can really do much even on the good days.
DOCTOR: Constant tiredness, with fluctuations in severity… Alright. And when you say depleted, can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not just sleepy, you see? It's… like all my energy has been… siphoned off. Like someone took a battery and just… drained it. I have trouble concentrating. Things feel… distant. And my muscles… they ache, even when I haven’t done anything. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a constant weariness.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds… significant. Muscle aches alongside the exhaustion and difficulty concentrating. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I’ve been… a bit more forgetful lately, I guess. Not like… losing keys, just… names. Faces. Little things. And… sometimes I get a bit dizzy when I stand up too quickly. Nothing major, but enough to make me pause. And… I've just felt… colder than usual, even when it’s warm. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, dizziness upon standing, and feeling colder than usual… Yes, that’s helpful. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I could barely eat a thing, other days I’m… trying to eat, but it doesn’t really… satisfy me, you know? And yes, I think I’ve lost a little weight. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t really… weighed myself. Not recently, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder control?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… well, that’s a bit… personal, isn’t it? Let me see… No, nothing… drastic. Everything’s been… regular, I suppose. No changes there, thankfully. I'm not sure what you need to know, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and that’s perfectly alright. I just ask to rule out certain possibilities. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I had… high blood pressure, for a while. But it was… under control, with medication. The doctor took me off it a few years ago. And… arthritis, in my hands. It flares up sometimes, but nothing too bad. Other than that… I don’t think so. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but… nothing major.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, previously treated, and arthritis in the hands. And are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all right now. I try to manage the arthritis with… creams, you know? And heat packs. I don’t like taking pills unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. No allergies, thankfully. I think I would remember if I did!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart problems, towards the end. And my sister… she had something with her nerves, but I don't remember the name of it. It's all a bit fuzzy, you see? I wasn't very close to her.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and a nerve condition in your sister. Okay. And just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s about it. I don't really care for it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or regular alcohol consumption. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. But please, don’t take too long. I have… a few things I need to get to later.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are slightly diminished. And finally, I'm going to palpate your thyroid gland… Your thyroid feels normal, no swelling. Okay, all done.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Elevated blood pressure… that doesn’t sound good. What does it mean, Doctor? And what now? I really need to get going soon, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily alarming, but it’s something we should investigate further. Elevated blood pressure, along with your fatigue, diminished reflexes, and feeling colder than usual, points towards a few possibilities. It could be related to your thyroid, even though it feels normal, or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, complete blood count, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us rule out several potential causes and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests. Of course. More tests. I was hoping to avoid that. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. How long will it take, and what do I need to do? And will I have to come back again?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It's never ideal, but it’s the best way to get to the bottom of this. The blood tests should take just a few minutes, and the lab is right down the hall. You don’t need to do anything special – just try not to eat or drink anything besides water for about eight hours beforehand. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes about three to five business days to get the results back. And depending on what they show, we might need to do further testing or start a treatment plan. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Three to five days. I suppose that’s not too bad. No eating… I can manage that. And then another appointment… Very well. Let's just get this over with. Where is this lab, then? And is there anything else I need to know before I go?
DOCTOR: The lab is right down that hallway, first door on the left. The phlebotomist will explain everything to you. Before you go, I'm going to give you a printed list of instructions for the fasting blood tests, just to be sure. Also, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you. A list of instructions… that’s good. No, I don’t think so. I just… want to get this over with. Alright then. I’ll go do the tests. Hopefully, they’ll figure something out. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. I'm hopeful we can get some answers soon. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are back. Take care.
PATIENT: .
