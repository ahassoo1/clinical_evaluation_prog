DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, so you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, right. Lab work. The usual, I guess. Doctor said something about needing it done. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. Just…the tests. Can we just get it over with? I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the lab work. Routine follow-up, according to the system. Though, frankly, I don’t see much detail here. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms that prompted a repeat of testing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not that I recall. Everything feels…old, if that counts. But that's just…being my age, isn't it? I haven’t felt sick, not really. Just tired a lot. Is that something to worry about? Look, I just want the blood drawn and know if anything's terribly wrong. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not too much to ask. Though “tired a lot” is…vague. Has this tiredness been recent?
PATIENT: Recent…well, when hasn't it been recent? Seriously, it comes and goes. Probably just the heat. It's been a scorcher lately, hasn't it? I used to work out in the sun all day, back at the power plant. Maybe it’s catching up with me. I don't know. Honestly, I forget half the things I did yesterday. Just…take the blood, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed with the lab work. Standard panel, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, lipid panel…and I'll add a thyroid stimulating hormone test, given the fatigue. We need to rule things out. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… latex… I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a kid? Something with balloons, I vaguely remember. As for medications… I take a little something for my… joints, I think. A white pill. I don’t really pay attention to the names. Is that important? This is all a bit much, you know. I just need to make sure I'm not about to drop dead.
DOCTOR: A white pill… excellent. We’ll need to get the name of that, if possible. Do you happen to know the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? No, no. I just… the pharmacist gives it to me. I go to Patel’s down on Elm Street. He's a nice man. He knows what I need. Look, I’m not good with details. Is this slowing things down? I really should be getting home. Is the blood draw going to hurt? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick prick, Mr. Croonquist. Minimal discomfort. However, we need to establish what you’re taking, for your safety. We can call Patel’s after the bloodwork, if you prefer. Let's proceed with that first, and then we'll sort out the medication list. Do you have any family history of medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, dear. My brother, Omar, he had… something with his heart, I think. Years ago. He lived in Kabul, you know. Never saw him much after… well, never mind. And my mother… she just… got old, I guess. Everyone on her side was pretty hardy, if that makes sense. No one really died of anything, just… faded away. This is giving me a headache. Can we just get the blood work done? I’m really not good with remembering all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. "Heart condition" in brother, no specific details. Fair enough. Let’s get this done. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in and draw your blood. We'll start with that. She'll explain the procedure. Then, we’ll try to confirm that medication name. It’s vital for ensuring your safety, Mr. Croonquist.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… make it quick, please. And tell her to use a small needle. A very small needle. I get lightheaded easily. Honestly, this is a whole ordeal just to make sure I’m not about to… well. Just get it over with. .
DOCTOR: I’ll inform her. Please have a seat and try to relax. Nurse Davies, could you please come in and draw blood from Mr. Croonquist?
