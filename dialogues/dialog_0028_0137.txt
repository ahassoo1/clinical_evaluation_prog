DOCTOR: Right. Lindra Abdollahi. Seventy-two. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Is… Memmolo, right? Yes. My husband and I… we thinking about a place for me to live. A… a nice place. For old people. He want me to be safe, you know? So we need to… check if I am okay for it. A senior… what you call it? Living.
DOCTOR: A senior living facility. Right. And you’re here for a general check-up to… determine suitability?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Exactly. Suitability. Is good word. They want to know… everything. If I can… walk good? If I remember things? Is… a lot of questions. My husband, he make the appointment. He worry too much, sometimes. But is good. He love me. So… you check me, and you tell them if I am okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can do that. We'll run through a standard evaluation. It will involve some questions about your medical history, a physical exam, and a brief cognitive assessment. Just to get a baseline. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, arthritis…?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think. My back, is not good. Always hurts a little. And sometimes my knees. Is the old age, I think. And… oh! I have the pressure. The blood… the doctor give me pills for it. Years ago. I take them every day. Is that… what you mean? Chronic? Is the pressure, I think. And the back. And the knees. Not so bad, usually.
DOCTOR: Right. So, back pain, knee pain, and… hypertension – high blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… no. I don't remember the name. Is a little white pill. I take it with breakfast. My husband… he get it for me. He know all the names. I just… take it. Is okay, though. It keep the pressure down. I think. He never let me worry about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to confirm that medication. And the dosage. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Years ago, when I was younger… I have the baby, the first one. That is a surgery, yes? And… I think I have something on my eye, once. A little thing. Not big surgery. Just… they fix it. Very quick. A long time ago, though. Maybe… forty years ago? I don't remember much. Is everything okay? You look… worried.
DOCTOR: Right. Cesarean section for the first child and… a minor procedure on your eye. We’ll need to verify the details. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh… I don't think so. I eat everything. Mango, fish, chicken… everything. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I touch the cats, but is not… bad. Not a real allergy. Just a little… tickle. My daughter has allergies, bad ones. But me, no. I think. I never have to go to the hospital for allergies. Is that okay? You are writing a lot.
DOCTOR: Fine. No known drug allergies. Let's move on. Do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh… sometimes, for the pain. When my back hurts very bad. Just a little pill. The yellow one. My husband… he give it to me when I need it. Is not every day. Just… when I can't sleep. Is… for the nerves, I think. He say. I don’t know. Is not important, maybe? Just a little help for the pain.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she live a long time. Very long. Almost ninety. But she get… sick at the end. Old age, I think. My father… he die young. Heart, I think. He work very hard. And my sister… she have the sugar. The diabetes, yes. My husband's family… they are all healthy, I think. Not much sickness. Is that… enough? You need more? I try to remember. Is hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll note that. Let’s do a brief physical exam. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and reflexes. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can stand. Is a little hard sometimes, the knees, you know? But I am okay. Careful now… is slow. Do you want me to hold something? A chair, maybe?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are… diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can walk. Is okay. Not fast. I am careful. I don't want to fall. Is a little wobbly, maybe? But I am okay. Is that good enough? You see something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your walk is slightly unsteady, with a wider base than normal. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and cognitive function. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh… today… hmm. Is August, I know that. August… Is the second… or the third? I forget. My husband, he tell me. Is hard to remember. Is the second of August, maybe? I think so. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… close enough. Can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: Oh… the President… hmm. That is a hard one. Is a man, I know that. Is a… a nice man, I think. Is… is the one with the… hair? I see him on the television. I forget the name. Is very hard to remember names these days. Is it… Biden? Is that right? I think so. My husband, he watches the news. He knows all the names.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age and some memory concerns, and based on what you’ve told me, I recommend a more thorough neurological evaluation. I’ll also need to confirm your current medications with your husband and review your medical records. It's important to rule out any underlying causes for your memory issues. I will also need to speak with your husband before making any recommendations regarding placement in a senior living facility. It's best to be cautious. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… A… a neurological? Is that bad? My husband… he will be upset. I just… I want to be safe. And he worry so much. Is okay, I guess. If you think is best. But… can we talk to him first? Before you say anything bad? I just… I don't want to worry him. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can certainly discuss this with your husband. He can schedule a follow-up appointment. I'm also going to prescribe a low-dose Vitamin D supplement, just to rule out any deficiencies. It won't hurt. Here you go. I’ll have my nurse schedule the follow-up. And please, bring your husband with you. It’s important. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, I will. I will bring my husband. He will be glad you want to talk. Thank you for… checking me. Goodbye.
