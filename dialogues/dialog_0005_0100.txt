DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this drug test, I think? Medicare sent something about it. Honestly, things are a little blurry these days, you know? I just… got a letter and figured I should come in. It’s about work, right? Something to do with the equipment I operate?
DOCTOR: Right. Yes, Medicare does occasionally require drug screenings for certain positions, especially those involving safety-sensitive equipment. It's a bit… unusual for them to just send you with no further explanation, though. And you operate equipment at work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I do. Big machines, you know? For roads… paving, mostly. And tamping. It’s… loud. Very loud work. I've been doing it a long time. Not sure exactly how long, though. Things… slip my mind. It’s just… a job. Keeps me busy, at least. Is that what this test is about? To make sure I can still… operate safely?
DOCTOR: Possibly. It’s standard procedure to ensure operators of heavy machinery aren't impaired. Before we proceed with the test, let's just clarify a few things. You said things slip your mind… are you experiencing any memory issues beyond just forgetting how long you've been at your job?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… well, yeah, I guess. It's not like… total blankness, but… names, dates… sometimes I have to ask people to repeat themselves. Or I’ll walk into a room and forget why I went in there. It’s mostly little things, really. Nothing… major, I don’t think. My late husband… he used to remind me of everything. It's different now, on my own. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes. Now, I'm going to ask a few more specific questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or focus?
PATIENT: Oh, concentrate… hmm. That’s a good question. I suppose… not as well as I used to. It’s harder to… stay on one thing, you know? I’ll be reading something and my mind will wander. Or someone will be talking and I’ll have to ask them to repeat it, like I said. It’s… frustrating. Especially at work, you really have to pay attention. I think I still manage, but… it takes more effort now, definitely. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking about. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Mood… well, I get sad sometimes, of course. Losing my husband… that was a big thing. It's been a few years now, but it still gets to me. I try to stay busy, like I said. Keeps my mind off things. I don't really… go out much anymore. Mostly just keep to myself. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, but… I'm not exactly cheerful, if that makes sense. Behavior… I don't know. Am I doing anything weird? I don't think so.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hughston, you're not doing anything weird. Just trying to get a full picture. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, the doctor gave me something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little something… like Tylenol PM, maybe? Nothing regular, though. Just when I really can’t get to sleep. Oh, and sometimes a multivitamin, if I remember. I get them at the drugstore. That’s about it, I think. Is that enough information? I’m really not good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll verify those medications with your pharmacy later. Now, just one more section before we get to the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes with certain flowers, maybe? But nothing serious. No bee stings or anything like that. And I don't think I've ever had a reaction to a medication. My husband always said I was lucky that way. I don’t really eat anything unusual either. No shellfish or anything. I really can't think of anything. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Thank you for that information. Now, before we proceed with the drug screening, I’m concerned about your reported memory changes, difficulty concentrating, and mood. Given your symptoms and your age, I think it would be prudent to do a brief cognitive assessment and some basic neurological checks. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's best to rule things out. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Oh… a cognitive assessment? What does that… involve? Is it going to be… difficult? I’m not very good at tests, you know. Especially when I have to… remember things. Will it take long? I have to get back to… well, I have things to do. But… if you think it’s important, I suppose I can try. Just… please be patient with me.
DOCTOR: It’s quite simple, Ms. Hughston. Just a few questions and simple tasks. We'll check your short-term memory, your ability to recall information, and some basic problem-solving skills. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. And, yes, I’ll be patient. We’ll take it at your pace. It's better to be thorough, you see. We want to be certain you're safe operating that equipment, and also to see if there is anything we can do to help you with these memory concerns. Would you like me to explain the tests to you briefly before we start?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That doesn’t sound too bad, I suppose. If it’s just questions… and it won't take long. And if it will help me… keep my job, that’s good. Yes, please, explain them to me. I like to know what I’m getting into. I get a little… flustered when I’m surprised. So, what kind of questions are we talking about? And what’s the… equipment involved? I’m a little worried about being… tested.
DOCTOR: Alright. The first part involves remembering three words. I’ll say three unrelated words, and you'll repeat them back to me. Then, later, I’ll ask you to recall those same three words. It tests your immediate and delayed recall. Then, we'll do a simple counting task – counting backwards from 100 by sevens. It assesses your attention and concentration. And finally, I’ll ask you to copy a drawing. It tests your visual-spatial skills. As for equipment, there's no equipment, Ms. Hughston. Just a pen and paper. It’s all very straightforward. We’re simply trying to get a baseline assessment of your cognitive function. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… three words? Counting backwards? That sounds… tricky. I'm not very good at math, you know. And remembering things is… well, you already know. But… alright. I’ll try. As long as it's just pen and paper, and you’re patient with me. Can I… pause if I need to? And what happens if I… get the wrong answer? Will I… fail the test? I don't want to lose my job over a few silly words.
DOCTOR: You can pause whenever you need to, Ms. Hughston. And there’s no such thing as failing the test. It’s simply an assessment, not an exam. The results will help me understand what’s going on and determine if any further investigation is needed. If we identify any areas of concern, we can discuss appropriate next steps, which might include a referral to a specialist. But let’s not jump ahead. Let's just start with the three words. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Three words. Yes, I suppose I’m as ready as I’ll ever be. Please go ahead. And… if I forget them right away, don’t get mad, okay? My mind wanders, you know? It’s not my fault.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are… apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Now, please repeat those words back to me.
PATIENT: Oh… apple… table… …penny? Is that right? Oh dear… I… I think I’m already forgetting them. It’s just… they slipped away. Like sand through my fingers. See? I told you my mind wanders. This isn’t going to work, is it?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Hughston. It's common to have some difficulty recalling information, especially with distractions. We'll move on. Now, let’s try the counting. Can you please count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh… counting backwards? By sevens? That sounds… impossible. I can barely count forwards, let alone backwards! Oh dear, this is awful. I… I can’t do that, Doctor. I just… can’t. I’ll make a mess of it, I know I will. Is there anything else we can do? Anything that doesn't involve numbers? I’m getting flustered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. It appears this assessment is not yielding useful information at the moment. Let's stop here. I'm concerned about your cognitive difficulties, and I think it would be best to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. We need to determine the cause of these issues and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Before we proceed with the blood tests, I want to be clear: this doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. But it's better to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests? A neurologist? That sounds… serious. Is it… something bad? I don’t want anything bad. I just want to keep my job. Will they… take my job away? And a neurologist… that sounds expensive. I’m on a fixed income, you know. This is all too much. I just came in for a silly drug test! .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, please try to remain calm. A blood test and referral to a neurologist does not automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It’s a precautionary measure. We're simply gathering more information to determine the cause of your symptoms. As for the cost, we'll work with your insurance to ensure the tests and consultation are covered. It’s likely Medicare will cover a significant portion, if not all, of the expenses. Look, I understand this is stressful, but we need to address these concerns. It's important for your health, and also for your safety, especially given your job. We'll take it one step at a time. First, we'll schedule the blood tests. Then, we'll get you an appointment with the neurologist. We'll discuss all of this in detail and address any concerns you have. Does that sound alright?
