DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 51 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you to my office?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, Lytisha, that’s right. Fifty-one… seems like yesterday, honestly. Um… well, honestly, I'm not entirely sure why I'm here. Something about a… test? My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment for me. Said it was important. A screening, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right. A screening. Well, that’s… not ideal, relying on family members to recall medical appointments. Do you have any specific concerns at all, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: No, no, not really concerns. I just… I mean, I feel alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, you know, but who isn't? I work out on the road a lot, with the equipment… paving, that’s what I do. It’s physical work. Maybe that's it? I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense. Honestly, I don't remember the doctor mentioning anything specific when I scheduled it… or if I even scheduled it, come to think of it.
DOCTOR: Well, “feeling alright” isn’t always enough, Ms. Hughston. Routine screenings are important for preventative care, even without overt symptoms. It’s good to catch things early. And relying on a vague recollection of scheduling is… less than optimal. Let’s try to establish a clearer picture. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A primary… doctor? I used to, back when my husband was… well, never mind. It’s been a while. I haven’t really needed one, I guess. Just the occasional check-up when something felt off, and then I’d go to the urgent care. I don't think I have a regular one now, no. Does that matter? Is it important? I feel like I'm just rambling… sorry.
DOCTOR: It matters a great deal, Ms. Hughston. Having a consistent physician allows for proper tracking of your health history. Urgent care is for… emergencies, not preventative maintenance. Very well. Let's proceed as if this is a new patient visit, then. To start, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… I had my tonsils out when I was little, that's something. And… oh! A broken wrist, years ago, when I was learning to drive a backhoe. Nothing major. And… honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. I get confused easily. I think I had high blood pressure once, but that was a long time ago. My husband always took care of the details. I really wish he was here… Is there a list somewhere? Maybe something I can look at to jog my memory?
DOCTOR: We can try to reconstruct your history, Ms. Hughston, but your recollection is… crucial. We do have forms you could fill out, but given your difficulty remembering, they may not be entirely accurate. Let’s try this. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your tonsillectomy and broken wrist?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh… there was that time, a long time ago. Not a hospital exactly, more like a… clinic. I fell off a… a tractor, I think? I was helping my husband with the harvest. It wasn't too bad, just a few bruises and a sprained ankle, I think. They kept me overnight to make sure I was alright. That was… oh goodness, must have been thirty years ago. It all feels so blurry. Was that what you meant? A real hospital? Or just… a place where they fixed me up? I'm so confused.
DOCTOR: Let's clarify. A farm clinic visit, thirty years ago, for injuries sustained in a fall. Not a hospital admission, as such. And we’re not focused on every minor injury, Ms. Hughston. We’re looking for significant medical events. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. I eat pretty much everything. My husband always said I had a cast iron stomach. He’d tease me about it. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I haven't had any reactions to any medications… at least, not that I remember. Maybe a little bit of a rash once, when I took something for a cold, but it went away quickly. Is that important? I really can't remember the name of the medicine. It was years ago. I just try to avoid taking anything if I can.
DOCTOR: A vague recollection of a possible, minor rash… is not particularly helpful, Ms. Hughston. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh… Well, there’s this one. My daughter gave it to me. She worries about my… joints. Says they look a bit achy. It's… glucosamine, I think? And… Oh, and a multivitamin. Just a basic one. I take that every morning. That's about it, I think. Honestly, I forget half the time. Sometimes I miss a day… or two. Is that bad? It’s just… so many things to remember.
DOCTOR: Glucosamine and a multivitamin. Sporadically taken, it appears. Right. Now, Ms. Hughston, to help me get a complete picture of your health, let's discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh… No, Doctor. They've both passed. My mother, she died when I was young, a long time ago. Heart trouble, I think. And my father… he passed a few years back. Old age, mostly. He was a strong man, but… He had… I think he had high blood pressure too. And diabetes, maybe? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. My sister is still alive, though. She lives in Florida. But we don't talk much. I don’t really know much about her health, either. We haven’t seen each other in years. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Parents deceased; mother - heart trouble; father - possible hypertension and diabetes. Limited information available regarding sibling’s health. Alright. Ms. Hughston, let's briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but he gave it up years ago. He said it was bad for his health. I always told him to stop, and eventually he did. No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink much either, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy. I try to stay healthy, you know? As healthy as I can. Although, working on the road all day… it’s hard to eat right all the time. And the dust… it can’t be good for you. But what can you do?
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption. Outdoor work with potential dust exposure. Right. Now, Ms. Hughston, given your daughter scheduled this appointment… and your rather vague recollection of the reason… are you experiencing any specific symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… Now that you mention it… I have been a little tired lately, like I said before. And… my hands ache sometimes, especially in the mornings. And… I've been a bit forgetful, which is probably just old age, but… it’s gotten worse, I think. And… sometimes I feel a little… dizzy, but it doesn’t last long. Just a fleeting feeling, really. Nothing major. Is that what you mean by symptoms? I don’t know… It’s hard to explain. Things just feel… off, sometimes. A little bit out of focus.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, hand pain, increased forgetfulness, occasional dizziness… All rather non-specific, but noted. Let’s review some of your vital signs. And then we’ll do a brief physical exam to assess your overall condition. Please sit up straight and relax.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Blood pressure, you say? I always get a bit anxious when someone takes my blood pressure. My husband always said I had a white coat effect. I’ll try to relax, Doctor. Just… let me know if I need to do anything special. This is all a bit… overwhelming, you know? I wish I knew why I was here.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Some mild swelling and tenderness noted in the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally. Do you experience pain in those joints regularly, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. It comes and goes, mostly in the mornings, like I said. And after I’ve been working on the road all day. It's not terrible, just… a bit achy. Sometimes it makes it hard to grip things. Opening jars can be a real struggle. I just thought it was part of getting older, you know? Arthritis, maybe? My mother had trouble with her hands too. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The mild swelling and tenderness in your metacarpophalangeal joints, coupled with your reported pain and family history, is suggestive of possible osteoarthritis. However, given your other symptoms—fatigue, forgetfulness, occasional dizziness—and the fact that this is a new patient visit, I want to order some basic blood work to rule out other potential causes. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. We’ll also check your erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to assess for inflammation. Do you have any questions about these tests, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like… a lot of tests. A complete blood… what was it? A panel? And my… thyroid? I don’t think I’ve ever had any of those tests before. Are they… painful? Will they take a lot of blood? I’m not very good with needles, you know. And the thought of all those… results… What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: The tests are not painful, Ms. Hughston. They involve a simple blood draw—a small amount of blood will be taken from your arm. The results will help me determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out any underlying medical conditions. The complete blood count assesses your overall health and detects any signs of infection or anemia. The comprehensive metabolic panel evaluates your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. The thyroid-stimulating hormone test checks your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can cause fatigue and other symptoms. And the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein assess for inflammation in your body. It is important to be thorough, Ms. Hughston. While it is possible that your symptoms are simply due to age-related changes, we need to rule out any other potential causes. I'll have the lab technician draw the blood today. It will take about 15 minutes. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they are available. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… fifteen minutes, you say? It sounds… complicated. So, it’s to check everything… to make sure it's not… anything serious? My daughter will be relieved to hear that you’re being so thorough. She worries about me a lot. Will the results take long? And… what if something is wrong? What happens then? I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I don't want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 2-3 business days to return from the lab. If something is amiss, we will discuss the findings in detail and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. It is important to remember that we are simply gathering information at this point. If any of the results are concerning, I may refer you to a specialist for further evaluation. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We will address any concerns one step at a time. For now, let’s focus on completing the blood work. The lab technician will call you with a time today. Do you have any further questions for me at this time, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so… carefully. And for being so patient with me. I’m not always very good at remembering things, you know. I’ll try not to worry too much until I get the results. And I’ll make sure my daughter is available when they call. Thank you again, Doctor Pipkorn. I suppose I’ll go and wait for the phone call.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hughston. Please do keep me informed. .
