DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Yamir. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I want to be sure I okay to… work games. It’s for… basketball mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a physical exam to make sure you're fit to referee basketball games. That's perfectly reasonable. Let me just pull up your information here… Okay, I see your name and age. And it says you have private insurance, which is good. To get started, can you tell me a little more about the level of refereeing you’re doing?
PATIENT: Yes. Level… uh… high school games. Sometimes college, small games. Not… big games. Just… checking is good. My wife… she gone last year. I want to make sure I… strong enough to do this still. It’s… hard. But I like refereeing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me, Yamir. It’s completely understandable that you want to be sure you’re physically up to it, especially given everything you’ve been through. It's good you're thinking about your health. So, high school and some small college games. That’s helpful to know. Let's start with a little about your general health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yes. Mostly. Some… tired. But work is hard. Lifting… heavy things for job. Not always… strong. Sometimes pain in back. But I take… medicine. Not every day. Just when bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly feeling well, but some fatigue, and occasional back pain that you manage with medication as needed. We’ll definitely want to talk more about both of those. Just to clarify, what kind of medicine are you taking for the back pain, and when was the last time you took it?
PATIENT: Uh… Ibuprofen. The… white pills. I take when I lift something heavy and back hurts a lot. Maybe… two weeks ago? Not sure exact. It help. Not… strong pain now. Just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain, last taken about two weeks ago. That's helpful. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No… not really. I break arm when young. Playing basketball. But… fixed. No… heart problems. No… diabetes. Nothing… doctor tell me is… bad. Just… regular checkups before.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear. A broken arm when you were younger, but otherwise no significant medical issues, and regular checkups in the past. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never. Just… arm fixed with… cast. That is all. Not cut or… anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Just the cast for your arm when you were younger. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of heart disease, diabetes, or other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he have high blood pressure. Mother… she okay. But… her sister have… something with heart. Old age. I think. Not sure what. We… not close family. Sorry. I don't know much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father has high blood pressure, and your aunt had some heart issues when she was older. That's good to know. It's perfectly alright that you don't have a lot of details, we can work with what you do know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. No… much alcohol. Maybe… one beer sometimes. Special day. And… no drugs. Never. I… work hard. Not time for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That's all good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had. I… eat anything. No… rash or… trouble breathing. Just… normal. Everything okay. I think. I don’t… remember anything bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s excellent. Alright, Yamir. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Do exam. I want to be sure. Make sure I okay. Do it. Quick is good. I have… games Saturday. If I… strong enough.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure… 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower back, but no signs of acute injury. Range of motion is slightly limited due to discomfort. Everything seems generally good, Yamir. You’re in reasonably good shape. The lower back tenderness is the main thing I’m noting. It doesn't seem acute, but it's something we should address.
PATIENT: Okay. Back okay? I can… referee? That is important. Not… hurt myself. That is why I came.
DOCTOR: Based on the exam, I don’t see anything that would completely prevent you from refereeing. However, the tenderness in your lower back suggests you could be at risk of re-injury if you push yourself too hard. To be more certain, I’d recommend an X-ray to rule out any underlying issues, like arthritis or a minor fracture. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Hmm… cost money. I… not sure. Can I… just try refereeing? Be careful? Maybe… not run so much? If… pain, I stop. Is that okay? I… need job. Saturday is important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, and your need to work. Okay, we can certainly try that approach – being mindful of your back, avoiding excessive running, and stopping immediately if you experience pain. However, I need to strongly advise you that without an X-ray, we can’t rule out a more serious problem. If you injure your back further without knowing what’s going on, it could lead to a more significant and long-lasting issue. To be clear, I am documenting that I advised an X-ray, and you’ve declined at this time. Given that you're determined to referee this weekend, let's focus on prevention. I can show you some simple stretches and exercises to strengthen your back muscles. And I recommend taking ibuprofen before the game, to help manage any potential pain. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Yes. Ibuprofen is okay. And… stretches. Show me stretches. Before game is good. And… be careful. I promise. Not push too hard. But… I like refereeing. It is… good for me. Not… sit at home. Thank you Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Yamir. I’m glad you're being proactive about this. I’m happy to show you some stretches. Okay, so this one is a gentle hamstring stretch. Keep your back straight and don’t bounce. And this one is a core strengthening exercise, focusing on tightening your abdominal muscles. And finally, a simple back extension to help improve flexibility. Do these several times a day, especially before you referee. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory medication, just in case the ibuprofen isn’t enough. And please, listen to your body. If you experience any sharp pain, stop immediately. Here’s a summary of our recommendations: Ibuprofen before the game. Prescription for stronger anti-inflammatory . Regular back stretches and exercises. Listen to your body and stop if you experience pain. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think okay. Thank you Doctor. You… very nice. I… feel better now. Knowing what to do. Stop if pain is good advice.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Yamir. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, if the pain worsens or doesn't improve, please come back and see me. And please reconsider the X-ray if things don’t get better. Have a good weekend, and be careful out there!
