DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. My foot… it’s been hurting. A long time now. It has a… a sore. A bad sore. It won't get better.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that hasn’t been healing. I see. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It's on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It… it feels deep. And sometimes, it hurts when I walk, even just a little bit. I try to stay off it, but… well, I still need to do things, you know? It's been like this for… maybe two months now? Hard to say exactly. Time goes fast when you get old.
DOCTOR: I understand. Two months is a good amount of time for something to be bothering you. And it’s smart to try and stay off of it when you can. When you say it feels “deep,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just on the skin. It feels… inside the foot, too. Like it’s not just a scrape, you know? It’s hard to explain. Not a cut, more like… a hole. And sometimes it… smells a little funny. I try to keep it clean, I really do, but… it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better idea. It sounds like it could be more than just a simple scrape, especially with it feeling deep and having a smell. We'll definitely need to take a look. Have you noticed any redness or swelling around the sore, or any pus draining from it?
PATIENT: Redness… yes, a little bit. Around the edges, sometimes. And… yes, there is some stuff that comes out. It’s… yellowish. Not a lot, but some. It makes my sock dirty. I try to wipe it away with a cloth. I don't know what it is, but it doesn’t look good.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yellowish drainage and redness are definitely things we need to check out. Do you have any fever or chills, or has your leg felt warm to the touch?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills… sometimes I feel a little cold, but that's just because I’m old! My leg… hmm. It feels… normal, I think. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I can’t be sure. It's hard to tell. I wear socks all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And you’re right, it is hard to tell sometimes. Let's take a look at your foot. If you don’t mind, I'm going to need to examine it. We'll check for any signs of infection, and I'll see how deep this sore is. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Go ahead. It's been bothering me so long, I just want to know what’s wrong. I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. I see the sore here. It does look a bit deeper than a simple scrape, and there is some redness and drainage as you described. Your pulses feel good, which is a positive sign. It looks like there is some dead tissue in there, which we call necrosis. This, along with the drainage, suggests an infection might be present. I'm concerned about the possibility of a deeper infection, and we need to rule out something called osteomyelitis, which is an infection in the bone. I'm going to order some labs and potentially an X-ray to get a better look. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Labs… and an X-ray? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Will I need… surgery? I don't want surgery, Doctor. I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Emiliano. It’s good we’re taking this seriously. The labs and X-ray will help us determine how serious it is, and guide our treatment. Right now, we don’t know enough to say if surgery is needed. Most likely, we can manage this with antibiotics and wound care. But we need to know the extent of the infection first. The labs will help us identify the type of bacteria causing the infection, and the X-ray will show us if it’s spread to the bone. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for signs of infection in your body, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to check your kidney function, and a wound culture to identify the bacteria. We’ll also do the X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… labs and X-ray. And you said… antibiotics? That sounds… better than surgery. I just want it to heal, Doctor. I just want to be able to walk again without pain. If you think that’s the best way, then yes, do what you need to do. What do I need to do for the labs? Do I have to drink anything special?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. We'll start with the labs and X-ray. For the labs, you don't need to do anything special. You'll just need to sit in a chair and someone will draw some blood from your arm. It's a quick pinch, and shouldn't take long. The X-ray is also quick; you’ll just stand or sit while the machine takes a picture of your foot. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw the blood now, and then we’ll go down to radiology for the X-ray. I’ll review the results as soon as they come back and we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, please try to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. And keep the wound clean and dry. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all right now. Just… please hurry, Doctor. I don’t want it to get any worse. And thank you… for taking care of me.
