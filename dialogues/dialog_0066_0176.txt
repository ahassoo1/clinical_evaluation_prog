DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, let me think… over two days now, maybe even a little longer. It's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over two days. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… I think it was after I had a really spicy meal with my friend Fatima. We went to that new Egyptian place downtown. Delicious food, but… yeah. They just kind of started randomly while we were talking, and haven’t really gone away since. I’ve tried holding my breath, like my grandmother always told me, and drinking water really fast, but nothing seems to help. They happen all the time, just… hic… out of the blue.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started after a spicy meal, and you’ve tried some common remedies without luck. Do you remember exactly what you ate at the restaurant?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It was a big platter, we shared. There was koshari, which is rice and pasta, and some grilled chicken, and… oh yes! Molokhia, that's the leafy green soup. And a lot of chili peppers. Fatima loves it really spicy. I had a smaller portion of the chili sauce, but still… it was quite a bit. And we both had hibiscus tea. I think that's everything. It was a big meal. hic Sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, hiccups and all. Okay, so a spicy meal with koshari, chicken, molokhia, chili peppers, and hibiscus tea. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups – anything like heartburn, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No vomiting, definitely not. No trouble swallowing. Heartburn… now that you mention it, yes, a little bit. Not terrible, just… a little burning in my chest a few times. And, actually, my stomach has felt a bit bloated. Not painful, just… full and uncomfortable. hic It's strange. It's like everything is just… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some heartburn and bloating along with the hiccups. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, have you had hiccups like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, you know, the normal ones that go away after a few minutes. But never anything that lasts this long. And certainly never with the bloating and heartburn. This is… different. Very different. hic It's worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ivette. Prolonged hiccups can be concerning. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally pretty healthy. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, no allergies that I know of. I was a little overweight, I suppose, but… that’s been the case for a while. hic And I don’t take any regular medications. Just over-the-counter things sometimes, for headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise generally healthy, no known allergies, and no regular medications. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – anything like esophageal issues, stomach problems, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had some problems with indigestion, always complaining of heartburn, but nothing diagnosed, just… old age, I think. And my uncle, on my father's side, had a stroke a few years back, but he was a heavy smoker. Nothing else really stands out. My family is pretty… robust, generally. hic Though, they all live back in Egypt, so it’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of indigestion in your mother and a stroke in your uncle. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. Too much trouble, I thought. And definitely no drugs. hic I like my tea, though, as you know. And I do enjoy a good sweet pastry now and then. But nothing beyond that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, alcohol, or drugs, enjoys tea and pastries. Okay, Ivette. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and maybe take a look in your throat. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. hic Please, go ahead. I just want these hiccups to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, if you’ll lie back for me, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Okay… a little bit of fullness, but no sharp pain. Your abdomen is soft. Now, open your mouth and say “ah.” Your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Blood pressure is 138/82, and pulse is 80. Overall, the exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately alarming. However, given the duration of the hiccups and the associated symptoms, I’d like to order a few tests, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, please do them. I just want to find out what’s causing this. hic It's really getting on my nerves. Which tests are you thinking about?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m thinking a complete blood count to rule out any infection, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a chest X-ray to rule out anything in your lungs. We can also check a Helicobacter pylori test, as sometimes that can cause persistent hiccups. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable. Those tests… they won’t take long, will they? And will they be expensive? I don’t have insurance, unfortunately. hic I worry about the cost sometimes. But I understand you have to do what’s necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Ivette. We’ll try to keep it as economical as possible. The blood tests and the X-ray shouldn’t take more than an hour or so, and the H. pylori test is usually a simple breath test that can be done quickly. Let me check the approximate cost for you… The CBC and BMP will be about $80 each, the chest X-ray around $100, and the H. pylori test is $50. So, roughly $260 in total. We do have a payment plan option if that helps. And we can also see if there are any local assistance programs that might be available. Would you like me to look into those for you?
PATIENT: $260… that’s… manageable, I think. Thank you for checking. And thank you for offering the payment plan. I think I can manage that. A payment plan would be very helpful. hic Please, go ahead with the tests. I just want to get this sorted out. When can we do them?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll get the orders entered for the CBC, BMP, chest X-ray, and H. pylori test. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is available right away. We can get those done today. The H. pylori test requires you to fast for a few hours beforehand, so we’ll schedule that for tomorrow morning. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Today for the blood work and X-ray, and tomorrow for the breath test. hic I’m glad we have a plan. Should I drink water before the blood work? And is there anything I should do to prepare for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes, please drink plenty of water before the blood work to stay hydrated. For the X-ray, you shouldn't need to do any special preparation – just wear comfortable clothing without any metal zippers or jewelry. And it's important to let the technician know if you are pregnant or think you might be. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that’s all clear. Drink water, comfortable clothes, no metal, and let the technician know if I’m pregnant. hic I think I have it. sighs It’s a relief to finally be doing something about this. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get these tests done, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Once we get the results back – usually within 24-48 hours – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. New or worsening symptoms – fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, severe abdominal pain – go to the emergency room. hic I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll go and do the blood work now. starts to get up I appreciate your patience with my… hic… condition.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. And don’t worry about the hiccups! We'll get to the bottom of this. The lab is just through that door to your left. A nurse will assist you. Let me know if you have any trouble finding it. And please, take a deep breath – we're on our way to getting this sorted out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. hic I will. .
DOCTOR: Okay, take care, Ivette. We’ll see you soon. .
