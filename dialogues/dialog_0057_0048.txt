DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this confusion. Happens now and then. Drives my wife nearly mad, it does. She says I ask the same questions five times in an hour. Not that I notice anything wrong, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, confusion that comes and goes, and your wife has noticed you repeating questions. That's helpful to know. And you don’t feel like you’re experiencing any difficulty with your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I feel perfectly sharp. It's others who are… slow to understand what I’m saying, perhaps. Or they don't listen properly the first time. It's not me. I remember everything just fine. Dates, names, prices... everything. It's just… sometimes I need to be certain they’ve got it right, you see? That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when there’s a disconnect in communication. So, it sounds like the concern is more about ensuring others understand you, and you’re not necessarily feeling confused yourself. When did you first start noticing this happening, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s crept up on us, really. Maybe… six months ago? My daughter was visiting from California, and my wife said I asked her three times if she’d eaten lunch. I thought my wife was exaggerating, honestly. But then it started happening with other things. Repeating what I just said to my son, asking the grocery store clerk the price of milk twice in a row. Small things, at first. Now… well, now my wife keeps a notepad. It’s embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, starting with instances like repeating questions to your daughter and son, and now your wife is keeping a notepad. That gives me a good starting point. Has this been gradual, or has it felt like it’s been getting worse quickly?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. Like a slow leak. Not sudden. It wasn't like I woke up one morning unable to remember my own name. More like… a little more repetition each week. My wife says it's been steadily increasing. She's very observant, my wife. Sometimes too observant, if you ask me. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your wife is very attuned to these changes, which is good. A slow, gradual progression is helpful information. Now, outside of the repetition, have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or memory?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. I still do the crossword puzzle every day, finish it in under an hour. I manage the bills, balance the checkbook. I know all the grandkids’ birthdays. I haven't lost my keys or anything silly like that. It’s just… this insistence on making sure people understand me. It's not a memory problem, Doctor. It’s a… a communication problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very reassuring – still able to do the crossword, manage finances, remember important dates. So, no difficulty with recalling facts or events, just this concern about ensuring clear communication. Have you noticed any difficulty finding the right words when you speak, or understanding what others are saying to you?
PATIENT: No, I understand everything perfectly well. People mumble sometimes, but that’s their fault, not mine. And I haven't been searching for words, no. I say what I mean, plain and simple. It’s just… sometimes I need to repeat what I mean, to make sure they’ve heard what I mean. It’s frustrating, I tell you. They think I’m… losing it. But I’m not.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason, and it’s good that you’re able to articulate all of this so clearly. It sounds like you’re very aware of what’s going on, and you’re rightly concerned about being dismissed. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure’s been a little high for years, the doctor back home said. I take a pill for it, a small white one, every morning. Other than that, nothing much. I had a touch of the flu last winter, but everyone gets the flu, don’t they? And my knees ache a bit when it rains, but that’s just old age, I suppose. My wife keeps telling me to lose weight, but I enjoy my food. What does high blood pressure have to do with… this confusion, anyway?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure managed with medication. And some knee pain, and a bout of the flu last winter. High blood pressure can sometimes affect cognitive function, which is why I ask, but we'll explore all possibilities. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital for anything serious. A broken arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree. And I had a bad case of malaria when I was visiting my sister in Cambodia a long time ago, but that was decades ago. Fully recovered, of course. Doctor said it was a miracle I pulled through. Nothing since then, honestly. I’m a strong man, you see? Good genes. Strong Khmer blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, and a bout of malaria many years ago, fully recovered. That’s helpful to know. Do you take any other medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one white pill every morning. I take it with my coffee. My wife reminds me. She’s very particular about my pills. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. Just the one white pill. I don't like taking a lot of pills, you see. Makes me feel… sluggish. And I don't trust those fancy supplements anyway. All marketing, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the one white pill for blood pressure. And no allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. Spicy food, shellfish, you name it. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, says I need more fiber, but I prefer a good curry. Never been allergic to anything in my life. Strong stomach, you see? Khmer people are known for our resilience.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your family. Has anyone in your family experienced memory problems or confusion?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… well, she was a bit forgetful in her later years, I suppose. But everyone forgets things when they get old, right? My father was sharp as a tack until the day he died. And my siblings… no, not that I’m aware of. They’re all still living, thankfully, and seem to be… perfectly alright. It wasn’t anything like this, mind you. Just… normal old age forgetfulness. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some forgetfulness in her later years, but nothing significant. Everyone else seems to be doing well. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and absolutely not. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My wife doesn't approve, and frankly, I don't see the point. Smoking? Horrible habit. Gives you cancer, you know. And drugs? Preposterous. I’m a respectable man, Doctor. I work hard, I provide for my family, I don’t need those things. A good strong cup of Khmer coffee is all I need.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Lason. That gives me a good picture of your lifestyle. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about what your daily routine looks like?
PATIENT: Well, I wake up around six, have my coffee with my wife. She makes a lovely strong brew, you see. Then I do the crossword puzzle. Takes me about an hour, usually. After that, I usually go to the garden. I grow tomatoes, peppers, some herbs. My wife does most of the cooking, but I help with the weeding. In the afternoon, I read the newspaper. And then we have dinner together. It’s a simple life, but it’s a good life. We keep busy. I like to stay active, you see. Keeps the mind sharp.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling routine, Mr. Lason. Staying active and engaged is excellent. Alright, I think it’s time to do a brief physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment – just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m a reasonable man. Though I’ll tell you, my blood pressure is probably a little high right now, just from all the questions. All this talk about confusion… it’s a bit unsettling, you see. But go ahead. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, as you suspected, 150 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance seems steady. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat a few words back to me. Can you repeat these three words for me: apple, table, pencil?
PATIENT: Apple, table, pencil. Perfectly simple. I told you I have a good memory. Now, are we finished with these tests? It’s a little… undignified, if you ask me, being poked and prodded like this. But I’m cooperating, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, you recalled those words perfectly. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Just to assess a different aspect of your cognitive function. Take your time, no rush.
PATIENT: D…L…R…O…W… L…D…R…O…W… No, wait. R…O…W…D…L… No. It’s… it’s difficult. My mind is… a little foggy all of a sudden. Just give me a moment, Doctor. My wife always says I’m better at doing things than saying things.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Lason. It's alright to struggle. It's just a quick assessment. If you need a moment, that’s perfectly fine. No pressure at all. We can come back to it if you’d like.
PATIENT: No, no… let me think. D…L…R…O…W… W…O…R…D… No, that’s not right. It’s… it’s on the tip of my tongue. I know this word. My wife and I read the newspaper every day! It’s… Ugh. It’s ridiculous! I can remember everything from my childhood, but I can’t spell a simple word backwards? This is embarrassing. D…L…R…O…W… I… I give up, Doctor. It’s… it’s gone.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Lason. Don’t feel bad at all. It’s not about being “smart” or “not smart.” It’s just a test to assess different cognitive functions, and sometimes those functions aren’t as reliable as others. Okay. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the brief exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The fact that you are experiencing some difficulty with recall and spelling backwards, coupled with your wife’s observations, is something we need to take seriously. It could be a number of things – everything from normal age-related changes to something more concerning like early signs of cognitive impairment. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this – things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or infections. And I’d also like to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Well, that sounds… serious. But I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? Blood work, fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please don’t tell my wife everything right away. She worries enough as it is. She'll make a mountain out of a molehill, you see. And I don't want to be fussed over constantly. But yes, let's do the tests. Let's figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll get the blood work ordered, and I’ll write a referral to a neurologist. I understand your concern about your wife, and we can discuss how to present the results to her in a way that’s sensitive and manageable. I’ll also give you some information about cognitive health to review in the meantime. We’ll start with a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and vitamin B12 and D levels. And I’ll recommend a neurologist who specializes in memory disorders. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will the neurologist… will they be able to tell me what’s wrong? I don’t want to be left in the dark, you see. I need to know what’s going on with my mind. It’s… unsettling, to feel like something isn’t right. But thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And for not dismissing me as just an old man losing his marbles.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lason. It's my job to listen and help you figure things out. The blood work usually takes a few days to come back – typically 3-5 business days. Once I have the results, I’ll review them with you and discuss the next steps. As for the neurologist, they will conduct a more thorough evaluation, including cognitive tests and possibly brain imaging, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. They’ll be able to provide you with a diagnosis and discuss treatment options if needed. I’ll also be here to support you throughout the process. Here's some information about cognitive health and the contact information for the neurologist. Do you have any questions about scheduling the appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think I can manage scheduling it. Thank you. And… thank you again, Doctor. It’s… a relief to have a plan. It’s just… I want to be myself, you see? I don't want to lose my mind. I still have things to do, people to see. I suppose I’ll head home now. And I’ll try not to worry too much. But if I forget where I live, I’ll be sure to call.
DOCTOR: You take care of yourself, Mr. Lason. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. We’ll work through this together. And remember, you are not alone. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results.
