DOCTOR: Hello Janeth, good morning. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. It's…fine to meet you. Honestly, it's a bit silly, but I was hoping you could just…write me a little card. A "get well" card, or something encouraging. My daughter, she thinks it would cheer me up. I haven't been sick, exactly. Just…feeling a bit down, you know? It's the summer heat, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janeth. It's not silly at all to want a little encouragement, especially if your daughter thinks it would help. Sometimes a small gesture can make a big difference. And the heat can certainly get people feeling low. Before I write that card for you, would you mind if I just ask a few questions, just to get a better sense of how you’re doing overall?
PATIENT: Oh, questions. Sigh. Well, alright, I suppose. But don't expect a long story. I don’t really do details, you know? Just the important bits. And please, don’t ask me about my diet. I eat what I like.
DOCTOR: Of course, just the important bits is perfectly fine. And no pressure about diet at all! We’ll skip that entirely. Let’s start with how long you've been feeling this way – just a bit down, as you described it. Has this been a recent thing, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…hard to say. A few weeks, maybe? Honestly, the whole summer has been a bit…off. Not bad, just…not good. It’s the humidity, I think. It makes everything feel sticky and…difficult. My bones ache a little too, but that's probably just old age catching up. Don't worry about it. It’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, and it seems the humidity might be playing a part. And you've noticed some bone aches as well. Okay. When you say "bone aches," where exactly are you feeling those?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. My knees, mostly. And my lower back. But it comes and goes. It's not constant pain, you understand? Just…a dull ache. Like I've been carrying heavy things, even when I haven’t. My husband says I worry too much, but he doesn’t understand. He's always been a practical man. Doesn’t see the little things.
DOCTOR: I see. So, mostly in your knees and lower back, coming and going, a dull ache. And you feel it even when you haven’t been particularly active. I understand your husband doesn’t see it the same way, and that can be frustrating. Now, besides the ache and feeling down, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been keeping a list. I live my life, you know? I don't go around cataloging every little thing. But…maybe I've been sleeping a bit more. And I don't have the energy I used to for gardening. My tomatoes are looking pathetic, and it's August! That's not normal. It's usually a bumper crop by now.
DOCTOR: Okay, sleeping a bit more and less energy for gardening, especially with the tomatoes not doing well. That is helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, Janeth?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well… it comes and goes. Some days I can eat a whole plate of dal bhat, and other days… I just pick at things. It’s not that I don’t want to eat, you know? It’s just…nothing sounds particularly appealing. Especially sweets. I used to love sel roti with tea, but now… it just feels too rich. My daughter keeps offering me mango lassi, but I have to decline. It’s all a bit…off.
DOCTOR: So, appetite fluctuating, sometimes good, sometimes not, and a loss of interest in sweets specifically. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your weight, even if it’s just a feeling that your clothes fit a little differently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a silly question. Of course not! I don’t weigh myself. I’m a woman of…certain stature, you know? Scales are for…other people. But my daughter keeps saying I'm looking thin. She worries too much. Honestly, I think she just wants an excuse to cook me more food. Which is very sweet, but… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your daughter is very attentive. Okay, so no intentional weight monitoring, but she has commented on your appearance. Just a few more questions, and then we can get to that card. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with your sleep besides just sleeping more?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, you ask too many questions! But alright. I fall asleep easily enough. It’s staying asleep that’s the problem. I wake up in the middle of the night. Sometimes just once, sometimes two or three times. I don’t really hurt, but… I'm just restless. My mind goes and goes and goes. Thinking about… things. Silly things, mostly. But it keeps me awake. And the house is so quiet at night, you know? Too quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, falling asleep easily, but restless sleep with frequent awakenings and a racing mind. And the quiet house bothers you. One last set of questions, I promise. And this is just to rule things out. Have you noticed any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, you are relentless! Fever? No. Chills? Only when the air conditioning is too strong. Night sweats? No, thankfully. And I told you, I don’t weigh myself! You are just asking the same questions again, in a different way. Honestly, I think my daughter sent me here just to… irritate me with medical inquiries. It’s all a bit… much. Can we please just get to the card?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to tell me if you’re feeling overwhelmed, Janeth. I apologize if I was relentless. It’s just my job to try and rule out any potential causes for how you're feeling. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of mild depression, possibly triggered by the summer heat and changes in your routine. The low energy, sleep disturbance, loss of appetite, and feeling down are all consistent with that. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions, especially given the aches and the changes in sleep. So, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests just to be sure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, for goodness sake! Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit… unnecessary. I told you, it’s just the heat! I’ve lived a long life, I know my body. It's just a bit… out of sorts. Look, can we please just forget the tests and get to the card? I just want a little encouragement, something to cheer me up. My daughter will be so disappointed if I come home empty-handed. Honestly, all this questioning is making me more down than I was before. Just write the card, Doctor. Please. A simple “get well soon” or “thinking of you” will do. It’s not that hard.
DOCTOR: You are right, Janeth. You are absolutely right. I got caught up in the process and lost sight of what you came here for. I apologize for pushing you. It's your well-being that matters, and if you feel strongly about skipping the tests, then we will. I’m happy to write you a card, and I’ll make sure it’s filled with encouraging words. Let me just grab a pen and paper… While I’m writing, I want to assure you that it’s okay to not be okay, and it’s perfectly valid to seek a little comfort and support. If you find these feelings persisting or worsening, please don't hesitate to reach out to your daughter or a trusted friend, and we can always revisit this if you change your mind. Here you go. I hope this brings you a little cheer. I've also included a list of resources for coping with low mood, just in case. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Well… that's… nice. Thank you, Doctor. It's… very colorful. My daughter will probably like it. No, I think that's all. I just wanted the card, and you’ve given me that. And a lot of questions, but… never mind. I appreciate your time. I suppose I should go home now. And try to convince my husband that I need more air conditioning. And maybe a mango lassi. Even if I don't really want one. It’s the thought that counts, you know? Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Janeth. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, taking care of yourself is important, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a wonderful day, and please give my best to your husband and daughter. .
