DOCTOR: Right. So, Ms. Hainley, you’re here today…tell me what brought you in. Don't leave anything out. I have limited time, you understand.
PATIENT: Well, okay. It’s my bruising. I’ve been getting bruises… a lot of them, lately. And they seem bigger than usual, even for just bumping into things. I’m on…a blood thinner, the doctor put me on it a few months back. It’s just…worrisome, you know? I don’t want to end up in the hospital because of a little bump.
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Warfarin, I think it is. Little orange pills. I take one every night. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when I started, but it was after… that small surgery on my knee. Dr. Sharma prescribed it. She’s good, but… this bruising is new, and it’s getting worse, even though I haven't changed anything about taking the pills.
DOCTOR: Right. And how exactly are these bruises occurring?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not even hard bumps. Like, I walked into the corner of the kitchen island the other day – not even a fast walk, just…a normal walk – and ended up with a bruise the size of my hand. And yesterday, I just… grazed my arm on the doorframe. Small one. Big purple mark now. It’s just…weird. Usually I don’t even notice bumping into things, you know? I’m not fragile or anything.
DOCTOR: Hm. And have you noticed any other… unusual bleeding?
PATIENT: Bleeding… like, other than the bruising? Let me think. My gums bleed a little when I brush sometimes, but I always figured that was just…sensitive gums. Nothing major, honestly. Oh! And my nose has been a little stuffy lately and I've had to blow it a few times and there's been a tiny bit of blood mixed in, but it's not a nosebleed, you know? Just…pink when I blow my nose. It's probably nothing, though. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing" isn't a medical assessment, Ms. Hainley. Let’s get a few things straight here. You're on warfarin, which means your blood doesn't clot as easily. Any unexplained bleeding, even seemingly minor, needs to be investigated. Now, when was the last time you had your INR checked?
PATIENT: INR… oh, geez. That's the blood test, right? I... I honestly don't remember. Dr. Sharma told me I needed to get it done regularly, but…I’ve been busy with work and… it just slipped my mind. I think it was… maybe a month or two ago? But I really don’t know for sure. I can look up the appointment reminders on my phone, if you want?
DOCTOR: Don’t bother. If you haven’t had a recent INR check while on warfarin and you’re experiencing increased bruising and nosebleeds, it’s highly likely your medication is not within the therapeutic range. I’m going to need to examine you, Ms. Hainley. And we're going to need to get a blood test done immediately. And frankly, given your insurance status, you really should have been more diligent with this.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. I'm sorry, I just… things have been stressful. I will get it checked more regularly, I promise. What kind of examination? And where do we get the blood test done? Is it here? I don't have a lot of time today, you see...
DOCTOR: We'll start with a basic physical exam—checking your blood pressure, looking at the bruises, palpating your abdomen, things like that. It won't be extensive. And yes, fortunately, we can draw the blood here at the clinic. It'll take a few minutes. Now, tell me about any other medications you’re taking—prescription, over-the-counter, even vitamins or supplements. Be thorough. And, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Okay. Let's see… besides the Warfarin, I take a multivitamin – one of those gummy ones, every morning. And sometimes, if my knee is really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Just two pills, when I need them. That's it, really. No other prescriptions. Other symptoms… not really. Just… tired, I guess? But I'm always a little tired. And maybe a bit more thirsty than usual, but it’s been hot lately, so that could be it. No dizziness, no headaches, no… anything else, really. I just want to make sure this isn't something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen and warfarin aren't a good combination, Ms. Hainley. They both thin the blood, increasing your risk of bleeding. You need to avoid taking ibuprofen while on warfarin. We'll make a note of that. Now, let’s have a look at these bruises. Please, have a seat and extend your arms.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. No ibuprofen, got it. Here. You can see them pretty easily, I think. This one on my forearm is from yesterday, just bumping the door. And this one on my knee… I don’t even remember how that one happened. They are bigger than usual, honestly. And… they don’t seem to be going away as quickly as they used to.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, these are… substantial. And tender to the touch. You're right, they appear larger than what I’d expect from minor trauma, even with warfarin. Palpating your abdomen now. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little…full, maybe? But I ate lunch not long ago, so that’s probably it. It's just a little uncomfortable, that's all. My stomach gets a bit upset sometimes, but it's nothing major. Mostly just bloating, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned being more thirsty than usual?
PATIENT: Yes. I'm drinking a lot more water than I normally do. And I feel like I'm having to pee more often, too. It's probably just the heat, though. It’s been really hot, like I said. But… I don’t know. I just feel… off, you know? Not like myself. Is this serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hainley, given your increased bruising, nosebleeds, the fact that you haven’t had a recent INR check, and now you’re mentioning increased thirst and frequent urination… I need to rule out a few things. While it could simply be an issue with your warfarin dosage, these symptoms warrant further investigation. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and, of course, an INR. We'll also need to do a urinalysis. I also want to check your thyroid function. These tests will give us a better picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot of tests. Will these tests take long? And… are you saying it could be something serious? I just want to make sure it’s not anything… really bad. I have a meeting tomorrow, and I really can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hainley, I understand your concern. I'm not saying it is anything serious, but we need to be thorough. These tests are routine, and will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. The blood and urine tests will take a few hours to process. We should have the results back by the end of the day. I’ll review them as soon as they’re available and contact you immediately. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to avoid any strenuous activity and absolutely no ibuprofen. Now, let's get these tests ordered.
PATIENT: Okay… no ibuprofen. Got it. And I’ll try to take it easy. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. Can I at least get a print-out of what tests you’re ordering, so I can show it to Dr. Sharma if I need to?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. This lists all the tests I've ordered. And please, do contact Dr. Sharma if you have any concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. And Ms. Hainley?
