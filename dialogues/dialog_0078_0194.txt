DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhaugh. My name is Dr. Solero, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Welcome to the clinic. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it's my hearing, mostly. It comes and goes, you see. And with it, this… spinning feeling. Awful dizziness. It’s been happening on and off for… oh, goodness, I can’t quite put my finger on how long. It feels like a while, though. My daughter, she's the one who really pushed me to come in. She says I shouldn’t ignore it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your daughter looking out for you, and it’s good you’re here. It’s always best to get these things checked out. So, the hearing loss and dizziness come and go together, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Usually, it starts with a sort of… muffled sound. Like someone turned the volume down. Then… whoosh! Everything spins. Not always though, sometimes it's just the muffled hearing. And it doesn't last long, usually. A few hours, maybe. But it’s unsettling, you know? Especially when I’m trying to… well, I spend a bit of time at the casino, you see, and it makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound unsettling, and it makes perfect sense that it would be disruptive to your activities. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. When you say "muffled sound," does it affect both ears equally, or is it worse in one ear?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question… I honestly can’t say for sure. I think… maybe it’s worse in my left ear? But sometimes it’s hard to tell. Everything just sounds… distant. And I’ve noticed… well, my family, my mother’s side, they had… issues with their ears. Something about balance, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A family history of ear issues can be important. And it's perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the details. We can work through this. Now, when you experience this dizziness, is it a spinning sensation—like the room is moving around you—or more of a feeling of being unsteady on your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely spinning. Like… like being on a boat, a really small boat in choppy water. Everything goes round and round. Makes me feel quite sick, actually. I have to sit down straight away. And sometimes… sometimes I get a ringing in my ears too, along with the muffled sound. It's… it’s a bit frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That sounds very unpleasant, and it’s understandable that it would be frightening. The spinning sensation along with the ringing and muffled hearing gives us a few more clues. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… triggers? Hmm. Not really. It just… comes on. Sometimes I’m walking, sometimes I’m just sitting. The casino can be loud, maybe? But I’ve been going there for years, and it hasn’t always happened at the casino. I really can’t pinpoint anything. And honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhaugh. We’ll work with what you can recall. It’s helpful to know it doesn’t seem consistently linked to any one activity. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so they keep an eye on things. I had my gallbladder out years ago, and… oh, and arthritis, in my hands mostly. It gets a bit painful, especially when it’s cold. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I try to stay active, walk when I can, though the arthritis makes it harder sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and arthritis, thank you. And you’re on Medicare, which is good – that gives us some records to look at. Are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Yes, I take something for the arthritis. Ibuprofen, I think? A white pill. And sometimes, when it's really bad, the doctor gives me something stronger. A yellow one. But I don’t take them every day, just when I need to. And… oh, I take a little something for my blood pressure, too. A small pink pill. I can't remember the name of it, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed, a stronger pain medication occasionally, and a pink pill for blood pressure. We’ll check your Medicare records to confirm the names and dosages of those medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or insect bites?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes after an insect bite, but nothing serious. No, I can’t think of any allergies. I eat most things, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, Ms. Mayhaugh, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to take a look in your ears and do a quick balance test. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. It’s just… unsettling. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's start with your ears. Please lean forward a little. I’m just looking to see if there’s any wax buildup or signs of infection. Okay… Both ear canals appear clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Now, let's do a quick balance test. I'm going to ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Oh, goodness… I'm a bit unsteady. It's the dizziness, I expect. It feels… worse when I close my eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And that’s perfectly alright – it’s helpful for me to see. You are slightly unsteady, as you said, and closing your eyes does exacerbate the imbalance. Alright, Ms. Mayhaugh, based on what you've told me, and the preliminary exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV for short. It’s a common cause of dizziness, especially with changes in head position. It happens when tiny calcium crystals in your inner ear become dislodged and affect your balance. It’s not serious, and it’s often treatable with a simple maneuver. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a simple hearing test to rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a mouthful! Benign… something? Calcium crystals? It sounds… complicated. But if it’s not serious, that’s a relief. A hearing test sounds alright, yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel steady on my feet again.
DOCTOR: It does sound complicated, and I apologize for the medical jargon. Essentially, it means a little rearrangement in your inner ear is causing the dizziness. The hearing test will just give us a more complete picture and make sure there's nothing else going on. I’ll write you a referral order for that, and you can schedule it at your convenience. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some simple exercises you can do at home to help desensitize your balance. I’ll give you a handout with instructions. And if the dizziness becomes severe or is accompanied by any other symptoms like headaches, vision changes, or trouble speaking, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Exercises, a handout… alright. And yes, if it gets worse, I’ll come back straight away. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s just… unsettling, you know? And my daughter will be pleased to hear it’s not anything too serious. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhaugh. It’s my pleasure, and I completely understand how unsettling this can be. We'll work through this together. Here’s the referral order for the hearing test, and this handout with the exercises. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I'll document everything we discussed today in your chart. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and patience. It’s much appreciated. I think I’ll just get going, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhaugh. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We’ll see you back here after the hearing test. Have a good day!
