DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Nestingen. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It's this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for… well, I'd say a couple weeks now, on and off. Not awful, but persistent, you know? Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A dull ache in the back of the head for a couple of weeks, on and off. Alright. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. It's not like a throbbing pain all day. More like… it'll start, maybe after I’ve been sittin’ for a while, readin’ or workin’ with numbers, and then it'll fade. Sometimes it’s worse in the evenin’. It hasn’t kept me up at night, thankfully. But it's definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Not keeping you up at night is good. And you mentioned working with numbers…do you do that often?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I'm a financial advisor. Been doin’ it for… goodness, over fifty years now. It keeps my mind sharp, but I reckon all that focusin’ can't be good for everything. It's a lot of paperwork, a lot of lookin' at screens. And a lot of helpin' folks sort things out, which I enjoy, but... it does take concentration. You think that could be somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible. Strain on the eyes, neck tension… it can all contribute. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when the headache's bad. Not a lot, just… not as clear as usual. And I’ve been feelin’ kinda tired lately, more tired than I should be, maybe. But I'm eighty-four, Doctor, so what isn't a little tired? I don't know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and fatigue… Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Appetite’s been pretty normal, I think. I still enjoy my food, thankfully! And I haven’t lost any weight. If anything, I could stand to lose a few pounds. But no, nothin’ like that. I’ve always been a pretty skinny fella, though. Always been long and lean. Six-foot-one, and I probably weigh a hundred and thirty pounds, soaking wet.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Not really. I try to stay away from pills if I can. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, 'cause I don't get out in the sun much. And that’s about it. Never been much for medicine. As for allergies... not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife… she was the one with all the sensitivities. Bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just vitamin D. No known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. And then I'll feel your neck and check your neurological function. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. Been gettin’ poked and prodded my whole life. Just let me know if anythin’ feels… well, if it feels odd.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you'll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Please, extend your arm. And I'm noting a blood pressure of 148 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear. Now, let me just feel your neck… Slight tenderness in the posterior neck muscles. Reflexes are normal. Strength is good in all extremities. Finally, let’s check your pupils… Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious neurological deficits.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds… good, I guess. It's all a bit fast, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doin’. Is it somethin’ serious? You're not findin' anythin' worryin', are ya? My daughter would have a fit if I had to go to the hospital again.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gibbel, I'm not detecting anything immediately alarming. However, given your age, the duration of your symptoms – a couple of weeks now – and the tenderness in your neck, along with the occasional blurry vision, I’d like to be cautious. We need to rule out a few possibilities. I recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. And I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan… oh dear. That sounds… serious. I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is it gonna… hurt? And what are you lookin' for exactly? You think I’m havin’ a stroke or somethin'? I feel fine, mostly. Just a headache. Blood work I can handle, I suppose, but a scan… that sounds expensive, too. My insurance… well, I don’t really have insurance anymore.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gibbel, I understand your concerns. A CT scan sounds more frightening than it is. It's a painless imaging test – you'll simply lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. It allows us to visualize your brain and rule out any potential issues that could be causing your headache, such as a small bleed, a tumor, or other structural problems. I'm not saying you’re having a stroke. The scan is simply a precautionary measure, given your age and the persistence of your symptoms. As for the cost… Let me see… The clinic does have a program for patients without insurance. We can work with you to find a payment plan or see if you qualify for financial assistance. The blood work will also be subsidized. It's important to rule out anything serious, and we'll do everything we can to make it affordable. Would you like me to connect you with our financial counselor to discuss your options?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s… good to hear about the financial assistance. I was gettin’ worried about the cost. A payment plan would be helpful. I still don't like the sound of that scan machine, but if you think it's best… alright. If it'll give me peace of mind. Yes, please, connect me with the financial counselor. And… could you maybe explain a little more about what you're lookin' for on the scan? Just so I know what we’re checkin' for, exactly? I like to understand things, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. It's good to be informed. The CT scan primarily allows us to look for any abnormalities within the brain tissue itself – we’ll be checking for tumors, bleeds, or any evidence of stroke. It also allows us to assess the blood vessels to ensure they're not blocked or narrowed. In your case, given your age and symptoms, we’re particularly interested in ruling out a small subdural hematoma – which is a collection of blood between the brain and the skull. It can sometimes occur after a minor head injury, even one you might not remember. It's often benign, but it's important to rule it out. Let me just call our financial counselor, Sarah. She can explain the payment options and any available assistance programs in detail. Sarah?
