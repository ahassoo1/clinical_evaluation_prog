DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 47 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 47. Um… well, I've been thinking a lot lately about… how to be more calm, I guess. I was hoping to talk about mindfulness or meditation. I hear it can help with… everything, really.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness and meditation… I see. While I appreciate you taking a proactive approach to your well-being, Ms. Sugino, this is a primary care office. My expertise lies in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – perhaps anxiety, difficulty sleeping, or persistent worry – that are leading you to explore these options?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand. No, no specific… condition, not really. It’s more… just feeling overwhelmed sometimes. Work is busy, you know? Signal and track switches… it keeps you on your toes! It’s not a bad busy, but… I find myself thinking about things too much, even when I’m not at work. Does that make sense? I just thought maybe this was a good place to start, to learn about ways to… manage it.
DOCTOR: So, you're seeking preventative strategies for stress management, despite not experiencing any diagnosable anxiety or sleep disorder. While I commend your foresight, Ms. Sugino, I am not particularly well-versed in techniques like mindfulness. I wouldn’t want to provide you with inaccurate or insufficient guidance. However, to rule out any underlying medical contributions to these feelings, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. I didn't want to put you on the spot! A typical day… well, I get up around 6:00, usually. Coffee, then I check the schedule. Work is… physical. Lots of walking along the tracks, inspecting things, making repairs. We work in teams, thankfully. It's usually 8-10 hours, depending on the job. Evenings… I try to cook, sometimes. I live alone, so it's just me. I read, watch a little TV… and then I usually can't sleep because my brain won't stop. Does that help? Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Sugino. The insomnia is certainly relevant. Given the physical demands of your work and your reported difficulty sleeping, I’d like to begin with a basic review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – hypertension, diabetes, thyroid issues, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. Regular check-ups, mostly. I have Medicare, so they catch things early if anything’s brewing. My mother had… arthritis, when she was older, but I don’t think that runs in the family, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No surgeries, no serious injuries. Just…tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant medical history, no surgeries. That’s good. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I might take ibuprofen occasionally, if I really ache after work, but that's it. Honestly, I drink a lot of water. That’s my go-to.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, traveled everywhere… never had a reaction. I mean, I don’t love shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. So, no chronic conditions, no medications, no allergies. Now, before we move on, could you please tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I’m… about 161 centimeters. And I weigh around 136 pounds. I try to stay active, with the work and all. It's hard not to, really!
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, while your stated desire is stress management, the insomnia and the feeling of being overwhelmed warrant further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying physical causes for your symptoms. I would like to order a basic blood panel – a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. These will give us a baseline and help determine if there’s anything contributing to how you’re feeling. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If that will help figure things out, absolutely. Vitamin D… I actually haven't had that checked in a while. I work outdoors a lot, but still. So, a blood test, then? Where would I go for that?
DOCTOR: Yes, a blood test. Here’s a list of local labs that are in-network with Medicare. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I would advise you to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on your days off, and try to limit caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, thank you. Regular sleep schedule… I can definitely try that. And I’ll cut back on the coffee. No, I think that’s everything for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I was worried you’d think I was silly, coming in just for… feeling overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: It’s important to address your concerns, Ms. Sugino, regardless of how they may seem. We will get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my nurse provide you with a lab requisition form and instructions before you leave. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. You too! .
