DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let's just get this over with. It’s this… stuff. Coming back up. Food, you know? Especially if I lie down too soon after eating. It's quite unpleasant. And frankly, I haven’t got time for unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Very well. “Stuff coming back up,” as you put it… is this a recent development, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Recent? Well, it’s not new. It’s been going on for… oh, a good few months now, I suppose. But it's getting worse. I used to be able to manage it. Now? Now it happens more often, and it’s… more substantial. I’m a busy man, Dr. Yackey. I don’t have time to be bothered with this.
DOCTOR: “More substantial,” you say. Can you describe what this “stuff” looks like?
PATIENT: Honestly? Do I have to? It's… food. Partially digested food. Sometimes with… liquid. It's not a pleasant image, is it? Look, I eat normal things. Steak, potatoes, a bit of pierogi when my wife makes it. It’s not like I’m eating anything unusual. I just… bring it back up. Is that what you need to know? The color of my regurgitation? Really?
DOCTOR: It is helpful information, Mr. Altine. The color and consistency can indicate several things. But if you are reluctant… have you noticed any blood?
PATIENT: Blood? Heavens, no. Not that I've seen. Though frankly, I don't examine it closely, you understand. I just… deal with it and move on. It's not something one dwells on. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? All this… questioning. It's just indigestion, surely. A bit of heartburn. I’ve always been a hearty eater. Perhaps I need something to… settle my stomach. Something strong. Not these little pink pills my wife keeps offering. They do nothing.
DOCTOR: And besides the regurgitation, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Well, there’s a bit of burning… in my chest, sometimes. After I eat, naturally. And, now that you mention it, my throat feels a little… scratchy. Like something’s… irritated it. But honestly, I've been working hard lately. Probably just tired. A man my age, you know. Things start to… wear down. It's not rocket science, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any difficulty swallowing, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No, not really. Food goes down alright. It’s what happens afterwards that’s the problem. It’s not like I’m choking or anything. It just… comes back. Look, I'm a perfectly healthy man, aside from this… annoyance. I’ve never had problems with my throat before. I eat a good diet, mostly. And I don’t smoke. Don’t ask. My wife would kill me. Can we just get a prescription and be done with this?
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any unintended weight loss recently, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now you're just fishing. Honestly. No. If anything, I've been having trouble keeping the weight off. A man enjoys a good meal, you know? Especially after a long day. It's not like I’m wasting away. I'm a big fella. Always have been. Look, I’m telling you, it’s just indigestion. A strong antacid. That's all I need. Don't start suggesting things are… serious. I haven't got time for serious.
DOCTOR: And what about your appetite, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: My appetite? Excellent! Always excellent. I enjoy my food, as I’ve said. I look forward to my meals. I don't go around picking at things. I eat like a man. Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me? You're asking the strangest questions. It’s just… coming back up. And I want something to stop it. Now. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I see. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination, then. If you’ll just lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: An examination? Really? Look, I haven't got time for poking and prodding. I told you, it's indigestion. Just give me something for heartburn and let me go. I have important things to do, you know. A man my age... I don't need to be lying around on tables. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I will write a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor. But I strongly advise you to return if these symptoms persist or worsen. And, frankly, if you continue to dismiss potential concerns, your health may suffer. I am documenting that you declined a full physical examination. Do you have any allergies to medications?
