DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and…hungry, constantly. It’s quite bothersome, really. I feel like I’m drinking and eating all the time, and it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… constantly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s…difficult to explain. Not like a normal thirst, if that makes sense. It's not like after a salty meal or exercise. It's just…there. And the hunger isn’t tied to a specific time, either. It’s all day. I apologize if that's vague. I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Not very good at describing things?
PATIENT: Oh, I wouldn't say not good, Doctor, just…precise. I work with numbers and manifests, not feelings and sensations. It’s a different skillset entirely. I assure you, I can tell you the exact quantity of bolts in shipment 4B without a second thought. This…is less quantifiable.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, numbers are helpful, but we’ll manage. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been…at least a month, I’d say. Maybe six weeks? It started gradually, just feeling a bit more peckish than usual, and a little more water. Now…it’s quite noticeable. It’s interfering with my work, frankly. I'm constantly getting up.
DOCTOR: A month, six weeks… and has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Same breakfast, same lunch, same…well, you get the idea. I haven't altered my eating habits. I’ve been a bit stressed with work, though. A new inventory system they’ve rolled out is…less than ideal. But I wouldn’t think that would cause this.
DOCTOR: Stress… alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…I suppose I have been going to the lavatory more frequently. And…a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to the stress. It’s hard to say if that’s related or just…life. I don’t know if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination and fatigue… alright. Do you find yourself getting up at night to urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. Perhaps once or twice a night, sometimes not at all. It’s not every night, but it’s enough to disrupt my sleep. It’s…inconvenient, to say the least. I used to sleep like a log.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. And before we move on, do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother…she had some issues with her blood sugar, I believe. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t particularly involved in her medical care, if I’m honest. She passed away several years ago. I don’t know the specifics, unfortunately. My father was as healthy as an ox, though. Never a sick day in his life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had much need for medication, thankfully. A mild reaction to penicillin as a child, but nothing serious. I’ve been fine with everything else the doctors have given me over the years. Mostly just the occasional antibiotic for a cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just standard things – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick abdominal exam. Then I’d like to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I’ve got manifests to process, after all.
DOCTOR: Very good. If you’ll just step over here and have a seat. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, but not terribly concerning on its own. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m noting a slight increase in abdominal girth, but it's not significant. Alright. Now, for the blood work. We'll check your glucose levels, kidney function, and a full metabolic panel. That should give us a good starting point. It’ll take a few hours to get the results back.
PATIENT: That sounds thorough, Doctor. Thank you. A few hours, you say? I should be able to get back to work this afternoon, then? I have a rather large shipment arriving tomorrow that needs…attention.
DOCTOR: Yes, you should be able to get back to work this afternoon. I'll have the lab results faxed to your usual clinic, and my assistant will call you with the results as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. In the meantime, I’d advise you to drink plenty of water, but perhaps avoid sugary drinks. We'll see what the blood work reveals, but it’s always a good idea to stay hydrated. Now, while we wait for the results, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. Never have. My mother was a smoker, and I saw firsthand the effects it had on her. It's not something I ever wanted to do. Dreadful habit.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. A glass of whisky with dinner on a Friday or Saturday, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I'm not a heavy drinker, certainly. More of a social thing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, as I said earlier, it's fairly consistent. Breakfast is usually porridge with a bit of fruit. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe a salad. Dinner is…varied. Usually something simple – fish and vegetables, perhaps. I don't eat a great deal of processed food. I prefer to cook for myself. I suppose I do have a sweet tooth, though. A biscuit with my tea is a small indulgence.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Not as much as I should, Doctor. I walk to work, which is about a mile each way, and I do a bit of gardening on the weekends. But a proper exercise regime? No. I used to play football when I was younger, but…life gets in the way, doesn't it? It's been years. Perhaps I should take it up again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. Thank you for answering my questions. While we await the lab results, I want to be upfront. Your symptoms – increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and a possible sweet tooth – along with the slight elevation in blood pressure, are suggestive of diabetes. Now, I don’t want to jump to conclusions, and the blood work will give us a definitive answer. But it’s best to be prepared. If it is diabetes, it’s manageable with diet, exercise, and medication if necessary. We’ll discuss all your options once we have the results. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh. Good heavens. I… I hadn’t considered that. My mother… she had complications, I recall. It wasn’t pleasant. Is it… serious? And if it is that… what does that mean for me? What sort of changes would I need to make? And will I be able to continue working? That shipment… it’s rather important.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Erxleben. Your mother’s experience is likely coloring your perception, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. Diabetes is a serious condition, but it is very manageable, particularly when caught early, as it appears we are doing. The type of diabetes will determine the exact course of treatment. Type 2, which is more common, often responds well to lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, and weight management. Medication is often necessary, but it’s not a death sentence. As for your work… it shouldn't prevent you from continuing, assuming we manage the condition effectively. It may require some adjustments, but it's certainly possible to live a full and productive life with diabetes. Now, let's focus on getting those lab results back. Once we have them, we’ll discuss a personalized treatment plan. We’ll address the dietary changes, exercise recommendations, and medication options, if needed. And we’ll make sure you’re able to continue working. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions before we wait for the results?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. You've… covered most of it. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, if I'm honest. It’s all rather sudden. The biscuits… would I have to give up the biscuits? That would be… a considerable sacrifice.
DOCTOR: We’ll discuss the biscuits, Mr. Erxleben. A complete restriction isn’t necessarily the first step. We can look at reducing your intake, choosing healthier options, and ensuring it’s part of a balanced diet. It’s about managing your blood sugar levels, not depriving yourself entirely. The key is moderation and making informed choices. We’ll work together to find a sustainable plan that allows you to enjoy life while maintaining your health. Now, my assistant will be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, try to stay calm and focus on getting some rest. If you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms – excessive thirst, blurred vision, confusion – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll talk soon. It was good to meet you, Mr. Erxleben. We’ll get this sorted out.
