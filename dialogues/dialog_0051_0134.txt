DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s good to meet you as well. Seems like just yesterday I was seeing Dr. Henderson… or was it Dr. Miller? Anyway. I’ve been feeling a bit poorly, really. Just… not myself. Mostly sick to my stomach, and I get full awful quick when I do eat something. Doesn’t take much, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be unsettling when there's a change in doctors. Don’t worry about remembering names, Raymonde. We’ll get to the bottom of what's going on. So, you've been feeling unwell, with nausea and getting full quickly when you eat. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that’s a tricky one. Seems like a while now. Maybe… a month or so? It started off just feeling a little queasy now and then, but it’s been getting worse lately. It’s… harder to enjoy my food, that's for sure. And I used to have a good appetite! I always loved to cook for the grandkids when they visited.
DOCTOR: A month… okay. And has anything in particular seemed to trigger it, or does it happen randomly?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I don’t know that anything specific triggers it, not really. I’ve tried to eat the same things I always do… mostly soups and things that are easy on the stomach, you know? My daughter, bless her heart, suggested I eat smaller portions, and that sometimes helps, but not always. It just… happens. Sometimes right after I start eating, sometimes a few hours later. It’s very unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Alright, unpredictable… and it’s not linked to any particular food, or time of day. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea and early fullness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not achingly tired, but just… worn out easier. And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. Nothing drastic, but noticeable. And… now that I think about it, I’ve been feeling a little… bloated sometimes, even when I haven’t eaten much. Is that…normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some weight loss, and bloating alongside the nausea and early fullness. Thank you, Raymonde, that’s very helpful. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well, let me see… everything’s been a bit… irregular, I suppose. Sometimes I feel a little… backed up, and sometimes… well, sometimes it’s the opposite. It’s hard to explain. It hasn't been a big change, just… not my normal routine. I haven't paid much attention to it, to be honest. Old age, I figured.
DOCTOR: I understand, Raymonde. It’s perfectly alright to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be related to what’s going on, so it’s good to be aware of them. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? Well, I had my gallbladder out years and years ago… must’ve been forty years ago now. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Except for my arthritis, of course. It flares up from time to time, mostly in my hands and knees. And… oh! I had a scare with some cancer a few years back, but they got it all, thankfully. It was just in my breast, and they did the surgery and everything. I've been getting check-ups ever since.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Raymonde, that’s very helpful. The cancer history is particularly important, and it’s good to hear you’ve been keeping up with your check-ups. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I take something for my arthritis, a little pill called… naproxen, I think it’s called. And I take a baby aspirin every day, the doctor told me to after a little heart scare a while back. Oh! And sometimes I take something for heartburn, when it gets really bad. Just Tums, usually. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. That’s about it, I think. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis, baby aspirin, Tums as needed, and vitamin D. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with any medication. That’s a blessing, really. Some of my friends are allergic to everything under the sun. No allergies for me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very good to know. Now, Raymonde, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly alright. I don’t mind a bit. I’m used to doctor visits, you know. Go right ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Okay. I do notice some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, and it feels slightly distended. Your heart and lungs sound clear, though. No concerning murmurs or crackles. It's subtle, but it's worth noting. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be related to your gallbladder, even though it was removed years ago. Sometimes scar tissue can cause discomfort. It could also be related to your stomach, or even your intestines. Given your weight loss and the bloating, we should run some tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be alright with drawing some blood and potentially getting an imaging scan, like an ultrasound or a CT scan?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… well, I don’t like tests, but I understand. If it’ll help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, I suppose I’m alright with it. Blood work is fine, I’ve had plenty of that done. An imaging scan… is that going to be uncomfortable? I don’t do well with enclosed spaces, if you know what I mean. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I just… don’t want anything too scary. And how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting, it just makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Raymonde. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood work is straightforward – just a routine sample to check your overall health and rule out any infections. Regarding the imaging scan, an ultrasound doesn't involve any enclosed spaces. You lie on a table and a technician moves a wand over your abdomen. It's painless and non-invasive. If we need a CT scan, it does involve a narrow tunnel, but we can discuss options for managing any anxiety you might have – maybe a mild sedative or even just taking breaks. We won't proceed with the CT scan unless absolutely necessary. The blood results typically come back within a few days. An ultrasound result could be available the same day or the next day. If we do need a CT scan, it could take a bit longer, maybe a week. I'll keep you informed every step of the way and explain everything in detail. Would you like to start with the blood work today?
PATIENT: Yes, let's start with the blood work. That sounds… manageable. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It really puts my mind at ease. Where do we go from here? Do I need to do anything special to prepare for the blood draw? And is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking beforehand? I always worry about doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No worries at all, Raymonde. You haven't done anything wrong. For the blood work, you don't need to do much. Just make sure you've had something to drink this morning, and try not to eat a large meal right before. A light snack is fine, though. I'll write you an order to take to the lab just down the hall. They'll take care of everything there. I’ll also have the nurse check your blood pressure and weight before you leave. Once the results come back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. I just hope everything turns out alright. Is there anything else I need to do or remember before I go?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. It's my job to help. Just take this to the lab, and they'll get you sorted. And remember, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all before your follow-up appointment. For now, just focus on taking care of yourself. And honestly, try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. The nurse will be with you shortly to check your weight and blood pressure, then you can head to the lab. Is there anything I can do for you before you head out?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been wonderful. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes or you have any questions. .
