DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my foot. This…sore. Been bothering me for weeks now. Honestly, I don't know why it’s taking so long to heal. I’ve always been a very…healthy woman, you see. Not like some people.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. Since…let me think…right after my grandson left for college. August 15th, I believe. A rather disappointing young man, if you ask me, but that's neither here nor there. The point is, this foot hasn’t gotten any better, and it's painful. Really painful when I try to put any weight on it. I used to walk everywhere, you know. Everywhere.
DOCTOR: And where exactly on your foot is the pain?
PATIENT: Right here, on the bottom. It’s…well, it’s a hole, practically. Not a large hole, mind you, but noticeable. And red. Very red. I've tried putting ointment on it, but it doesn’t seem to do a thing. Honestly, the young people at the pharmacy didn't seem to know what they were talking about.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what sort of ointment did they recommend?
PATIENT: Oh, some…fancy cream. With vitamins in it, they said. Smelled like coconuts, if you can believe it. A waste of good money, if you ask me. I prefer a simple antiseptic, like they used back in my day. All this newfangled stuff...it's just not reliable. And it certainly hasn't helped my foot! I've always had good skin, you know. Never had trouble like this before.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look at it, shall we?
PATIENT: Be gentle, dear. It’s quite sensitive. And try not to make a fuss. I don't like a lot of…fuss.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. It does appear to be an ulcer. And it’s…quite inflamed. How is your circulation generally?
PATIENT: Inflamed? Good heavens. I told you it was painful! As for circulation…well, my ankles do swell a bit at the end of the day. But that’s just from standing, you know. I used to be a dancer, you see. Years and years of dancing. My legs have always been strong. Though, now……not what they used to be. I don’t get out much anymore.
DOCTOR: And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years ago I was…“pre-diabetic,” or something like that. But I don’t believe in all that. I eat perfectly healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. And I certainly don’t drink sugary drinks! It’s probably just a little…old age, that’s all. I've always been strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…sometimes, yes. In my toes, mostly. But it comes and goes. Probably just from sitting too long. I used to be very active, you see. Always moving. It’s hard to explain. And I don’t like complaining, dear. I've always been a stoic woman.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Back in my day, you didn’t worry about allergies. You took what the doctor gave you and got on with it. Now everyone is so…sensitive. No, I have no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to check your pulses in your feet and legs. It’s just a quick examination to assess your circulation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. But don’t poke around too much. I don’t like being fussed over. And be gentle! I have delicate veins. Honestly, all this…probing. It's unnecessary, if you ask me. But alright, go ahead. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your pulses on your left foot are a little weaker than on your right, and there's some mild swelling. Given the ulcer, the weak pulses, and the numbness you've been experiencing, I'm concerned about potential poor circulation. It could be related to peripheral artery disease. It’s important to get this investigated.
PATIENT: Peripheral artery what now? Good heavens, what are you talking about? Poor circulation? I just told you I used to be a dancer! And I don't have any trouble with my circulation. You're trying to tell me something is wrong with me? I think you’re being alarmist, dear. Honestly, all these young doctors…always looking for something to be wrong. I'll be just fine. A little ointment, that’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your skepticism, but it's important to rule out any serious underlying conditions. Poor circulation can lead to slow healing, and in severe cases, even infection. I recommend a vascular ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. It's a painless test, and it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. If we determine there is a problem with circulation, we can discuss treatment options, which may include medication or lifestyle changes. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Lifestyle changes? Honestly! You're treating me like I'm some frail old woman! I’ve lived a full and active life, and I don't need your fancy tests and…and changes! I eat perfectly well, I get enough rest, and I’ve always been strong. I think you’re wasting my time, dear. And frankly, you’re starting to irritate me. I came in here for a little ointment, not a whole medical investigation. I think I'll just go home and take care of it myself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. However, if the ulcer worsens, or you experience any signs of infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or drainage – please come back immediately, or go to the emergency room. Here's a prescription for a topical antibiotic ointment. Please use it as directed. I also recommend elevating your foot whenever possible and avoiding putting excessive weight on it. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Ointment, elevation, don't put weight on it. Honestly, all things I already know. I've been taking care of myself for eighty-nine years, thank you very much. I don’t need a doctor to tell me how to live my life. I think I've wasted enough time here. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take care, Ms. Cannington. And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. .
