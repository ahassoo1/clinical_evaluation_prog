DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's... muscle weakness, mostly. It's been getting worse lately, and I figured I should get it checked out before it gets too bad.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Muscle weakness is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Okay. Um... it started, I guess, maybe a month ago? Just feeling a little tired after normal stuff. But now... well, it's like it takes a lot more effort to do things. Like, getting out of a chair. Or carrying groceries. Nothing major, but noticeable. Mostly in my legs, I think. Though sometimes my arms feel it too. It's hard to explain, it's not pain, just... heavy.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it began gradually about a month ago with increased fatigue, and has progressed to noticeable difficulty with activities like rising from a chair and carrying objects. You’ve noticed it primarily in your legs, but occasionally in your arms as well, describing the sensation as “heavy” rather than painful. To get a clearer picture, could you describe how it feels heavy?
PATIENT: It's... not like a weight is on them. More like... it takes a lot more effort to move them. Like there's resistance. You know when you've worked out really hard and your muscles feel drained? It’s… similar, but I haven’t been doing any heavy lifting or anything. It just feels like they're working extra hard all the time, even when they shouldn't be. Does that make sense? It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. You’re describing a sensation of increased effort with movement, similar to muscle fatigue after strenuous exercise, but without a corresponding level of activity. That's helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of the scope of this, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No real pain, like I said. No numbness or tingling. I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, just generally run down. And… this might be nothing, but I've been a little clumsy lately. Dropped things a couple of times. Not a lot, but more than usual. No fever, no dizziness. Just… tired and weak, and a bit more likely to fumble things. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. So, in addition to the weakness and fatigue, you've noticed increased clumsiness, with a tendency to drop things. No pain, numbness, tingling, fever, or dizziness. Now, let's delve into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had the flu a couple of times, usual stuff. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed fine. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. This is… new. I don’t even have a regular doctor, usually just go to urgent care if I need something. That’s why I haven't been checked out before now. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear. No prior diagnoses, no surgeries, and a history of generally good health. You've only sought medical care for acute illnesses like the flu and a childhood broken arm. And, if you don’t mind me asking, is there any family history of muscle weakness, neurological conditions, or similar symptoms?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My… my father had some problems with his balance when he got older, but I don't know what it was exactly. Something with his nerves, maybe? He lived back in Yemen, so it was hard to get clear information. My mother was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in her life. No one else that I can think of had anything like this. It wasn't really a topic of conversation, you know? We didn’t really talk about medical stuff much. Sorry, I’m not much help on that one.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. McKinnon. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. A history of balance problems in your father is noted. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m an insurance appraiser, mostly auto damage. So I’m on my feet a lot, walking around looking at cars, taking pictures. It’s not heavy work, but it keeps me moving. I live alone. I try to eat healthy, but… sometimes it's easier to grab something quick. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. I don't do a lot of exercise, I should probably be more active. I get enough sleep, usually. I try to avoid stress as much as possible, but the job can be stressful sometimes. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, you work as an insurance appraiser, which involves being on your feet and some physical activity. You have a relatively healthy lifestyle, with no smoking or excessive alcohol consumption, and you generally get adequate sleep. You acknowledge room for improvement in terms of regular exercise. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't really take anything. Maybe an aspirin if I have a headache, but that's about it. No regular prescriptions, no vitamins, no supplements. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Is that… is that a problem? Should I be taking something? I just want to get to the bottom of what's going on.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a problem at all. It’s good to know you aren’t currently taking any medications. Okay, Mr. McKinnon, thank you for providing such a detailed history. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to assess your strength, reflexes, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need to do. Let's get this figured out. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Hopefully we can find out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you don’t mind, please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. I’m going to gently push down on your arms and ask you to resist the pressure. Your reflexes are normal, and your arm strength appears good. However, I am noting mild weakness in both of your legs, especially when lifting your feet upwards. Your gait is slightly unsteady. I also note reduced dorsiflexion strength in both feet. These findings are consistent with possible lower extremity weakness. I'd like to order some lab work to investigate this further. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. We will also order a creatine kinase level to assess for muscle damage. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever tests you think are necessary, let's do them. I just want to know what's going on and, if possible, get this fixed. Vitamin D, creatine... whatever you need. I don't understand what they are, but I trust your judgement. Just let me know what I need to do to get them done. Is there anything I should avoid before the tests? Like, certain foods or activities? I want to make sure we get accurate results.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. McKinnon. Thank you for your cooperation. The tests I’ve ordered will help us assess for a variety of potential causes of your weakness, including vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid problems, and muscle damage. Regarding preparation, for the blood work, I recommend avoiding strenuous exercise for 24 hours before the test. You can eat and drink normally, unless you are specifically instructed otherwise by the lab. If you are taking any supplements, please inform the lab technician, as some supplements can interfere with the results. I will provide you with a lab requisition form. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, and they are open from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. You do not need an appointment. Once the results are back – usually within 3-5 business days – we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your weakness worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as pain, numbness, tingling, or difficulty breathing, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. 3-5 business days, 123 Main Street, no appointment needed. I’ll try to avoid strenuous exercise. And if things get worse, I’ll call. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out what's going on. It's been worrying me a lot. I hope it's nothing too serious. I think that's all. I'll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I understand your concern, and we will do everything we can to determine the cause of your weakness and get you back to feeling your best. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here is the form. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
