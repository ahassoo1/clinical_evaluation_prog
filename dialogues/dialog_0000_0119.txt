DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick, welcome. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It’s… a problem with my… husband. Or, rather, would-be husband. It’s a delicate situation. He’s… discharging something. And it's not… normal.
DOCTOR: "Discharging," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, discharging. Honestly, it's quite unseemly. It's… well, it's coming from him, down there. And it's not… clear. It's… yellowish, I’d say. And there's an… odor. Not a pleasant one, I assure you. He's quite distressed, naturally. I'm worried it might be… something awful. Though, frankly, I don't understand how a man can simply have such things. One would think… cleanliness would prevent it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I understand this is… uncomfortable for you to discuss, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. It’s good you’re seeking medical advice. While I understand your… concerns about cleanliness, these things do happen, regardless. Now, let’s get some details. When did you first notice this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… It’s been… a week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It started after… a particularly… enthusiastic evening. He's not a young man, you see. Though he thinks he is. He's been… rather proud of his… renewed vigor lately, but now this. It’s a bit of a letdown, frankly. It wasn’t immediate, mind you, it developed… gradually. He didn’t mention it at first, of course. Men are dreadful at noticing such things.
DOCTOR: "Renewed vigor," you say. And it developed gradually over the week following this… evening. Is he experiencing any pain, burning, or itching along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, now that you mention it… he has been complaining of a bit of discomfort. Not a sharp pain, exactly, more of a… burning sensation, he says. Especially… afterwards. And he's been… fidgeting, quite a lot, and scratching. Not constantly, but… noticeably. He also seems rather… subdued. Which, for him, is quite unusual. He's normally a very… boisterous individual. Though I suspect that might be embarrassment more than anything.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation, especially after… activity. And fidgeting, scratching, and a change in his usual demeanor. Has he noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven't taken his temperature, honestly. He’d likely protest. He doesn’t much care for doctors, you see. And chills… no, not that I’ve noticed. He’s been a bit… warm in the evenings, perhaps, but that’s the weather, isn’t it? It's terribly humid here. Lower abdominal pain… no, he hasn’t mentioned anything like that. He would complain, I think, if he was in pain. He’s not one to suffer in silence. Honestly, Doctor, it all seems rather… unsavory. I just want him fixed. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: "Fixed" is not always possible, Ms. Wartick. But we can certainly investigate. Based on what you've described – the discharge, burning sensation, and change in demeanor – it could be a number of things. Most commonly, it suggests a possible infection. A sexually transmitted infection, perhaps, or something else. To be certain, we'll need to conduct a physical exam, and I’ll need to take a sample. I understand this is… delicate, but it’s necessary for proper diagnosis. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A sample? Well… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. But must I be present? Surely, you’ve seen… such things before. It’s terribly awkward, you understand. He’s a bit… self-conscious, to say the least. And frankly, so am I. It's just… undignified. Can't you just prescribe something? Perhaps an ointment? A strong antibiotic? I really don't think a physical examination is necessary. It all seems terribly invasive.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your discomfort, truly. However, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible, and potentially harmful. We need to identify the cause of the infection before we can determine the appropriate treatment. And yes, I have seen such things before – it’s part of my job. Now, while I strongly recommend he allow me to conduct a physical exam, I can certainly speak to him privately and explain the necessity of it. Would you prefer I do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… preferable. Please, speak to him privately. He's quite easily embarrassed, you see. He'll likely protest, but I trust your professional judgment. Just… explain it gently. And perhaps… emphasize the importance of… discretion? He wouldn't want the neighbors to find out, you understand. They gossip terribly around here. And… could you assure him it won’t take long? He has a gardening club meeting this afternoon. This is all very unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I will speak with him privately, and I assure you, I will be as discreet and efficient as possible. I will explain the necessity of the exam and reassure him about confidentiality. Please, remain here while I attend to him. I will return shortly to discuss our next steps. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask.
