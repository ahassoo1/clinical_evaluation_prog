DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bohnett, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lindsey Bohnett. Though most folks just call me Lindy. It’s good to meet you, Doctor… Osga, is it?
DOCTOR: Osga is fine. Look, I’m rather busy today, so let’s just get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, dear. No problem at all. I understand. Busy doctors are good doctors, I always say. So, what’s this about my cholesterol being high? I feel alright, mostly. A little stiff in the mornings, but that's just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: “Feel alright.” Right. Well, “feeling alright” and being alright are often…different things. The numbers don’t lie. And 88 is…well, let's just say you’ve had a good run. Now, when did you last have a cholesterol check before this one?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… It must have been… oh, goodness. Probably five, maybe six years ago? It was right after Martha – my wife – passed, I believe. There was a lot going on then, and I don't recall the details very well. They just told me everything looked okay, and I didn’t press for numbers. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Five or six years… Honestly, Mr. Bohnett, that’s…less than ideal. And “looked okay” is not a medical assessment. Do you recall who did this check six years ago?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no, I don’t rightly remember. Some doctor at the hospital, I suppose. It was just a routine thing after Martha… everything was a blur, you understand. There were so many appointments. They all sort of blend together after a while. Is it important who it was? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful to have a baseline, but… never mind. Let’s focus on now. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Nothing at all. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for my joints, but that's it. I've always been a healthy eater, you know. Lots of fish, vegetables from the garden… Martha always made sure of that. Though, I do enjoy a good piece of pie when my granddaughter visits. She makes a wonderful apple one.
DOCTOR: Pie. Right. And you said you've been feeling alright?
PATIENT: Well, mostly alright. Like I said, a bit stiff in the mornings, and I get tired easier than I used to. But I figure that’s just part of getting older. Nothing that stops me from doing what I want, though. I still tend to my garden, visit with friends… I try to stay active. Is the tiredness something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: "Try to stay active" at 88… commendable, I suppose. The tiredness… could be a lot of things. Frankly, at your age, it could be anything. Do you have any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… my father, he had a bit of trouble with his heart later in life. He had to take pills, and he wasn't very active. It wasn’t a good ending, I remember that. My mother, she was as healthy as a horse, though. Lived to be 95, she did. Always said a good laugh was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some family history there. And you mentioned stiffness… where exactly are you feeling stiff?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees and my lower back. It's worse in the mornings, like I said, and after I've been sitting for a while. Gets a little easier when I start moving around, but it’s always there, a dull ache mostly. It’s not crippling, mind you, but it’s… noticeable. I used to be able to bend over and pull weeds without a thought, but that’s getting harder each year.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's have a look. If you don't mind. Just need to get you on the examination table. We'll do a quick physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think best, Doctor. I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Getting up and down isn't quite as easy as it used to be, you know. But I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: Just get up there, Mr. Bohnett. I'll assist if necessary. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little tender, yes, when you press right there. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It’s been getting worse slowly over the last year or so. It doesn't swell or anything, just aches. Used to be I could walk for miles, but now I have to take a few breaks. Ow, yes, right there. That’s a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That's where I feel it most. A dull ache, like a constant pressure. It’s worse when I bend over, of course, but even just sitting for too long will set it off. Feels like something’s pinched, maybe? I don’t know much about these things, mind you. It’s just old age, I suppose. Though, Martha always said I shouldn’t ignore my aches and pains. She was a sensible woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, "just old age" doesn’t rule out anything. We'll need to get some blood work done, a more detailed cholesterol panel. And I'm going to order some X-rays of your knees and lower back. Just to see what’s going on.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think it's best. I trust your judgement. Will the blood work take long? And are the X-rays… unpleasant? I haven’t had those done in years, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: The blood work is routine. A few vials, that's all. The X-rays are painless, just stand still for a moment. The tech will explain everything. I'll have the results sent to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here. Take these to the lab and radiology. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't believe so. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take anything… well, mostly anything. Martha used to say I had an iron stomach. Right, the lab and radiology… I think they’re down the hall, aren’t they? I sometimes get a little turned around in these places.
DOCTOR: Yes, down the hall. Front desk can point you in the right direction if you get lost. Look, I have other patients waiting. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. We’ll discuss the results then. You can get changed now.
PATIENT: Right, yes, of course. I won’t keep you. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I appreciate your time. I’ll go find the lab now. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any special preparations for the blood work? .
