DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… something down there. It's… leaking. Not a good leak, you know? Been happening a little while now. I don’t know what it is, but it's messy.
DOCTOR: "Down there"... could you be a bit more specific, please?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. It’s… the man part. You know. Where a man… well, you’re the doctor! It's coming from there. It’s… icky. And it smells a little funny, too. Not like flowers, that's for sure. I haven't been with anyone for a long, long time, so I don't know what it could be.
DOCTOR: Right. So, discharge from the vagina, and you say it has an odor. And you haven't had any sexual activity recently. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Vagina? Oh. Well, it feels like that area. I guess. Time… goodness, that’s hard. Maybe a month? Could be longer. I don’t really keep track of things like that. It wasn't bad at first, just a little damp, but now it’s… more noticeable. It stains my underwear sometimes. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Contributing? Oh, I don’t know. I’ve been eating the same things. Sleeping in the same bed. Same everything, really. Maybe the weather? It's been awfully humid lately. Everything feels sticky. Does that have something to do with it? I haven’t fallen or anything. And I don’t use any of those… douches or anything like that. Never did.
DOCTOR: Humid weather doesn't generally cause vaginal discharge, Mrs. Genard. But we'll get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… a little itchy sometimes. Not all the time, just… off and on. And a little sore, maybe. But I'm old! Everything aches, you know? It's hard to tell what's from the… problem and what's just being old. It doesn't burn, not exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It’s mostly just the mess, really. It's very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unusual vaginal odor before, or is this a new occurrence?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never. I mean, it smells… different. Not like a rose, definitely not. Kind of… fishy, maybe? But I don't eat much fish these days. It's just… not right. I always kept myself clean, you know? So this is… surprising. It’s just awful, really. Makes me feel… dirty.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you may have a case of bacterial vaginosis, or possibly a yeast infection. It’s quite common, especially as we get older. We’ll need to take a look to be certain. Would you mind if I perform a quick pelvic exam?
PATIENT: A… exam? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. Do you have to? I mean, I'm an old lady. Everything’s… delicate, you know? Is there anything else you can do? A test, maybe? I don’t like people poking around… down there. It’s very private. And… embarrassing. I just want it to stop, you know? Not be poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, a physical exam is the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. While we can sometimes make a diagnosis based on your description, it’s not reliable. And frankly, leaving this untreated could lead to complications. It’s a quick exam, and I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. We need to rule out anything serious. I understand your discomfort, but it’s necessary. If you absolutely refuse, I can prescribe a general antibiotic, but it may not be the right treatment, and the problem could persist. I strongly recommend the exam.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Complications? Now you're scaring me. I don't want any complications. But… poking around? I really don’t like the sound of that. Are you sure it will be quick? And gentle? Promise? I’m… I suppose if it's the only way to make sure nothing serious is wrong… but you have to be very careful. And explain everything first. I don’t like surprises. This is just… awful. Just awful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Genard, I promise it will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will explain everything step-by-step before I do it. We’ll start with a visual inspection, and then I’ll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can take a look. It may feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll take a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis. Then, we’ll be done. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A speculum? What is that? Sounds… scary. And a sample? You mean… like a little bit of the… mess? Oh, dear. This is all so… invasive. Is it going to hurt? Really hurt? I’ve never had anything like this done before. And what if you find something… bad? I don't want to hear about anything bad. I just want it to go away. Can’t you just give me something to make it stop? A cream, maybe? Before all this poking and prodding? Please?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, a speculum is a small instrument we use to gently open the vaginal canal so we can see what’s going on. It’s standard procedure. And while a cream might provide temporary relief, it won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms. We need to know what we’re dealing with before we can prescribe the appropriate treatment. Look, I understand your anxiety, but refusing a proper examination is simply not in your best interest. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will explain every step of the process. If you continue to refuse, I'm afraid there's not much more I can do for you today. Do you want me to proceed, or would you like me to write a referral to another doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Another doctor? I don't want to go to another doctor! That's more poking and prodding with someone I don’t know. You're the doctor here. And you promise it won’t hurt… too much? And you’ll tell me everything first? I suppose… I suppose if you promise. But go slowly. And explain every single thing. And if it hurts… really hurts… I want you to stop. Okay? And don’t be surprised if I ask a lot of questions. I get… nervous. Just… slowly, okay? Very slowly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Genard. Slowly, and I will explain everything. First, we’ll have you lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. Then, I’ll gently drape a sheet over you to maintain your privacy. I'll use a lubricated speculum and slowly insert it into your vagina. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any significant discomfort, please let me know immediately, and I will stop. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lie on my back? That’s… awkward. I haven’t done that in ages. And a sheet? That won’t hide much. Okay… I suppose. But promise you’ll be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing as you're doing it. Don't just… poke. Explain. Everything. And if it hurts, stop. I mean it. Okay… I guess I’m ready. But go slowly… very, very slowly. This is… scary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Lie back, please. We’ll get started. First, I'm just going to position you comfortably and drape the sheet over you to ensure your privacy. I will tell you what I am doing every step of the way. Now, I'm applying a small amount of lubricant to the speculum. This will make it easier and more comfortable for insertion. Do you feel alright so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The lubricant is… cold. And wet. I don’t like wet things. Okay… I’m still okay. But I'm nervous. Very nervous. And what is that smell? Is that… your smell? It’s not a very nice smell. But I’m still okay. Just… keep talking. Tell me what you’re doing. Don’t just… do things. Okay… I’m still okay. But I don’t like this. Not one bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m very gently inserting the speculum into your vagina. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Just breathe deeply and try to relax. We’re only going in a short distance… just enough to get a good look. Do you feel any discomfort at all?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear! That is cold! And… and… it’s stretching! It’s… uncomfortable! Very uncomfortable! Stop! No, no, no, stop! It feels… wrong! It’s too cold and too… stretched! I don't like it! Stop now, please! This is too much! I told you, I don’t like this! Stop!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, Mrs. Genard. I've stopped. I’m so sorry. You’re right, it’s clearly not working. I apologize for causing you discomfort. It appears a pelvic exam is not something you’re comfortable with at this time. Given your anxiety and discomfort, I can prescribe a general antibiotic to treat a possible bacterial vaginosis. However, it’s important to understand that this is not a definitive diagnosis, and the treatment may not be effective if the cause of your symptoms is something else. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss other options, but I will respect your decision if you do not wish to proceed with further examination. Do you want me to write a prescription for the antibiotic?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Thank you. Thank you so much. A prescription… yes, please. Anything to make it stop. I don't want any more poking and prodding. Just… something to make it go away. A prescription… yes, that would be wonderful. Thank you, doctor. You’re very kind. Just… something to make it stop. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I’ve just sent a prescription for Metronidazole to your pharmacy. It’s a course of seven days. Take it as directed, even if your symptoms improve before you finish the medication. It’s important to complete the full course to ensure the infection is completely eradicated. Here’s a sheet with detailed instructions on how to take the medication and what to expect. It also lists potential side effects, although most people tolerate it well. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, please contact the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. And remember, I respect your decision not to proceed with further examination at this time. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Seven days… I can remember that. And side effects? Oh dear. I don't need any more problems. I’ll… I’ll try to remember everything. Thank you, doctor. You've been very patient. No, I don't think I have any more questions. Just… something to make it stop. I just want it to stop. Thank you again. I think… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, you’re welcome, Mrs. Genard. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. The nurse will escort you out. Have a good day.
