DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 52 years old. Could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 52, though I feel much older some days. Honestly, it’s my eyes. They’re just…not what they used to be. Things are getting blurry, especially up close. It’s rather inconvenient, if I’m being frank. I suppose that’s what prompted this visit.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, particularly up close… alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand. More of a…gradual decline. Probably the last six months or so I’ve really noticed it. Before that, I just chalked it up to fatigue, or poor lighting. One does get older, after all. But it's become…problematic.
DOCTOR: Six months… and has it been worsening steadily, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate… hmm. I suppose it’s worse when I’m tired, definitely. And if I’ve been reading for a while. But it hasn’t been a dramatic change day to day, if that makes any sense. More like… a slow, inexorable drift towards… less clarity. It’s rather frustrating, actually. A man needs to be able to see things properly, you know? Especially important documents.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. And yes, clear vision is certainly important. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. Never have. My eyesight was always quite good, you see. Perfectly adequate. It's just… lately, it hasn’t been. I always thought needing glasses was a sign of… weakness, perhaps. A failing of the body. Though I’m beginning to think I was rather foolish to hold such a view.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Well, needing glasses is hardly a sign of weakness, Mr. Alcorta. It’s a very common issue as we age. Alright. I’d like to do a quick visual exam, if you don’t mind. It will involve reading some letters on a chart, and I’ll check your peripheral vision as well. Just a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I haven’t the faintest idea what “peripheral vision” entails. I suppose if you say it’s necessary, I’ll cooperate. I do hope it won’t take too long. I have several rather pressing matters to attend to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It won’t take long at all, Mr. Alcorta. Peripheral vision simply means your side vision – how well you see things out of the corners of your eyes. It helps us understand if there are any blind spots. If you’ll just stand about ten feet from the chart, and cover your left eye with your hand, we can begin. Please read the smallest line you can clearly see.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is… rather small print. I can make out the larger letters, certainly. But the smaller ones are just a blur. I suppose that’s rather the point, isn’t it? Though I do wish they weren’t so…dimly lit. Is this chart properly illuminated?
DOCTOR: The lighting was a bit low. Alright, let's try that again. Just read the smallest line you can see, even if it’s not perfectly clear. Don’t strain your eyes. And please, let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Well… I can barely discern the top few letters of the second line from the bottom. But it's…a real struggle. And frankly, I find this entire process rather undignified. I’m accustomed to giving instructions, Doctor, not being subjected to them. It’s… unsettling. Are you certain this is the most efficient way to determine the state of my eyesight? Perhaps a more… sophisticated device would be preferable?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, with all due respect, this is a standard visual acuity test. It provides a baseline measurement. We can certainly discuss more advanced testing, but this initial assessment is necessary. Alright. Now, let's cover your right eye, and repeat the process. It’s important to assess both eyes independently.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But I must say, I find this whole endeavor… rather inefficient. And the lack of comfortable seating is a distinct oversight. The larger letters are still manageable, naturally. But the smaller ones… utterly indistinguishable. It's quite a strain, really. I hope this will be sufficient for you to determine the… obvious. It's rather clear my eyesight is deteriorating, is it not? Is there anything else you require of me? Because frankly, my patience is wearing thin.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I am documenting your responses to ensure a thorough and accurate record of your examination. Your subjective experience is important, but it must be combined with objective measurements. Based on your responses, it appears you are experiencing age-related farsightedness, also known as presbyopia. It's a very common condition that affects nearly everyone as they age. However, to determine the precise degree of correction you require, and to rule out any other underlying issues, I recommend a comprehensive eye exam with an optometrist. They can perform a more detailed refraction and assess the overall health of your eyes. Do you have a regular optometrist?
PATIENT: An optometrist, you say? No, Doctor. I’ve never felt the need for such a specialist. I’ve always managed perfectly well on my own. And frankly, the very idea of someone poking and prodding at my eyes… it’s rather unsettling. However, if you insist… I suppose I could be persuaded. But I must warn you, I have a rather demanding schedule. And I expect a prompt and efficient service. I do not have time for frivolous examinations or unnecessary procedures. Do you have any recommendations? And preferably someone with a…discreet and professional demeanor. I wouldn’t want to be subjected to undue scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have a list of local optometrists. Dr. Eleanor Vance has a good reputation for thoroughness and efficiency. She is located on Elm Street, and her number is 555-1234. She does accept walk-in appointments, but I would recommend calling ahead to schedule. Here is a referral slip, as well as her contact information. I also recommend scheduling a general physical with a primary care physician, if you haven't had one recently. It's important to have a baseline assessment of your overall health. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Elm Street, you say? Hmph. Very well. I shall add it to my list of… obligations. A general physical… frankly, Doctor, I find that suggestion rather unnecessary. I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate. I maintain a rigorous lifestyle and adhere to a strict regimen. However, I appreciate your… concern. No, I believe that is all. I trust this consultation has been adequately documented, and that I will not be subjected to any further…prodding. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. I have documented everything. I wish you good health. .
