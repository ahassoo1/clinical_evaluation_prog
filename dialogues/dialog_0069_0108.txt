DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, I ain't one for small talk. It's my stomach. Been bleedin'. Not a pretty sight, I can tell you that much. Happened a couple times now. Just... popped up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. Bleeding is definitely something we need to take seriously. When you say "popped up," can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Like… it just started. No warning, no nothin’. One minute I'm fine, next I'm… well, you get the picture. It's not a little trickle, either. It’s… substantial. And it smells awful. Honestly, I'm surprised I even bothered comin' in. Most doctors these days… don't seem to know much anyway. Just want to push pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and frustration, Mr. Gentz, and I assure you I’m here to listen and figure out what’s going on. It's good you came in. "Substantial" is helpful to know, and the smell can give us some clues as well. Can you describe what the blood looks like?
PATIENT: Looks like… coffee grounds, mostly. Dark, kinda grainy. And sometimes there’s… well, bits in it. You don't wanna know. Happened twice in the last week. First time, I thought it was somethin' I ate. But then it happened again this mornin'. Worse than before. I'm losin' my appetite, too. Everything just tastes… off. It’s not like I'm eatin' anything fancy, just basic stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee grounds… that's important information. And the fact that it’s happened twice, and is getting worse, is definitely concerning. Losing your appetite is also something we need to consider. Mr. Gentz, do you have any pain in your stomach, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Nah, no real pain. Maybe a little discomfort, kinda like… a dull ache. But nothin' I'd bother a doctor about usually. It’s more… unsettling, you know? Just feelin’ weak and… empty. And tired. Real tired. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I’m pooped after a couple hours. It’s ridiculous. Plus, my wife… she woulda had me to the hospital by now if she was still around. She knew when somethin’ was wrong. I miss her.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gentz. It’s understandable that you miss her, and it sounds like she was a good advocate for your health. Okay, so no significant pain, just discomfort, weakness, and fatigue. Have you noticed any other changes in your bowel movements besides the bleeding?
PATIENT: Well... they’re darker than usual, of course. Black. Like tar. And kinda…sticky. Hard to get rid of, if you catch my drift. Not as… solid as they used to be either. More… mushy. I ain’t been payin’ a whole lot of attention, to be honest. Never had trouble with my stomach before. Just a simple man, Doc, leadin' a simple life. Now this. Honestly, it probably ain’t nothin'. Just old age catchin' up to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, black, tarry stools are very important information, Mr. Gentz. That, along with the coffee ground appearance of the vomit and the bleeding, suggests this is more than just “old age.” To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’m going to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like ulcers, Crohn’s disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’. Always been healthy as a horse. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s it. I don’t go to doctors. Waste of time and money, mostly. My wife… she always made me go for checkups. Said I needed ‘em. I always complained. She was a worrier, bless her heart. I take after my father, strong constitution, that's what he always said. Never been sick a day in my life 'til now. I’ve always been able to handle things myself. Besides, what's a doctor gonna do? Give me another pill? I’m tellin' ya, Doc, it’s probably just somethin’ I ate. A bad batch of dates, maybe.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Gentz. It’s helpful to know about your family history and your general health. Even if you’ve been healthy in the past, it’s important to investigate what’s happening now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbed a tree, fell outta it. That's about it. Never needed to be cut open or nothin'. I work with… well, let’s just say I work with people who end up needing that kinda thing. It’s not a pretty job. Makes ya appreciate bein’ alive, that’s for sure. But me? Never had a serious injury or sickness, 'til now. This bleedin'… it's really worryin' me, despite what I say. It's just… hard to admit I might be sick. Makes me feel weak.
DOCTOR: I understand that feeling, Mr. Gentz. It’s completely natural to feel that way. It takes courage to come in and get checked out, and you’re doing the right thing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’. I don’t believe in all that fancy medicine. Give me a strong cup of tea and a good night's sleep, that’s all I need. Maybe some dates. But that's it. I used to take somethin’ for my knees, a few years back, but it didn’t do nothin’ so I stopped. I don’t like feelin’ drugged up. Makes me foggy. Besides, my wife always handled the pills. I just… took what she gave me. Now that she's gone... I just don't bother. Honestly, Doc, I'm probably just stressed out. Work's been busy. But bleedin'? That’s somethin’ new. And it scares me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current medications, and you stopped taking something for your knees a while ago. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to nothin'. Not even poison ivy. Tough as nails, that's what my father always said. Always worked outdoors, never coddled. Honestly, Doc, I'm startin' to think you're just askin' questions to fill up time. What's a doctor gonna do anyway? Push a pill? I'm tellin' ya, this bleedin’… it's probably just a one-time thing. Stress, maybe. I'll go home, get some rest, and it'll be gone tomorrow. But if it keeps happenin’… I don’t know what I'll do. This is really worryin’ me. And I don’t like worryin’. Makes my stomach hurt even more.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. I’m asking these questions because they’re important for getting a complete picture of your health and ruling out possible causes. It's not about filling up time, it's about making sure we don't miss anything. Okay, so no known allergies. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. It’s pretty standard, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll need to examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. But don't expect much. I'm a simple man, Doc. Not much to see here. Just a few aches and pains, and now this bleedin'. Honestly, I’m startin’ to feel like a bother. And I don’t like feelin’ like a bother. Get it over with, Doc. The quicker we get this done, the quicker I can go home and try to forget about it. Just… be gentle, alright? This stomach… it's sensitive. And try not to poke too much. You don’t know what I’ve seen. Makes a fella squeamish, even me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I understand your sensitivity. I promise to be thorough but respectful. Alright, if you could lie back for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is a little tender, especially up here… …and it feels a bit swollen. You’re understandably a little tense, but there's some guarding here as well, which suggests some inflammation. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah. It’s… uncomfortable. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Like somethin’s pushin’ from the inside. Feels worse when you press on it, though. Like you’re stirrin’ somethin’ up. Honestly, Doc, it’s makin’ me nervous. This don’t feel right. Never felt nothin’ like this before. I’m tellin’ ya, somethin’s wrong. Really wrong. And I don’t like it. Not one bit. What do you think it is? Just tell me straight, Doc. I ain't one for sugarcoatin'. What's goin' on inside me?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand your concern. It's good you’re being honest about how you’re feeling. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m finding on the exam—the tenderness, the distention, the guarding, and the coffee ground emesis and tarry stools—I'm concerned about a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. This means there's bleeding somewhere in your esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Now, there are several things that could be causing this. It could be an ulcer, gastritis, or even a variceal bleed, which happens when veins in the esophagus become enlarged. I need to order some blood work to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which will tell us how much blood you’ve lost. I also want to order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood. And, to get a better look at what's going on inside, I recommend an upper endoscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to identify the source of the bleeding. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Gastritis? Variceal… whatchamacallit? Sounds serious, Doc. Real serious. And a camera down my throat? No thank you. I’ve seen enough cameras in my life, thank you very much. I work with… well, never mind. This is a mess. Just tell me straight, Doc. Am I gonna die? Is this somethin’ I can fix, or am I just… outta luck? I don't like fancy tests and fancy words. I just want to know what's goin' on and what you're gonna do about it. And how much is all this gonna cost? I ain't got money to throw around, Doc. Not anymore. My wife… she handled all that stuff. Now I'm just… lost. Tell me straight, Doc. What's the worst-case scenario here?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, it’s completely understandable that you’re scared and overwhelmed. I’m going to be honest with you, and I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. An upper gastrointestinal bleed can be serious, but it's often treatable. The worst-case scenario is significant blood loss leading to anemia, shock, or even death, but we're going to do everything we can to prevent that. The endoscopy is the best way to find the source of the bleeding so we can treat it. We can often stop the bleeding during the endoscopy with cautery or medication. Regarding cost, I understand your concerns. We have a financial counselor who can work with you to explore options, including potential assistance programs. I will have them reach out to you after this consultation. Right now, the most important thing is to determine the source of the bleeding and stop it. I am going to order the blood work and stool test immediately. I also strongly recommend the endoscopy. I will admit you to the hospital for observation and to manage the bleeding. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Always been healthy as a horse. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s it. I don’t believe in doctors. Never have. My wife… she always made me go. Said it was important. I just went along with it. But me? Always been fine. Tough as nails, that’s what my father always said. But this… this is different. This feels… bad. Real bad. I… I used to smoke, years ago. A pack a day, maybe more. Quit when my wife got sick. Didn't want her smellin' it on me. Been clean for… oh, must be ten years now. Does that matter? Anything matter anymore? Just tell me straight, Doc. Am I gonna be okay? Can you fix this? Just tell me the truth. No sugarcoatin'. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten years since quitting smoking is good. It does matter, Mr. Gentz. Smoking can contribute to ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems. Look, I can't guarantee anything, and I won't sugarcoat it. This is serious, and we need to act quickly. But I am optimistic that we can find the source of the bleeding and get it under control. We have excellent resources here, and I'll be with you every step of the way. The blood work will give us a better idea of how much blood you've lost, and the endoscopy will allow us to see exactly what's going on. Depending on what we find, we may need to give you medication to reduce stomach acid or even perform a procedure to stop the bleeding. I’m going to call the hospital now to let them know you’re coming in. In the meantime, try to relax as much as possible. I’ll have a nurse come in to take your vital signs and get you prepared for transport. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with, Doc. Get it over with. And tell the nurse to be gentle. This stomach… it’s sensitive. Just… please. Get it over with. I don't want to die. I don't want to die alone. .
DOCTOR: .
