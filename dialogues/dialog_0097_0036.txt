DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… good to meet you as well. My… the paperwork said something about a check-up before the insurance starts? I do not really understand all of this, to be honest. I just need to make sure everything is… acceptable for the insurance, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. It sounds like this is a preventative check-up to establish care and get everything documented so Medicare covers your visits going forward. That's a very smart thing to do. No worries at all about not understanding the paperwork – it is confusing! We’ll go through everything at your pace. So, to start, let’s just talk about you and your general health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… yes. I work, I eat, I sleep. It is… enough. I do not have much time for… feeling things, if you understand. I have a job at the processing plant, and it is… demanding. No big problems, no. I don’t go to the doctor often. It is a waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you're a busy man and prioritize getting things done. It’s good that you’re generally well, but even when things seem okay, a check-up can catch things early. That’s what we’re aiming for. You mentioned working at the processing plant. Is it physically demanding work?
PATIENT: Yes, very. Lifting, moving… things. It is not… delicate work. I stand all day. Sometimes it is hot, sometimes it is cold. There is… noise. Always noise. It is not a job for thinking, Doctor. It is a job for… doing. Are we finished with questions about the job? It is not a pleasant topic.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just trying to get a full picture. It’s helpful to know what your daily life is like. Standing all day, lifting, the heat, the noise... all those things can affect your health. Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—anything at all, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. No, not that I know of. My mother, she had… problems with her stomach, a long time ago. But that was in Yemen. I do not have a doctor there, and I have not seen a doctor here, until now. I have broken bones, when I was a boy, playing football. But they healed. Is that what you mean? A condition? I do not… have conditions. I work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Broken bones that healed don't typically count as ongoing conditions. And it's helpful to know about your mother’s history. Sometimes, family history can be important. When you say you haven’t seen a doctor here, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… no. Never been in a hospital. I am a strong man. I work through pain. A little ache, a little soreness… it is nothing. I do not… require hospitals. I fix things myself, if something is broken. Or I ignore it. Is that… bad? I do not know what is normal for a doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad at all. It’s actually quite common for people to try to tough things out. But sometimes, ignoring things can make them worse in the long run. That’s why we’re here – to make sure everything is okay, and to catch anything early if it isn’t. Let's talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I drink tea, sometimes. But that is not… a medication. I do not believe in taking pills unless it is absolutely necessary. My body is strong. It can handle things. My grandfather, he used herbs and spices. That is better than pills. This modern… medicine is too quick to prescribe things.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for a more natural approach, and I respect that. We can definitely discuss different options if needed. It’s good to know your feelings about medication. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I do not think so. I have eaten many things in my life. Different foods, different spices. Sometimes I have a… a stomach upset, but that is from eating too much, not from an allergy. Dust, maybe? Sometimes it makes me sneeze. Is that an allergy? I do not know. I have never had a… a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Occasional sneezing from dust is very common and doesn’t usually indicate a serious allergy. It sounds like you haven’t had any major allergic reactions. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never. I avoid hospitals, as I said. And I am careful with my work. I do not take risks. My father always said, “A careful man avoids the doctor.” It is a good saying. No surgeries. Nothing. I have a small scar on my hand, from when I was a boy, but it is just a scar. It is not from a surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it sounds like you were a careful boy! So, no surgeries, just a small scar. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother… she passed away, many years ago. My father… he is still alive, but he lives in Yemen. I do not see him often. We speak on the phone sometimes, but the connection is… not very good. He is an old man now. He is a farmer. He grows dates and spices. He is… a traditional man. He does not understand modern things. He would not come to this clinic. He says doctors are… unnecessary. Is that… rude, to say? I do not mean to be disrespectful.
DOCTOR: No, not at all rude. It sounds like he has strong beliefs, and that’s perfectly alright. It’s good to know about your mother and your father. Alright. One last question before we move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I do not… indulge in such things. It is… foolish. It weakens the body. It clouds the mind. I need to be strong and clear-headed for my work. It is a responsibility. My grandfather, he used to say, “A strong man needs a strong mind.” I follow his teachings. No smoking, no alcohol, no… recreational drugs. It is a waste of time and money. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: That is very admirable, Kiwane. It sounds like you live a very disciplined life. Yes, that is perfectly sufficient. Okay. So, just to recap, you’re generally healthy, work a physically demanding job, haven’t seen a doctor much, have no known allergies or medications, haven’t had any surgeries, and live a very healthy lifestyle. Now, if you’re comfortable with it, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… acceptable. As long as it is quick. I have work this afternoon. And I do not like to be… prodded and poked. But I understand it is necessary for the insurance. Very well. Do what you need to do, Doctor. But please be… gentle. And explain what you are doing, if you would be so kind. I do not understand modern medicine, as I said.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kiwane. I will absolutely explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. It will be a quick exam, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… very good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight for a moment. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We can talk about that later if needed. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears with this light. Ears look clear. And finally, I'll just take a look at your nose and throat. Throat looks good, no signs of infection. Everything seems normal so far, Kiwane. Do you have any questions about anything I’ve done so far?
PATIENT: Elevated… blood pressure? What does that mean? Is it… bad? I work hard, Doctor. It is a demanding job. Perhaps it is from the work? I do not feel sick. I do not have any… symptoms. And what about the insurance? Will this… elevation cause problems with the coverage? I need to make sure everything is… acceptable. Please explain, Doctor. I do not understand these… medical terms.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s perfectly normal to be concerned. Elevated blood pressure means your blood is pushing a little harder against the walls of your arteries than it should be. It’s not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it's something we want to keep an eye on. Think of it like a hose. If you squeeze the hose, the pressure inside goes up, right?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand that. Like squeezing the water hose at the plant. But what causes the squeezing? Is it from the work? Is it from stress? I do not… feel stressed, Doctor. I just… work. Is there something I need to do? Will I need… pills? I do not want pills.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. There are many things that can cause elevated blood pressure. Often, it’s a combination of factors. Your physically demanding job could be a factor, as it puts stress on your body. Other things like diet, family history, and even just age can play a role. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need pills right away. We can try some lifestyle changes first—things like reducing salt intake, getting regular exercise , and managing stress. We can talk about techniques for managing stress, even if you don’t feel particularly stressed. Sometimes, it's helpful to find ways to relax and unwind, even for a few minutes each day. Before we decide anything, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests just to get a better picture of your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for the elevated blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that is… acceptable. As long as it does not take too long. I have work, as you know. And I do not like needles. But if it is necessary for the insurance, I will… endure it. What kind of tests? And will I need to fast beforehand? I ate breakfast this morning. Will that… interfere with the results? I need to know these things, Doctor. I cannot simply… appear at the lab without preparation.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand your concerns. The blood tests will take about 15-20 minutes at the lab, and you’ll need to have an empty stomach for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. Water is fine. Since you had breakfast this morning, we’ll need to reschedule them for tomorrow morning. The tests we’re ordering are a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel , and a lipid panel . These tests will give us a good overview of your health and help us determine the best course of action for your blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: Latex… no, I do not think so. I have handled rubber gloves at the plant, but I have never had a… reaction. But what if I do have a reaction at the lab? Will they have something to help? I do not want to… faint or become ill. This is all very… complicated. Perhaps I should have simply ignored the insurance and continued working. It seems less stressful. But I suppose it is too late now. Very well. Tell me the location of this lab, and the time I should arrive tomorrow morning. And will I need to bring anything with me? A form? Identification? I need specific instructions, Doctor. I do not want any… surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I apologize if this all feels overwhelming. It's not a bad thing to get things checked out, and we'll take things one step at a time. The lab is located at 14 Oak Street, just a few blocks from here. It's open at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning. I recommend arriving around 8:15 to allow time for registration. You will need to bring your Medicare card and a photo ID—a driver's license or passport will work. You don’t need to fast tonight—we’ll start the fasting tomorrow morning. You don’t need to bring any forms, as they’ll have everything on file. They are equipped to handle any allergic reactions, but it's unlikely you’ll have one. If you do feel unwell at any time, let the lab technician know immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything… thoroughly. But what about the insurance? Will these tests… satisfy their requirements? Will they cover the cost? I do not want to be… burdened with a large bill. That would defeat the purpose of having insurance, yes? Very well. I will arrive at the lab tomorrow morning at 8:15 AM, with my Medicare card and identification. And I will remember to fast. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… patient with my questions. I suppose I am simply… anxious about these things. It is not something I am accustomed to. I prefer working.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiwane. I completely understand your anxiety – it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The tests should satisfy Medicare’s requirements for the initial preventative check-up. We’ll submit the results to them, and they’ll let you know if they need any additional information. I’ll also have my billing department verify your coverage beforehand to minimize any potential issues. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good evening, and get some rest. I’ll see you tomorrow morning. .
