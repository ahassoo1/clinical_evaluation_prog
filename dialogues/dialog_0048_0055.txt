DOCTOR: Right. Ellan Rannells. 74. Well, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor Sink, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on and on about it. Says it’ll help with… well, everything. I don’t quite understand it myself, but she’s quite insistent. And frankly, I’m tired of hearing about it. So, I thought I’d just… get a certification, see what all the fuss is about. If you can’t recommend it, well, that’s that. Don’t want to waste either of our time.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana… yes. A growing trend. Frankly, I’m not convinced of its widespread benefits, but… alright. So you’re seeking a certification primarily at your daughter’s behest?
PATIENT: “Primarily” is a… polite way of putting it, Doctor. She practically dragged me here. I’m a practical woman, you see. I’ve lived a long life without needing… alternative remedies. But she’s convinced it’ll help with my… joints. They ache, of course, at my age. But I manage. I take what the pharmacy gives me, and I get on with it. It's just… she won't stop talking about it. And frankly, I'd rather humor her than listen to another lecture.
DOCTOR: I see. And what exactly does the pharmacy give you for your… joints?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… Doctor, it’s been years, honestly. It’s a little white pill. I think it’s… Ibuprofen? Or maybe Naproxen? Something like that. They keep changing it, you see. And I don’t really pay attention to the names. As long as it dulls the ache, I’m satisfied. I take two in the morning, and two before bed, when it’s particularly bad. They don't cure anything, mind you. Just… take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you discussed this with a pharmacist?
PATIENT: A pharmacist? Heavens, no. Why would I bother a pharmacist? They just hand me the pills, tell me to take them with food, and I’m on my way. I’m not one for unnecessary chatter, Doctor. My time is valuable. Besides, my daughter handles the refills now. She knows all that… technical stuff. I just take the pills. Is that alright with you? Are we getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, at my age, what aren’t I experiencing? A little stiffness, a bit of tiredness… the usual. Nothing to write home about. My daughter says I should mention everything, but honestly, I don't see the point in burdening you with a laundry list of minor complaints. It's my joints that are the issue, if anything. Everything else is just… old age. Do you need a detailed account of my aches and pains, Doctor? It seems a bit… excessive.
DOCTOR: It’s important to have a complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, it comes and goes, doesn't it? Sometimes I eat like a bird, sometimes I have a good appetite. I suppose it's a little less than it used to be, now that I think about it. But I'm not exactly a growing girl anymore, am I? It’s not like I’m wasting away or anything. I still enjoy a good meal, when I'm up to it. My daughter worries too much, honestly. She thinks I'm not eating enough, but I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself. Is this what you need to write down for this… certificate?
DOCTOR: And any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, sleeping. That’s… variable. Some nights I sleep like a log, other nights I’m up half the night. Tossing and turning, you know? It’s not a new development, Doctor. I’ve never been a particularly sound sleeper. But it's not debilitating, if that's what you're asking. I manage. A little warm milk before bed helps sometimes. And honestly, after a long day, I’m usually exhausted enough to drift off eventually. Is this all going somewhere, Doctor? I do have other appointments, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Chest pain? Good heavens, no! What kind of question is that? I’m not sick, Doctor! I’m here for a certificate, not a diagnosis. I walk perfectly well, I climb the stairs, I haven’t had any chest pain in my life. My daughter asked me to mention everything, but honestly, she's being ridiculous. Are you nearly finished? I'm beginning to feel quite… interrogated. And honestly, all this questioning is making my joints ache even more.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve documented your responses. To be frank, based on what you’ve told me, I don’t see a medical necessity for a medical marijuana certification. Your symptoms appear to be well-managed, and there’s no indication of a condition that would warrant this type of treatment. I strongly advise you discuss your concerns with your primary care physician. They can provide a more thorough evaluation and determine the best course of action. I will not be issuing a certification today.
