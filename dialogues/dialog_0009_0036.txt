DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… good to meet you as well. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts. A physical, you said? It is required, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. A comprehensive physical is standard when initiating new insurance coverage, especially with Medicare. It allows us to establish a baseline of your current health. That’s very proactive of you to get it scheduled so quickly. Before we begin, can you confirm your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: Of course. It is… November 12, 1996. Is that correct? I do not always remember dates easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, November 12, 1996 – perfect. Thank you. And just to confirm, you're Kiwane Barban, and today’s date is August 2, 2025?
PATIENT: Yes, that is all correct. I am Kiwane Barban. And… today is August 2nd, you say? Yes. It feels warm today, does it not? Perhaps too warm for August.
DOCTOR: It certainly is warm, Mr. Barban. We’ve been having quite a heatwave. But we’ll try to keep things cool in here. Now, to get started with your physical, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No. Not… significant ones. I had the usual childhood things, I think. Chickenpox, maybe? But nothing… serious. I have not been to the hospital. I try to stay healthy. It is important.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. “Usual childhood things” is perfectly fine. We’re mainly looking for anything major. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I… do not like the idea of them. Too much cutting. I prefer to keep everything… intact.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Barban. Many people feel that way. Alright, let’s move on to family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or siblings have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm. My… father, he had problems with his stomach. Always complaining. But I do not know what it was. He did not go to the doctor much. My mother… she is still alive, thankfully. She is healthy, I believe. No… big illnesses. My sister… she has children. That is all I know. We do not talk often. It is… complicated.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Barban. It's alright if you don't have all the details. “Problems with his stomach” is still helpful information – we can explore that a bit later. And knowing your mother is currently healthy is good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean, exactly? I work. I eat. I sleep. Is that not a lifestyle? I work at the food processing plant. It is… steady work. Not exciting, but it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, Mr. Barban! By lifestyle, I mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. Also, how active are you typically?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I do not drink. And… recreational drugs? No. Never. I am a serious man. I need to be focused for my work. As for activity… I walk to work sometimes. And I walk around the plant. Is that enough? It is… a lot of standing.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Barban. That’s very good information. It sounds like you maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I eat everything. My mother made sure of it when I was small. She said it was important to be… robust. Though I do not like spicy food. It upsets my stomach. But that is not an allergy, I think. Just a… preference.
DOCTOR: A preference is perfectly valid! No, that wouldn't be considered an allergy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I do not take anything. I do not like putting things in my body that are not… food. My mother always said the best medicine is a good rest and a strong stomach. She was a wise woman.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Barban. It sounds like you had a very sensible mother. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… acceptable. As long as it is quick. I do not like being… poked and prodded. But it is required, yes? For the insurance. So, proceed. But please, be gentle. And explain what you are doing. I prefer to know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Barban. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll take it slow. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. This tells us how hard your heart is working. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76. That’s within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m going to take a look in your ears now. Your ear canals look clear, and your eardrums are normal. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your throat. Your throat looks clear as well. Everything appears to be normal so far. I'd like to take your temperature, and also check your pulse. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, which is also normal. Do you have any pain anywhere at the moment?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Sometimes my back aches after a long day at the plant, but that is… normal. From standing and lifting. It goes away with rest. I do not consider it pain. Just… discomfort. Is that alright? I did not want to mention something… insignificant.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Barban. Discomfort from standing and lifting is very common in your line of work, and it’s good that it resolves with rest. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, everything appears to be within normal limits. To get a more comprehensive picture of your health, I’d like to order a few routine blood tests. This will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and some other basic levels. It's standard procedure when starting with a new doctor and insurance. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, I suppose. If it is required. I do not like needles, but… I understand it is necessary. Where will this be done? And how long will it take? I have work, you see. I cannot be gone for too long.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Barban. We can do the blood tests right here in the clinic. It should only take about 15-20 minutes total – a little bit for the paperwork, and then a few minutes for the actual blood draw. The lab technician is very skilled, and it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. We’ll get the results back in about a week, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. A week is… acceptable. And 15-20 minutes. I can manage that. Very well. Let us get it done. I have work to return to. Please, tell me exactly what I need to do. And what I need to avoid before the test. I do not want to cause any… complications.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Barban. The main thing is to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the test. That means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water. Also, avoid strenuous exercise the day before. I’ll give you this lab requisition form to take to the lab technician. They’ll draw the blood. Do you have any questions about the fasting or anything else?
PATIENT: Fasting. No food. Only water. I can do that. Eight to twelve hours. I will need to plan my dinner carefully tonight. And no strenuous exercise. That is… good. I do not exercise much anyway. I think… no. I do not have any other questions. Just tell me where the lab technician is located. And I will go. I want to get this done quickly. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… helpful. Even if I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Barban. I’m glad I could help. The lab technician is just down the hall to your left, in room 3. They're expecting you. After the test, feel free to come back, and we can schedule your follow-up appointment. If you experience any dizziness or lightheadedness after the blood draw, please let the nurse know right away. And don’t worry about the needles too much – it’s usually just a quick pinch. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No. I believe that is all. A quick pinch. I will… try to remember that. Thank you again, Doctor. I will go to room 3 now.
