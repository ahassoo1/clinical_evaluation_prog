DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just... a check-up, I suppose. Something about needing clearance for... work. Acting work. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I get asked to do these things from time to time. It's mostly just to be sure I'm still… upright. Is that what this is for?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. A check-up to ensure you're fit for work is a very reasonable reason to be here. And yes, confirming you're "upright" – as you put it – is definitely part of it! To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about the acting work itself?
PATIENT: Acting… well, I mostly usher. Or, I did. Lobby work, ticket taking. Small parts, you know? Nothing glamorous. I haven’t done much lately, though. A few gigs here and there. It’s… been a while. Honestly, Doctor, I can barely remember the last production. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It's probably why they want me checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this check-up is a good idea, especially with some changes in your work schedule and some concerns about your memory. We'll definitely take that into consideration. To get a clearer picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: A primary care… oh, dear. Not regularly, no. I used to, years ago. When my wife was still… around. But things got… complicated. After the divorce, I mostly just ignored it, to be honest. Just went to the emergency room if something really flared up. Which wasn't often, thankfully. I'm generally a… resilient fellow. Though, like I said, the memory… Is that something you need details about? Because I really don't have much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. We can certainly work with that. It's not uncommon for things to fall by the wayside during difficult times. Since you haven't been with a primary care doctor recently, let's start with what's been going on right now. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – anything that's bothering you at all, whether it's physical or just feeling off?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Physical… my knees ache a bit, especially after standing for too long. Which, admittedly, is most of my day when I'm working. And sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded. Not often, just a brief spell. Nothing serious. The “feeling off” part… that’s mostly just the memory, I think. Little things. Forgetting names. Misplacing my keys. You know, old age creeping up. Is that what you’re looking for? Anything serious? No, not really. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain and occasional lightheadedness, along with some memory concerns. We'll definitely explore those. It's good you've noticed these things. Let's talk a little bit more about the lightheadedness. Does it happen when you stand up quickly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it, it usually does. I stand up too fast, and everything goes a bit… swimmy. Just for a moment. I always have to hold onto something. I thought it was just… me being clumsy, honestly. It doesn’t happen every time, but it’s often enough that I’ve gotten used to bracing myself. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know – lightheadedness upon standing. That could be a sign of something called orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when you stand up. It's not necessarily serious, but it's something we should investigate further. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I suppose it's been a little smaller. I don’t eat as much as I used to. Mostly because I don't really feel hungry, I guess. And weight… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Probably lost a few pounds. I'm quite thin, actually. Always have been, but maybe thinner now. It’s not something I worry about. I eat when I'm hungry, and I sleep when I'm tired. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss. That's good information. Just one more quick question before we move on to your past medical history: have you had any fever, chills, or recent infections?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I recall. Chills… perhaps a slight shiver here and there, but nothing significant. Infections… not recently. I had a bad cold a couple of winters ago, but that was about it. I'm usually quite healthy, Doctor. Truly. I think I’ve just been… lucky. Or maybe it’s the standing around all day. Keeps the blood flowing. Honestly, I’m probably wasting your time with all this. It’s probably just old age catching up.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Mr. Krahn. It's important to gather as much information as possible. Even what seems like minor details can be helpful. Alright, let's move on to your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a bit of a blur. My wife always handled the medical things. She kept all the records. After… well, never mind. I think I had high blood pressure at one point, years ago. But I honestly don’t remember if I was ever put on any medication for it. It was a long time ago. And again, I’m just fuzzy on the details. I might have had something else, too, but it’s all a jumble. I apologize. My memory really is dreadful. Perhaps you could just… check things? I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. We can certainly do some tests to get a clearer picture. It's not uncommon for details to be forgotten, especially after a long time and difficult circumstances. Let's try this: Have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Surgery… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, I think. That's the only surgery I can recall. And… I was hospitalized once, years ago, for a bad bout of pneumonia. I was quite sick, but I recovered fully. That was… oh, must have been thirty years ago. I don't remember much else. It all seems so distant. Is this helpful? I feel like I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: This is helpful, Mr. Krahn. It's good to know you had your appendix out and were hospitalized for pneumonia. Knowing what you have gone through is just as important as knowing what you haven't. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's… complicated. My parents passed away a long time ago. My mother… she had heart problems, I believe. She was always frail. And my father… he had some sort of stomach trouble, but I don’t know the specifics. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. I honestly don’t know anything about her medical history. I’m not very good at keeping track of these things, Doctor. I apologize. It's probably not much help.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s understandable. We can't control what information we have access to. Knowing that your mother had heart problems is helpful. Before we move on, let's quickly go through a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't touched a drink in… well, decades. My wife didn't approve. And I have no interest in… recreational things. Just a quiet life, Doctor. That's all I've ever wanted. Though, a quiet life seems to be getting harder and harder to maintain these days. But no, no bad habits. Just old age and a bad memory.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krahn. So, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. Though, sometimes I get a bit of a rash when I use certain soaps. But that’s probably just sensitive skin. Nothing serious. No life-threatening allergies. Just a bit of a fussy complexion. Is that all? Can we be done soon? I feel a bit… drained.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known serious allergies. Just a bit of sensitive skin. Alright, Mr. Krahn, that covers most of the important history questions. I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me, even though it's been difficult to recall some of it. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Anything to get this over with. Though, please, be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be. And if I start to feel lightheaded, just let me know. I’m sure you’re very good at what you do, Doctor. Let’s just… get it over with. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We’ll take things slowly and gently. I'll let you know if I need you to do anything. Okay, your blood pressure is a little bit high, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart. I hear a slight murmur, which is common with age, but we’ll want to investigate that further. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is also common with age. And finally, let's do a quick balance test. Your balance is a little unsteady. Okay, Mr. Krahn, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, there are a few things I want to investigate further. Your elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, diminished reflexes, and unsteady balance all warrant some additional testing. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a CT scan of your brain to rule out any underlying neurological issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A CT scan? That sounds… serious. And all those tests… Will it take long? Look, Doctor, I just need clearance to work. Is any of this going to prevent me from ushering? I don’t want to lose my job. I just want to be sure I’m not falling apart, but I really can’t afford to be out of work. What does all this mean? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. It's completely normal to feel anxious when hearing about tests, especially when you're worried about your job. Let me assure you, ordering these tests doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It's simply a precautionary measure to get a more complete picture of your overall health and rule out any potential underlying issues. The tests will help us determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure, investigate the heart murmur, and assess your balance and neurological function. As for whether it will prevent you from working, it's too early to say. We need the results of the tests first. However, I can write a note to your employer stating that you are undergoing medical evaluation, and we can discuss potential restrictions based on the results. The tests themselves should take a few hours to complete, and the results usually come back within a few days. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. We'll discuss the results and develop a plan based on what we find. Does that sound more reassuring?
PATIENT: A few days… Yes, that’s… acceptable. And a note to my employer… that would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I just… I worry. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I don’t want to fall and hurt myself. Or worse. So, a note, a few days, and then we’ll see. That sounds… manageable. Can we schedule a follow-up appointment for then? Just to discuss the results? And… could you possibly write down the names of the tests? Just so I can… remember. It's a silly request, I know. But it would put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. No request is silly at all. It’s good to be proactive about your health. I'll write a note to your employer explaining that you’re undergoing medical evaluation and may have some temporary restrictions based on the results. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in five business days – that would be August 8th at 2:00 PM. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: August 8th at 2:00 PM… Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it more than you know. And the note… that’s a weight off my shoulders. I think… I think that’s everything. Unless… is there anything I need to do? Any specific instructions before the tests? Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. I just want to get this over with and get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I'm happy to help. As for instructions before the tests, it’s relatively straightforward. For the blood work, it’s best to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks other than water. For the CT scan, you may be asked to remove any jewelry or metal objects. We’ll give you specific instructions when you arrive at the imaging center. Otherwise, just try to relax and get some rest. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a list of the tests we’ve ordered: 1. Complete Blood Count : Measures the different types of cells in your blood. 2. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel : Provides information about your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. 3. Electrocardiogram : Records the electrical activity of your heart. 4. CT Scan of the Brain: Provides detailed images of your brain. I’ll also provide you with a printed copy of this list and the contact information for the imaging center. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I really appreciate your kindness and patience. I… I suppose I’ll see you on August 8th then. Thank you again for everything. I hope the tests don’t take too long. And I hope they don’t find anything too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do everything I can to ensure a smooth and comfortable experience. Remember, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly on August 8th and develop a plan based on what we find. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I’ll see you then.
