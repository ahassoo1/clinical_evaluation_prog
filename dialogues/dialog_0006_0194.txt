DOCTOR: Right, Terasa MayHugh. 59 years old. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… um, it’s my ears, mostly. They… well, they sometimes just… stop working. And I get really dizzy when that happens. It’s a bit scary, to be honest. It doesn't happen all the time, thankfully. My daughter, Lani, she said I should come in… she worries.
DOCTOR: Ears, and dizziness… comes and goes, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Comes and goes. Not every day, not even every week. It’s just… sudden. Like someone flipped a switch. And then it might come back on its own, or… well, I'm not always sure what brings it back, if anything. It’s been happening… oh dear, how long? Lani would know better, she keeps track of things. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Well, we’ll figure it out. Let's see… you said your daughter mentioned this has been going on for a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, she has. She says… oh, goodness, I think a few months now? Maybe longer? It’s hard to say. It didn't bother me too much at first, but it's happened a couple of times recently, and it’s starting to worry me. And… my father, he used to have trouble with his balance too. I don’t know if that matters.
DOCTOR: A few months… and your father had balance issues. Okay. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, or any fullness or pressure?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yes. A faint ringing, like a high-pitched whine. It’s not constant, just… now and then. And fullness… not usually. Maybe a little bit before it stops working, like my ear is blocked? But it’s hard to tell. Honestly, it all feels a bit jumbled when it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "stops working," do you mean you can’t hear anything at all, or is it more like sounds are muffled?
PATIENT: Oh, nothing at all. Just… silence. Like someone turned off the volume. It’s quite frightening, I must say. Then, maybe later… a whooshing sound, and then slowly, sound comes back. It's never been a gradual thing though, always sudden.
DOCTOR: Sudden loss of hearing, then a whooshing sound, and it returns. Okay. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. That's what's so strange about it, really. No ache, no throbbing, just… silence and dizziness. It's the dizziness that worries me the most, to be honest. I’m afraid of falling.
DOCTOR: Right, the dizziness is concerning. Okay. Now, have you noticed if anything triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers…? Oh dear. I haven't noticed anything specific. Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting quietly, reading. Other times, it seems to come out of nowhere. Lani thinks maybe when I'm tired? But I'm always a little tired these days, to be honest. I really don't know. I try not to think about it too much, if that makes sense. It’s unsettling, waiting for it to happen again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers, happens with activity or rest. Alright. Let’s do a quick look in your ears and check your balance. It’ll just be a simple exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. Just… please be gentle? My ears are rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let me just have you sit up straight, and I’ll take a quick look. Okay… ears look clear, no obvious blockage or inflammation. The ear drums do look a little… dull, though. Not a significant amount, but worth noting. And now, just follow my finger with your eyes… nice and smooth. Good… Now look at your nose. Alright. A little unsteady, but not dramatic. Okay. It could be something with your inner ear, possibly a touch of fluid imbalance. The dull ear drums could indicate some fluid build-up. We’ll need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… complicated. Fluid imbalance? Further testing? What sort of testing? I hope it’s not anything too unpleasant. I really don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t have to be unpleasant. The most common test is an audiogram – a hearing test – just wearing headphones and responding to sounds. And we might consider a balance test, called a VNG – videonystagmography – which involves wearing goggles and looking at different things while we measure your eye movements. It's non-invasive, mostly just a bit unusual. It'll help us pinpoint the cause of the dizziness and hearing loss. Would you be willing to schedule those?
PATIENT: Headphones and sounds… that sounds alright, I suppose. Goggles, though… …are you sure you need the goggles? It sounds a bit… much. But… if it will help, I guess I can manage. When would I need to come back? I have a bingo night on Fridays, you see.
DOCTOR: The goggles give us more detailed information, but we can discuss it further if you’re uncomfortable. We'll schedule the audiogram first, and then decide about the VNG. We can try to work around your bingo night. How about Tuesday afternoon?
PATIENT: Tuesday… let me see. Yes, Tuesday afternoon should be alright. My daughter, Lani, she can take me, thank goodness. She worries so. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just come as you are, and try to get a good night’s sleep beforehand. And don’t worry about messing it up – the technician will walk you through everything. We'll get a better understanding of what's going on, and then we can discuss a plan. Alright, let me get that scheduled for you… 2 PM on Tuesday. And I’ll write you a referral for the audiogram, and a note about your concerns. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly good. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It’s a bit overwhelming, all this medical talk, but you’ve made it easier to understand.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. That’s what I'm here for. We'll take it one step at a time. Now, do you have any other concerns or questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, thank goodness. Just… this dizziness… is it… dangerous? Will I fall and break something? That’s what I worry about the most.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried about falling. While the dizziness can be unsettling, it doesn't necessarily mean you're at immediate risk. We want to figure out the cause of it, and that's what the testing will help us do. In the meantime, I'd recommend being careful, especially in crowded or dimly lit areas. And avoid sudden movements if possible. We'll also talk about some exercises that can help improve your balance once we have a diagnosis. We are going to work to get this sorted out, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, doctor. That does make me feel a little bit better. I appreciate your patience. I suppose I should be going then? Lani is probably waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m sure she is. Here’s the referral again, just in case. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before Tuesday. Take care, Terasa.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor Gorga. Goodbye.
