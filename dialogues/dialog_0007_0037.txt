DOCTOR: Hi Margret, good to meet you. I'm Valerie. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Valerie. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. Yes, wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. Especially when I walk quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, wheezing, and it’s worse with activity like walking. That’s helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think… It was… maybe two months ago? Yes, about two months. It started slowly. Just a little bit of trouble catching my breath. I thought it was just because I was getting older, you know? But it has gotten… more. Now I really notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, about two months ago, starting gradually and getting worse. And you're noticing it more now, especially with exertion. Have you had any other symptoms along with the wheezing – things like a cough, chest tightness, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I have a cough. Not a bad cough, but it is there. Mostly in the mornings. And sometimes my chest feels… tight. Like a band around it. No fever, though. Not that I have noticed. I always check, because my grandson, he gets sick often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, mostly in the mornings, and some chest tightness. No fever, that’s good. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung problems before?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. I have always been very healthy, you know? I work as an athletic trainer, I keep people moving! I have helped many young people with their muscles and bones, but never anything with my lungs. This is… new for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your history of being healthy and your work as an athletic trainer. So this is new. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor. Never. I do not smoke. My husband, he used to… a long time ago, but he stopped many years before we divorced. It is very bad for the health, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, definitely. Okay, good. And are you around anyone who smokes regularly?
PATIENT: No, no one. My son, he does not smoke. And my grandson… he is too young for such things! I make sure he stays away from anyone who does. It's important to protect our lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So no exposure to secondhand smoke either. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, yes. It is… Lisinopril, I think that is the name. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take Ibuprofen. Just when I need it. And… a vitamin D, because the doctor said my levels were low last year. That is all, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Vitamin D. Thank you for that information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat many different foods, and I have never had a bad reaction. The doctors have given me different medicines over the years, and I have been fine with all of them. I always tell them if I feel strange, though! It is important to be careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, Margret, I’m going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope now, and I may also check your oxygen levels with a small sensor on your finger. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. My lungs… they feel a little tight sometimes, so listening is good. I hope they are not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and out… good. And again… in and out. I do hear some wheezing in both lungs, particularly when you exhale. It’s not extremely loud, but it’s definitely present. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is acceptable, but a little on the lower end of normal. Let's also check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 78. We will do a few more tests to be sure, but I am leaning towards this being an early sign of asthma, possibly brought on by some mild inflammation.
PATIENT: Asthma? Oh my. I have never had asthma before. Is it… serious? I have always been so strong, you know? This is a little frightening. Inflammation… what causes that? Is it something I ate? Or maybe the air?
DOCTOR: It can be concerning to hear a new diagnosis, I understand. But it's good we’re looking into this now. Asthma can be very manageable with the right treatment. It's not about being strong or not, it's about how your airways react to certain triggers. Inflammation can be caused by a lot of things – allergies, irritants in the air like dust or pollen, even a cold or the flu. It's not necessarily something you ate. We will need to do some further testing to pinpoint what might be causing your inflammation. I'd like to order a spirometry test, which measures how much air you can breathe in and out, and a chest X-ray to rule out anything else. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds alright. If it will help me breathe better, I will do whatever you think is best. A spirometry test… and a chest X-ray. Are those… painful? I do not like needles, you know. And I worry about the radiation from the X-ray.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Neither of those tests are painful. The spirometry test is just breathing into a machine – you’ll have to blow hard for a few seconds, but it doesn’t involve any needles. And the chest X-ray uses a very low dose of radiation – it's much less than you’d get from a cross-country flight, and it gives us a very helpful picture of your lungs. We take precautions to minimize your exposure. I will order those tests for you now. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of an inhaled corticosteroid to help reduce the inflammation in your airways. It's a preventative measure, and it should help you breathe easier. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An inhaler… like the people with bad asthma use? Oh dear. Will I have to carry it around all the time? And will it make me… weak? I worry about not being able to keep up with my grandson. He loves to run and jump, and I want to be able to play with him!
DOCTOR: It's a very common worry, Margret, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. This inhaler is a low dose, and it’s meant as a short-term treatment to get the inflammation under control. It’s not necessarily something you’ll have to carry around all the time – we’ll see how you respond to it and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. And no, it won’t make you weak! In fact, by opening up your airways, it should make it easier for you to breathe and keep up with your grandson. The goal is to get you feeling back to your normal self, so you can enjoy playing with him. We will assess how you are doing after the test results come in and see if a longer-term maintenance inhaler is necessary. In the meantime, this is just to provide some relief and get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound more reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that does sound more reassuring. If it will help me play with my grandson, I will try it. And you will assess me… after the test results? You think you can find out what is making me wheeze? Oh, that would be wonderful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s exactly what we’re going to do. We’ll look at the results of the spirometry test and X-ray, and we can discuss possible triggers – allergies, irritants, even environmental factors. Sometimes we’ll do allergy testing to pinpoint specific allergens. We will work together to find out what's causing the wheezing and get it under control. I’m going to write you a prescription for the inhaler now. The nurse will go over how to use it properly before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… no, I think you have answered all my questions. You have been very kind, Doctor Valerie. I feel much better now, knowing we are trying to find out what is happening. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Remember, we're a team, and we'll work through this together. The nurse will be in shortly to review the inhaler instructions and schedule your tests. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
