DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It is a pleasure. Though, honestly, it’s rather…uncomfortable to be discussing this. It’s about…well, a personal matter. My…friend…has been experiencing some…discharge. It’s quite unsightly, really. I’m here on his behalf, of course. He’s…a bit embarrassed to come himself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. It takes courage to seek medical attention for sensitive issues, and I appreciate you bringing him in today. We will, of course, maintain complete confidentiality. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…not a large amount, thankfully. But it’s…yellowish. And…rather thick. He noticed it about…oh, a week ago, I suppose. He thought it might just be…something he ate, at first. But it hasn't gone away. He’s usually very…fastidious, you see. Keeps everything quite clean. This is very unlike him. Is it…something serious, Doctor? I do hope it isn’t. He’s…not a young man, anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Wartick. A week ago, and a yellowish, thick discharge… I see. It's good that he’s typically fastidious; that helps us understand changes. While it's difficult to say definitively without an examination, any new discharge warrants investigation. It could be several things, ranging from a simple infection to something requiring more attention. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if he's experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. He has been…a bit more irritable lately. More than usual, I mean. And he’s been going to the…restroom rather frequently. Not, necessarily, to go, if you understand me. Just…going more often. He also mentioned a slight…burning sensation, but he dismissed it as indigestion. He does have a delicate stomach, you see. Honestly, Doctor, he’s a bit of a hypochondriac. Always worrying about something.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased irritability, frequent restroom visits even without needing to go, and a slight burning sensation that he attributes to indigestion. Thank you for sharing all of this, Ms. Wartick. It's helpful to have a complete picture, even his tendency to worry. To proceed, I’d like to ask a few more questions about his medical history, if you don’t mind. Has he ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, or sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a delicate subject. He’s…not one to speak openly about such things. Let me see… I believe he had a rather unpleasant bout of…something, when he was younger. A skin condition, I think. But I don't recall the specifics. And…he's always been quite healthy, otherwise. No diabetes, no heart trouble. He used to be very active, but…well, age catches up with us all, doesn’t it? As for… those kinds of things… I truly couldn’t say. He’s always been…discreet. Are you sure you need to know? It’s all rather…improper.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It's perfectly alright if you're not comfortable sharing details. Knowing about any past skin conditions could be relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. And it's also helpful to know he’s generally been healthy. To clarify, when you say a skin condition, do you recall approximately when this occurred?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it must have been… goodness, it was decades ago. Perhaps in his late twenties, early thirties? He was living in…Barcelona at the time, I believe. He was…involved with a woman, and it started shortly after that. It wasn’t serious, thankfully. Just a few…rashes, mostly. He saw a doctor, of course, had some ointment prescribed, and it cleared up quickly. He doesn't like to dwell on the past, you see. It was…a difficult time for him. Is that helpful, Doctor? I truly hope this isn’t taking too long. I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Wartick, thank you. A skin condition in his late twenties, early thirties while living in Barcelona… That provides some important context. And no, you are not taking too long at all. We want to be thorough. Now, could you tell me about his family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s another…difficult subject. He wasn’t particularly close to his family, I’m afraid. His mother passed away when he was quite young, and his father… well, he wasn’t a very affectionate man. He had an older brother, but they lost touch years ago. I don’t believe there’s a history of any…serious illnesses, as far as I know. Though, his father did suffer from…arthritis, I think. And his mother… she had headaches. Constant headaches. But nothing more than that, as far as I’m aware. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather vague. He never spoke much about his family. They weren’t very…refined, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss of his mother at a young age, a distant relationship with his father and brother, and a history of arthritis and headaches in his parents… Thank you for sharing what you recall. Now, to complete the picture, could you tell me about any medications he is currently taking, or any allergies he may have?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. He takes a small blue pill every morning, for his…prostate, I believe. Something to help him…sleep. And he occasionally takes an antacid, when his stomach bothers him. As for allergies… he’s always been rather sensitive to pollen, especially in the spring. And he’s allergic to shellfish, of course. A rather unfortunate allergy. Makes dining out quite difficult. And… oh, yes! He had a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin when he was a child. Nearly died, according to his aunt. Is that everything, Doctor? I really must be going soon. This has been…exhausting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wartick. That is very helpful. A small blue pill for his prostate, occasional antacids, allergies to pollen and shellfish, and a penicillin allergy. Given the information you've provided – the yellowish discharge, irritability, frequent restroom visits, and his medical history – I would like to conduct a physical examination. This will help me assess his condition and determine the best course of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. That. Well… I suppose so. But… I must insist on being present during the examination. He would be terribly embarrassed if… well, if anyone else were to… examine him. I can ensure his modesty, you see. And I can explain everything to him afterward. It’s rather… delicate, you understand. I wouldn't want him to feel…uncomfortable. Is that acceptable, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. Your comfort and his comfort are my priority. I am happy to have you present during the examination. I will explain everything as I go, and we will proceed at a pace that is comfortable for both of you. I will need to ask him to change into a gown, and I will perform a basic physical assessment, including listening to his heart and lungs, and then a more focused examination to assess the source of the discharge. Is he here with you now?
PATIENT: Yes, he is. He’s in the waiting room, nervously reading an old magazine. He’s… rather particular about magazines, you see. Only the glossy ones, with lots of pictures. He hates those articles about…current events. Honestly, he’s a bit of a fussbudget. I’ll go and retrieve him. Though, I must warn you, he may be a bit…difficult. He doesn't like being told what to do. And he’s terribly self-conscious. I'll be right back, Doctor. Please, make yourself comfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I will be here, and we will take things at his pace. Thank you for letting me know, and please don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do to make him more comfortable. I'll be right here when you return.
