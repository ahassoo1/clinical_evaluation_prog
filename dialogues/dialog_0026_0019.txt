DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me? My wife, she want... baby. We old, you know? She think maybe need some help to make baby. I think so too. It been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. You and your wife are hoping to start a family. And it’s been some time, so you’re looking into options to help with that. That’s perfectly alright. Just to clarify, Mr. Carlotta, are you and your wife already trying, or are you just beginning to explore the possibilities?
PATIENT: Trying... yes, a little. Not much, though. Mostly talking. She say maybe need check… everything. I not remember much about it, to be honest. Long time ago when we have others. She do most of the remembering, my wife. Very good memory, she have.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It has been a long time. So, it sounds like you’re both hoping to see if there’s anything we can do to help make this possible. Let’s start with a little bit of background, if you don’t mind. I’ll just ask a few questions, and you tell me what you remember. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... medical? I think... no. Not that I remember. I go to the doctor sometimes, for check-ups. Old man things, you know? But no big sickness. My wife, she has… something with her heart, maybe? Small thing, she take pills for it. I forget the name. She go to a different doctor for that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And you said you have regular check-ups?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Every year. Doctor Patel, he good doctor. He check my… everything. Blood, you know? And listen to my heart. Says I’m okay for old man. Not strong, but okay. I think. It’s always a little blurry what he says.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. And do you remember anything about past surgeries or hospital stays, either for you or your wife?
PATIENT: Surgery… hmm. I think… when I was young, I break my arm. Playing football. Long time ago, in Somalia. And my wife… she had something with her belly when she was young woman. I not remember exactly. Something to do with… inside. She was in hospital for a little while. But that was long before we meet. She doesn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in either of your families – things like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she live long time. Very strong woman. No sickness. My father… he have something with his legs, maybe? They hurt him when he old. But not sure. We not talk much about sickness in my family. Very private people, my family. My wife's family… she say her grandfather have something with his heart. But that was long time ago. She know more about that side, my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It's common for families to not discuss these things openly. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. I never smoke. Not good. Alcohol… sometimes, small glass of wine with dinner. Very small. And drugs… never. Not for me. I am old man, I like quiet life. My wife, she maybe small glass of wine too. Sometimes. But not much. We mostly drink tea.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your current medications. You mentioned your wife takes pills for her heart. Do you take any medications regularly yourself?
PATIENT: Medication… hmm. Yes, yes. For my water. I have to… go to the bathroom a lot, you know? Old man things. Small blue pill. And sometimes, for my joints. They hurt when it is cold. White pill. That's all, I think. Small pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Sometimes my stomach feel funny, but not allergy. Just old man stomach, I think. My wife… she maybe little allergy to some flowers. Makes her nose itchy. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a general sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is fine. Exam is good. See if old man still working. You do what you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. . Okay, a little elevated, but not terribly concerning for your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. . Alright, everything sounds okay there, though a murmur is present. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen now. . And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. . Okay, everything seems generally good. I did notice a slight murmur when listening to your heart. It's likely benign, but we may want to get an EKG to be sure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Murmur… hmm. Doctor Patel, he say something about murmur too. Small murmur, he say. Not worry about. EKG… what is EKG? Is that… scary? I not like scary things. If Doctor Patel say okay, I think I’m okay. But if you think I need, I trust you, Doctor. You seem like good doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to say. An EKG is a very simple test, Mr. Carlotta – it doesn’t hurt at all. It just measures the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us get a better understanding of that murmur Doctor Patel mentioned and ensure everything is functioning as it should. It’s a quick and painless procedure. We can do it right here in the office. Since Doctor Patel already noted the murmur, it’s a good precautionary step. Would you like to proceed with the EKG today?
PATIENT: Okay. If Doctor Patel say okay, and you think so too… then yes. Let’s do the test. Get it over with. Better safe than sorry, you know? But be gentle, please. Old man heart, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very gentle. It will only take a few minutes. Alright, just relax and breathe normally. I'll let you know when we're finished. Okay, all done. Now we’ll just wait a moment for the results to print. It seems you have some mild thickening of the heart muscle, and some minor changes that don’t necessarily indicate a problem, but do warrant further discussion. I'll review these results more thoroughly and explain everything to you. It's likely something you've had for some time, but we need to monitor it. Mr. Carlotta, the EKG shows some mild thickening of the heart muscle, and some minor changes. It is very possible this is not a new development and not concerning, but for your wife’s sake and considering her heart condition, I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… that is… heart doctor, yes? My wife… she already see one. You think my heart is bad? I feel okay. Little tired sometimes, but old man things, you know? Maybe I just need more tea. If my wife see one, maybe I should too. Yes, okay. If you think so, Doctor. For my wife, and for me. But I hope it is not too scary.
DOCTOR: It’s not about scary, Mr. Carlotta, it’s about being thorough. It's good your wife already sees a cardiologist - that makes things easier. A cardiologist is a specialist, and they can do more in-depth testing to get a clearer picture of your heart health. The mild changes on the EKG are not necessarily a cause for alarm, but it’s best to have them checked out, especially considering your wife’s heart condition. I’ll go ahead and write a referral for you. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment with her cardiologist, or would you prefer to do that yourself?
PATIENT: If you can help me schedule, that would be good. My wife, she do all the scheduling. I just… show up. I forget the doctor’s name, and the phone number. She would be mad if I try. You help me, I think. That is good. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. Happy to help. Okay, I’ve scheduled an appointment for you with Dr. Ramirez on August 16th at 2:00 PM. They’re aware of your wife’s existing appointment schedule and will coordinate accordingly. I will print a referral for you to take with you. Now, regarding your desire to start a family, it’s important to know that age does play a role in fertility. Given your wife’s heart condition, it’s also crucial to discuss the potential risks and benefits of pregnancy with her cardiologist. Once we have the results from the cardiology evaluation, we can discuss options like fertility counseling and assisted reproductive technologies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That sounds… good. So many doctors. So many tests. My wife, she will know what to do. She always does. Fertility counseling… what is that? Is that talking? I not good at talking about… feelings. But if it help make baby, I will try. Just… not too much talking, please. And please, no scary tests.
DOCTOR: Fertility counseling is mostly talking, yes, but it's a safe space to discuss your concerns and learn about your options. It’s not about sharing personal feelings, it’s about understanding the science of fertility and making informed decisions. I can recommend a counselor who is experienced in working with older couples. As for the tests, we’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll start with the cardiology evaluation, and then we’ll discuss other tests if necessary. There’s no pressure to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Here's the referral to Dr. Ramirez, and a brochure with information about fertility counseling. I've also written down a summary of today’s visit and the EKG results for you to take home. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think… no. Too much information. I will give these to my wife. She will know what to do. Thank you, Doctor. You very patient with old man. Very kind. I hope… I hope we can make baby. That would be good. I think… I think that is all. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was my pleasure. Remember, take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I wish you and your wife all the best. Take care now. And please, give my best to your wife. .
