DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s not really a problem problem, you understand. It’s just… my sister, she always gets these lovely cards when she’s feeling a bit under the weather. From her doctor, you see. Such a nice touch. I thought… well, I thought you might do something similar? A little “get well soon” or just… encouragement, you know? It just lifts the spirits.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janeth. It’s wonderful that your sister’s doctor provides those cards – a small gesture can make a big difference. We certainly aim to provide compassionate care here. However, my primary role today is to understand what’s going on with your health. While I appreciate your sister's experience, let's focus on what's brought you in to see me today. Is there anything specific that’s been bothering you, or any health concerns you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh, well, when you put it that way… It’s just… nothing’s wrong, exactly. I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. It’s just… a little something to brighten the day, you know? My sister has a bad back, always complaining, and she gets a card. I just thought… it’s a nice gesture. Is that so hard to understand? You’re a doctor, you should be thoughtful.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand wanting to feel valued and cared for, Janeth. And you’re right, being thoughtful is a very important part of being a doctor. I apologize if I seemed dismissive earlier. To clarify, you’re saying you don’t have any health concerns at all that prompted you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: No, that’s right. Nothing at all! Perfectly healthy. I walk every day, I eat good food, I sleep just fine. It's just… a little something nice would be lovely. My sister’s doctor, he understands. He sends a lovely card with a little flower on it. You don't even have to write anything fancy, just… a little acknowledgment that I exist, you know? It’s not too much to ask, is it?
DOCTOR: Janeth, I want to be sure I'm understanding you correctly. You’ve come to see me today primarily because you would appreciate receiving a “get well” card, similar to the one your sister receives, even though you are feeling perfectly healthy and have no health concerns?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. You see? It's really quite simple. It's about being… seen. A little kindness goes a long way, Doctor. My sister, she’s always making a fuss, and she gets a card. I just thought, as a doctor, you would… understand that sometimes people need a little boost, even if they aren’t sick. It shows you care, you know? A little flower on the card would be nice. Not a big, showy one, mind you, something delicate.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I appreciate you explaining that so clearly. I understand your desire for a little acknowledgment and a gesture of kindness. While providing cards isn’t a standard part of my practice, I can certainly see how a small gesture could be meaningful. However, as a medical professional, my priority is to address health concerns and provide appropriate care. Since you've stated you are feeling perfectly healthy and have no concerns, a medical examination isn't necessary at this time. I am happy to write a small note acknowledging your visit and wishing you continued good health. Would that be satisfactory?
PATIENT: A note? Just a note? That's... not really the same, is it? It’s not about the words, Doctor, it's about the thought. My sister's doctor, he understands. He sends a card. A real card. With a flower. This is… disappointing, frankly. I thought you would be more… considerate. You're a doctor! It should come naturally.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I sincerely apologize that I haven't met your expectations. I understand your disappointment, and I truly regret that I am unable to fulfill your request for a card. I want to assure you that it’s not a matter of lacking consideration, but rather that my practice is focused on providing medical care. Offering cards isn't something I currently provide. I can appreciate that this is important to you, and I apologize for causing you frustration. I am happy to spend a few more moments talking with you and ensuring you feel heard and understood. Perhaps we can discuss some resources for emotional wellbeing, if you'd like?
PATIENT: Resources? Emotional wellbeing? Honestly, Doctor, you are missing the point entirely! It's not about needing resources, it's about common decency. My sister, she doesn't need resources, her doctor just sends a card! It's a small gesture, a little kindness! You’re making this so complicated. I think… I think I’ve wasted my time here. It's perfectly clear you don't understand. I’ll just… I’ll just go.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand your frustration, and I apologize again for not being able to meet your expectations. I can see this is very important to you. While I am unable to provide a card, I want to assure you that I value your feelings and I've listened to your concerns. I wish you all the best and hope you find the reassurance you're seeking. Please be careful as you leave. .
