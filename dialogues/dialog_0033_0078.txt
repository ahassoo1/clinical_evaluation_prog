DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, you know? I’m not sick, exactly. Just…not thriving. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what that means and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," you say. Hmm. And how long have you been feeling this…lack of thriving?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It’s not sudden, not at all. Probably…the last six months, maybe a year? It’s crept up on me, I think. It's hard to pinpoint. Everything just feels…heavier, if that makes sense. Less energy, less…enthusiasm for things.
DOCTOR: Six months to a year. Alright. And is this "heaviness" constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are…better than others. But the “good” days are fewer and further between, I've noticed. It seems to be worse when I'm very busy, or when the weather is gloomy. Though, honestly, even on a beautiful day, it can still be there. It's…unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable. And can you describe what this feels like physically?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. It's not pain, not really. More…a dragging sensation. A tiredness that doesn’t get better with sleep. And…sometimes my muscles feel a little bit achey, especially in my shoulders and back. But honestly, the biggest part is just…feeling weighed down. Like I'm moving through molasses, you know? It’s hard to explain. It's not one specific thing.
DOCTOR: Molasses, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My appetite has been…off. Some days I don't feel hungry at all, and other days I just don't enjoy food the way I used to. And, well, I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not a lot, but enough that my clothes feel a bit looser. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, though, so I can’t give you a specific number.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulties with sleep other than just not feeling rested?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep. My mind just races, you know? Thinking about everything. And when I do fall asleep, I don't always sleep soundly. I wake up a few times during the night, and sometimes it’s hard to get back to sleep. It’s not every night, but it’s…frequent enough to be bothersome. Do you want me to be more specific? Perhaps times?
DOCTOR: No, no, that's sufficient. Any changes in bowel habits, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, yes, a little. Things aren’t…as regular as they used to be. More constipated, if I’m being honest. I haven't had any major problems, but it's definitely something I've noticed. Is that…concerning? I don't want to burden you with too many details.
DOCTOR: It's information. Let's move on. Any recent stressful life events?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, my daughter, Sofia, she just started university. Which is wonderful, of course! But…sending her away was…difficult. And my husband, Ricardo, he's been working longer hours lately. It's…a lot of change. Not bad change, necessarily, but a lot nonetheless. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm adjusting to a new normal, and it's…exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I prefer to avoid them if I can, honestly. I’ve always been…quite healthy, generally. Just this…sluggishness is new. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Really. No prescriptions, no regular over-the-counter medications. Is that a problem? I've heard…things. About side effects.
DOCTOR: No, not a problem. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. No fever, no chills, no night sweats. I haven’t been sick at all. It’s just…this feeling of being…drained. It's frustrating, honestly. I feel like I should be able to just…snap out of it, but I can’t. And I worry about what it could be. I don't want to bother you with frivolous complaints if it’s just…old age. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Alright. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are regular. Abdomen…soft. Blood pressure is 128/78. Anything else you've been neglecting to mention?
PATIENT: Oh…well, now that you ask… I have been feeling a little more forgetful lately. Just small things, like misplacing my glasses or forgetting appointments. I thought it was just…stress. And maybe…a little bit of anxiety, with Sofia being away at school. But it has been happening more frequently, I suppose. Is that…serious? I really do try to keep a good routine, but this…It’s like my brain is just…foggy sometimes. And it’s embarrassing, honestly. I used to have a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you are experiencing a bit of generalized stress. Likely related to your daughter starting university and adjustment to a new routine. I recommend ensuring adequate sleep, regular exercise, and a balanced diet. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to reassess if things haven’t improved. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Well…yes, I suppose. But…is that all it is? I just…I feel like it’s more than that. I'm worried about something deeper. But…if you think a month is sufficient, then yes, I’ll schedule a follow-up. I don't want to be a burden. Though…could we perhaps order some blood work, just to rule things out? Vitamin deficiencies, thyroid…something? I just want to be thorough. If you think it's unnecessary, though, I trust your judgment. It's just… I want to feel like we’re addressing everything.
DOCTOR: Fine. I will order a basic metabolic panel and a TSH. But I highly doubt it will reveal anything significant. And please, try to manage your stress levels. It’s the most likely culprit. The lab results will be available in a few days. I will have the nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up. Any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Thank you…for your time. I appreciate you ordering the tests, even if you don’t think they’ll be helpful. I will try to manage my stress. I really will. And thank you for…listening, I suppose. I suppose I will see you in a month, then. Thank you again. .
