DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Benic, is it?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Aurthur Benic. Though most folks just call me Aurthur. Good to meet ye, Doctor... Gorga, was it?
DOCTOR: Gorka, yes. Craig Gorka. And please, call me Craig. Now, what brings you in today, Aurthur?
PATIENT: Well, it’s been this nausea, see? Every mornin', without fail. It's not sharp, more like a queasy feelin’ that just sits in me stomach. And I've got... well, the nurse explained I’ve got a bit of a weak heart, and I was wonderin' if that could be somethin’ to do with it? It just feels a bit different than a regular bug, if ye ken what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right, yes…weak heart, some congestion noted. Nausea every morning…Okay. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I reckon. Started off now and again, just a bit off, but it's been pretty consistent for the last week. It doesn’t seem to be gettin’ worse, exactly, just… there. It’s not stoppin’ me from doin’ things, but it's definitely a nuisance. Especially first thing, ye know? Makes me no’ want to get out o’ bed.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… consistent for the last week… Alright. Any vomiting with the nausea?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Just the queasy feelin’. And a bit of a loss o’ appetite, sometimes. I can usually manage a bit o’ toast and a cup o’ tea, but I don't fancy much more than that in the mornin’. Not like I used to, anyway. Used to have a proper breakfast, I did. Bacon, eggs, the whole shebang.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that ye mention it, aye, a wee bit. Not really different, just… less. I used to be quite regular, if ye ken what I mean, but it's slowed down a bit since this started. No pain or anything, just… less frequent. Does that make sense? I dinna want to bore ye with details...
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s helpful information, Aurthur. Thank you. Now, do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Well, I get a wee bit breathless when I’m walkin’ uphill, but I always put that down to me age and, well, the heart, like the nurse said. And me ankles swell up a bit at the end o' the day, if I've been on me feet a lot. I wear support stockings now, and that seems to help. Other than that… not really. I sleep alright, mostly. And no chest pain, which I’m grateful for.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, ankle swelling… Alright. Now, do you take any medications at all, Aurthur?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. I take… let me see… I've got these water tablets, Furosemide, I think it's called, to get rid o' some o' the extra fluid. And I take Ramipril, that’s for me blood pressure, and... and some Bisoprolol, a beta-blocker, the doctor told me. I try to remember to take them all at the same time each mornin’. It’s a bit o’ a faff, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, Furosemide, Ramipril, Bisoprolol… Good. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve ever known of. I've had the usual childhood things, measles and what have ye, but nothing serious. I can eat anything, thankfully. I dinna hold much truck with fancy foods, mind ye, but I can tolerate most things. And no reactions to any of these pills either, thankfully. I'm a fairly simple man, really. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just a few quick questions about your past health. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything else besides your heart condition?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Oh! When I was a young lad, maybe 10 or 12, I broke me arm fallin’ oot o’ a tree. Spent a couple o’ days in the hospital gettin’ it set. Other than that… nothin’ much. A few bouts o’ the flu, a bad cold now and again, but nothin’ that required a stay in the hospital. I've been quite lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone in your family had any significant health problems?
PATIENT: Aye, me father, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure as well. And me mother, she suffered from arthritis in her later years. She was a strong woman, but it slowed her down something terrible. And me sister… she had a touch o’ diabetes, but she managed to keep it under control with diet and exercise. Other than that… nothin’ that I can recall. It’s a fairly healthy family, generally. Though, mind ye, folk dinna live as long as they used to back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Aurthur. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen, if that's alright. And I'll take your blood pressure and pulse again.
PATIENT: Aye, that’s grand. Go right ahead, Doctor. I've no objections at all. Just tell me if ye need me to do anything. I'm quite used to it, mind ye. Been to the doctor quite a bit lately, as ye can imagine.
DOCTOR: Right, if you could lie back for me, please. Deep breath in… and out…Good. Let’s listen to your heart first. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, as expected. Some trace edema present. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Blood pressure is 140/85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Okay, Aurthur. Everything seems relatively stable, but the nausea is concerning given your heart condition. It could be a side effect of the medications, or it could be a sign of something else.
PATIENT: Aye, well, I'm glad to hear nothin’ major’s wrong. But this queasy feelin’… it’s just wearin’ me down a bit. Could it be… I dinna ken, something to do with the water tablets? I read somewhere that they can sometimes upset your stomach. Or maybe I’m just gettin’ old. Is there anythin’ ye’d recommend, Doctor? Anythin’ I can take to settle it? Or should I just grin and bear it?
DOCTOR: It could very well be a side effect of the Furosemide, yes. It's not uncommon. We can try a few things. I'm going to order some blood work to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels, just to make sure everything's okay. We’ll also check your thyroid, as that can sometimes cause nausea. In the meantime, try eating smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid anything greasy or spicy. And I’ll prescribe you an anti-nausea medication, just to take as needed. If the nausea gets worse, or if you start vomiting, please come back right away. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough. Smaller meals, less grease… I can manage that. And an anti-nausea pill… that'd be a blessin’, to be honest. I'm glad ye’re takin’ it seriously, Doctor. I dinna want to be a bother, but it's just… it’s affectin’ me quality o’ life a wee bit, ye ken? And the blood work… I suppose that’s just to be on the safe side? No need to worry too much, I hope?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Aurthur, just to be on the safe side. It’s important to rule out any other potential causes. And no, there's no need to worry too much. We’re just being thorough. I'll write you a prescription for the anti-nausea medication, and a lab order for the blood work. The nurse will give you instructions on where to go to get that done. We’ll review the results when they come back, and see if we need to adjust your medications. If the nausea doesn't improve after a week, or if you develop any new symptoms, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers most o' it, Doctor. Thank ye kindly for takin' the time to listen to me, and for not dismissin' it as just old age. I appreciate it. Smaller meals, anti-nausea pills… I’ll give it a try. I suppose I’ll just be gettin' on with it then. Aye. Thank ye again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aurthur. Glad I could help. Just take it easy, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. The nurse will see you out with the paperwork. Take care now.
