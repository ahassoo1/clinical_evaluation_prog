DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Todoro… Todoro-vich, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s… hard to say exactly. I just… I find myself sighing a lot these days. Deep breaths, you know? Not painful, just… a lot. My wife, she used to say I sighed like an old teak tree in the wind. But she’s… gone now. It just feels like it’s happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Sighing… Okay. And when did you start noticing this increase in sighing?
PATIENT: Increase…? Oh dear. That’s a good question. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Hmm… maybe… after the funeral? Or maybe a little before. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. It wasn’t sudden, not like a shock. Just… gradual. Like the sun setting, you know? Slow and quiet. I don’t… I don’t really keep track of dates much anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. So, roughly around the time of your wife’s passing. And besides the sighing, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… anything else? Let me think… Well, I sleep a lot more these days. Not restless sleep, just… long naps. And I don’t… I don’t have much of an appetite anymore. Everything tastes… muted. Not bad, just… not much flavor. And sometimes… sometimes I just feel… empty. Like a hollow drum. But that could just be… well, you know. Losing my wife. It’s… a big thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased sleep, decreased appetite, and feeling… empty. And you're not experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness with these sighs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no pain. Not at all. And no… no shortness of breath. I can still walk to the market, you know. Slowly, perhaps. But I can do it! And dizziness… not really. Sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded when I stand up too fast, but that’s just my old legs, I think. I used to be a strong man, you know. A policeman. Lots of running and chasing. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… bowel habits? Well… now you’re asking! Let me see… It's… irregular. Sometimes… fine. Sometimes… not so fine. It's not painful, not usually. Just… different. I used to be very regular, you know. Like clockwork. But things change when you get old, don’t they? Everything gets… loose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… no, no. Not really. I had some pills for my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said I didn't need them anymore. Something about it going down. Now I just… drink a lot of water. And sometimes a little herbal tea. My daughter, she sends me some from the city. It’s… nice. But that’s all. No fancy medicines for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… hospital? Hmm. Let me think… Yes, yes, I broke my arm once. When I was a young policeman. Chasing a thief. A foolish thing, really. And… and I had a bad fever when I was a boy. Very high fever. My mother, she nursed me back to health. But other than that… no. Not really. I've been a very healthy man, you know. Until recently.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No surgeries. I always avoided them if I could. My wife, she had her appendix out once, but I… I never needed anything like that. I always believed in letting the body heal itself, you know? A bit of rest, a bit of herbal tea, and a good night's sleep. That's what always worked for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my father… he lived a long life, I think. Farming, you know. Hard work. My mother, she was very strong too. Lots of children. My older brother… he had problems with his heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. And my sister… she died young, from a sickness. I don't remember much about it, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and I was just a boy. Not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, you said your wife passed away?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, my wife. She… she went last year. It was… peaceful, thankfully. But I miss her terribly, you know? We were together for… oh, a long, long time. She was the strong one, always looking after me. Now… now it's just quiet. Too quiet. That’s probably why I’m sighing so much. Just… missing her.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will just be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Nothing too invasive. It’s just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My old bones aren't as strong as they used to be, you know. But I'll manage. Just let me know if I need any help.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please. Heart sounds are… regular rate, slightly diminished. No murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. My lungs… I used to be a very strong swimmer, you know. But that was a long time ago. The air… it doesn’t feel as easy as it used to.
DOCTOR: Breath sounds are… diminished bilaterally with mild scattered wheezes. No crackles or rhonchi appreciated. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, with mild tenderness to palpation in all quadrants. No organomegaly or masses appreciated. Okay. That's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. It wasn’t too bad. So… what do you think? Is it something serious? My daughter, she worries about me, you know. She sends me all sorts of herbal remedies. But I don't want to bother her if it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Vantine, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of things. The sighing, decreased appetite, sleep changes, and feelings of emptiness are likely related to grief after the loss of your wife. That’s perfectly normal, and it can take a long time to process. However, the diminished breath sounds and mild wheezing suggest some underlying mild lung issues – potentially early COPD or simply age-related changes. The tenderness in your abdomen could be due to a variety of things, but it doesn’t seem to be anything acutely concerning at this time. Given your age and history, I would like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We should also run a basic blood panel to check your overall health and rule out any underlying deficiencies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… X-rays and blood panels… It all sounds a bit… much. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then I suppose. I don’t want to be a bother, you know. And I don’t want to worry my daughter unnecessarily. So… yes. Yes, alright. Let’s do the X-ray and the blood panel. Whatever you need. Just… try not to poke me too much, alright? My old bones are very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write the orders for the X-ray and bloodwork now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. The X-ray technician will explain everything. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay hydrated and try to maintain a balanced diet, even if you don’t have much of an appetite. And don't hesitate to lean on your support system – your daughter, friends, anyone who can offer you some comfort. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh… questions? Hmm… Not really, I suppose. Just… will the X-ray hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? My daughter, she's always asking about these things. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It’s… nice to talk to someone about it. Even if it’s just about sighing and X-rays.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself shouldn't hurt at all – it's just a brief exposure to radiation. The technician will position you correctly. As for the results, it usually takes a couple of days for them to come back. We'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as we have them. And you’re welcome. Alright, well, I think that covers everything. You can head down to the lab now. Let me know if you have any trouble finding it.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I'll try not to worry my daughter too much. And I'll go find this lab now. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you again. For listening to an old man sigh.
