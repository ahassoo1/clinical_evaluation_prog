DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Burlingham. Thank you. Well, I requested to come in… it’s about getting tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now.
DOCTOR: HIV testing, alright. It’s… good you’re being proactive, I suppose. Though frankly, at your age, it's not something one generally thinks about. Still. Let's get some background. Have you had any reason to be concerned recently?
PATIENT: Concerned… not exactly, no. It’s more… preventative, really. My husband and I… we haven’t been as careful as we should be lately, and I just want to be sure. It’s better to know, isn’t it? And I’ve heard stories… you can’t always tell if something is wrong.
DOCTOR: "Better to know," yes, that's what people say. Though sometimes, people create worry where none needs to be. Still, we’ll proceed. You said you and your husband haven’t been…as careful. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Well… we haven’t been using protection as consistently as we used to. It’s been… a long marriage, Doctor. Things… change. We thought, after all these years, the risk was low. Perhaps foolishly. Is that… is that enough information? I don’t really like discussing these things.
DOCTOR: "Things change," yes. That's often the case. And while length of marriage can be a factor, it certainly doesn’t eliminate risk entirely. It’s… responsible of you to finally address this, though frankly, it should have been addressed sooner. Now, have either of you had any other partners recently?
PATIENT: Other partners? No, absolutely not. My husband and I have been together for… forty-two years. We’ve never… I mean, we've both been faithful. That’s a rather…impertinent question, Doctor, with all due respect. I only came to be tested because of a lapse in… precautions, not because of any infidelity.
DOCTOR: Please don’t misunderstand, Ms. Shaub. I am simply gathering a complete history. It’s standard procedure. A thorough assessment is crucial for accurate testing and understanding potential exposures. It’s not an accusation, simply due diligence. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but nothing a good cream can’t handle. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but it’s usually manageable with diet. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… well, quite some time, truthfully. I tend to avoid them when I can.
DOCTOR: “Avoid them when you can,” yes, a common sentiment. However, regular check-ups are vital, Ms. Shaub. Especially with elevated blood pressure. Do you know what your readings usually are?
PATIENT: Honestly, no, not precisely. My daughter checks it occasionally when she visits, but I rarely pay attention to the numbers. She says it’s usually around… 140 over 90, maybe? But that was a while ago, and she always worries, so it could be higher. I don’t feel unwell, Doctor. That’s what matters, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Feeling unwell is not always indicative of a problem, Ms. Shaub. Hypertension is often asymptomatic. 140 over 90 is certainly elevated and requires attention. We’ll need to address that, along with your request for HIV testing. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knees, and that’s just over-the-counter. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I prefer to avoid them if possible. Too many side effects, you know? I try to manage things naturally.
DOCTOR: “Manage things naturally.” Right. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not even as a child. I used to eat everything, really! My mother always said I had an iron stomach. Though, now that I think about it… I did get a bit of a rash once, years ago, after eating some shellfish, but I assumed it was just the shellfish. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: A rash after shellfish could indicate an allergy. We’ll make a note of that. Alright, Ms. Shaub, let's proceed with a physical exam. It will be rather basic, focusing on vital signs and a general assessment. Then we can discuss the HIV testing process and schedule it accordingly. If you would kindly follow me…
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub, if you would please lie back. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Now, please remain still and try to relax.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s always a bit daunting being in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 150 over 95, Ms. Shaub. As you can see, it's significantly elevated. Your heart sounds are regular, but a bit rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a bit… startling. My reflexes aren't what they used to be, I suppose. I haven't been very active lately. My knees, you know. Everything else feels alright, though.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are diminished, Ms. Shaub, but within expected range for your age and activity level. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Oh, um… a little bit here, on the left side. Not much, really. Just… a bit uncomfortable. It’s probably nothing. I get a bit of indigestion sometimes. It’s probably just gas.
DOCTOR: Indigestion, you say. And how often do you experience this discomfort, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. It’s usually after I eat something… rich, I suppose. Or if I’m a bit stressed. Nothing that a bit of antacid can’t handle. I don’t pay it much attention, really. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Concerned is perhaps too strong a word, Ms. Shaub. However, your blood pressure is significantly elevated and warrants further investigation. And the discomfort in your left abdomen, while potentially minor, needs to be assessed. Now, regarding your request for HIV testing… we can proceed with that, but I recommend we also run some additional blood work to evaluate your overall health. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. If it will help… then yes, please. I just want to know what’s going on. Everything sounds very serious all of a sudden. Is it… is it something I should be very worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something to be panicked about, Ms. Shaub. However, ignoring elevated blood pressure and unexplained abdominal discomfort is not advisable. We need to gather more information before we can determine the cause and appropriate course of action. The additional blood work will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and allow us to rule out any potential underlying issues. Now, let's discuss the HIV testing process itself. It involves a simple blood draw, and the results will be available in approximately one to two weeks. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… the waiting. One to two weeks seems a long time. What if… what if it's positive? What happens then?
DOCTOR: If the results are positive, Ms. Shaub, it means you have been infected with the HIV virus. It is not a death sentence, as it once was. With proper treatment, which includes antiretroviral medications, you can live a long and healthy life. We would immediately refer you to an HIV specialist who will discuss treatment options with you in detail. They will also provide support and counseling. It’s important to remember that early detection and treatment are key. Now, let's focus on getting the tests done. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a comprehensive plan for your health. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s… a lot to take in. I guess… let’s just get the tests done. The sooner we know, the better, right?
DOCTOR: That’s the spirit, Ms. Shaub. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can address any concerns and create a plan for your health. My nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. I will also write a referral to a specialist, just in case. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been very… reassuring. I’ll just wait here, then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. I'll leave you to it. Please make yourself comfortable.
PATIENT: .
