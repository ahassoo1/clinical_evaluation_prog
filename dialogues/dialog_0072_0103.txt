DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 77 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 77, that’s right. It’s my back, you see. My low back. It’s been hurting for… oh, a good while now. Not sudden, not from a fall or anything. Just… achey. And getting worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, an achey lower back that’s been developing over time. I understand. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not sharp, not like a stabbing pain. More like a… dull weight. Like someone is sitting on me, but gently. And it’s worse when I stand for too long, or when I try to bend over. Sitting isn’t so bad, actually, if I have a good chair. But getting up from the chair… that’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: A dull weight that worsens with standing and bending, and is difficult to get up from a seated position. That gives me a little more to work with. And when did you first start noticing this pain, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started… maybe six, seven months ago? It was just a little thing then, I barely noticed it. I thought it was just old age, you know? But it’s been slowly getting worse each month. I didn’t think much of it at first, but now… well, now it’s hard to do things. Like gardening. I love my garden.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it began gradually about six or seven months ago and has progressively worsened to the point where it’s impacting your activities, specifically your gardening. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I have. My daughter, bless her heart, she told me to try some of those… what are they called… creams? The kind you rub on? They helped a little, for maybe an hour. And I’ve been taking… oh, what’s the name… the white pills. For aches and pains. They take the edge off, but they don't really fix it. I don’t like taking too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Topical creams and over-the-counter pain relievers, with limited and temporary relief. I understand your reluctance to take a lot of medication. Do you recall the name of the pain reliever you’ve been taking?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… it’s… the bottle is in the kitchen. It’s… a white bottle. With blue writing. Oh, what was I thinking? It’s… Tylenol, I think. Yes, Tylenol. The extra strength kind. I take two, maybe three times a day when it’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tylenol extra strength as needed. Now, aside from your back pain, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Not really… I’m a little tired, maybe? But I’m 77, Doctor. Everyone is a little tired. And my bones… they feel a little brittle, I guess. My daughter says I’m stooping over more. She worries about me falling. I haven't had a fall, thankfully. Just… feeling a little fragile, you know?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and a sense of fragility, with your daughter noting increased stooping. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. No tingling. My legs are okay. A little weak maybe, when I get up from the chair, but that’s just getting old, isn't it? And my feet… they’re fine. I can walk okay. I just don’t walk as far as I used to.
DOCTOR: No numbness, tingling, or weakness in the extremities. Reduced walking tolerance. Now, Mr. Vankampen, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see... Hmm. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? And I had high blood pressure for a while, but they put me on pills for that, and it's been okay. I don't see the doctor much, to be honest. I used to, but... well, things change, you know? Oh, and my daughter tells me I have something called… osteoporosis? She said it weakens the bones.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, hypertension, and your daughter mentioned osteoporosis. Do you know when you were diagnosed with the osteoporosis, or what treatment, if any, you've been receiving for it?
PATIENT: I don’t remember being diagnosed, Doctor. My daughter, she took me to the doctor a few years back. She handles all the paperwork and stuff. She told me about the osteoporosis then, said I needed to be careful. I think she gave me some pills to take, but I stopped taking them. They upset my stomach. She wasn’t happy about that, but they really bothered me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a past diagnosis of osteoporosis with discontinued medication due to gastrointestinal side effects. Now, Mr. Vankampen, have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don’t think so. Nothing else. Just the gallbladder. I had that done at the hospital… oh, a long time ago. It’s been a long life, you know? I try to stay out of hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history... Let me think. My mother, she had bad arthritis in her hands. Real bad. She couldn’t knit anymore, poor woman. And my father... he had a bad back too, when he got older. He used to work on the farm, heavy lifting all the time. He always said it was the lifting that ruined his back. That’s about it, really. No one else I can think of with any major problems.
DOCTOR: And finally, Mr. Vankampen, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I live alone now. My wife… she passed away a few years back. I keep busy. I garden, when I can. I read. I watch TV. I go to church on Sundays. I don’t smoke. Never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but not much anymore. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. Not much red meat.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vankampen. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to hurt. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to have you stand, if you're able, and I'd like to observe your posture and how you walk. Then I'll examine your back while you're standing, and then have you lie down so I can check your range of motion and assess for any tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. I can stand. It might be a little slow, but I can do it. Just be careful, alright? And please, tell me if I’m doing something wrong. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting a slight forward stoop and some hesitation in your gait. Now, if you could turn around a bit, I'd like to examine your back while you’re standing. I’ll gently palpate along your spine and muscles to assess for tenderness or any abnormalities. Please let me know if anything is painful. <stage>I begin a gentle palpation of his lower back, starting at the midline and moving laterally. "Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little there. On the left side. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. It’s always been a little tender there, but it’s worse now. And… a little higher up. There too.
DOCTOR: And what about when you bend forward?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s not good. It’s… a tight pain. Right in the middle of my back. It’s hard to get down. And even harder to get back up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Now I'm going to assess your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Just relax, and let me know if you feel anything unusual.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just tell me what you want me to do. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Your reflexes and sensation appear normal. I'm also not noting any significant swelling or tenderness in your legs. Now, I'm going to perform a straight leg raise test to assess for any nerve impingement. Just let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg.
PATIENT: Ooh! That… that’s a little uncomfortable. Not sharp, but… a pulling sensation. Down the back of my leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… yeah, down the back of my leg.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. That completes the physical examination.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't so bad. But what does it all mean, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Based on your history and the physical examination findings – your lower back pain that's been developing over time, the tenderness to palpation, limited range of motion, and the positive straight leg raise test – it appears you are experiencing a lumbar radiculopathy, likely caused by a compression of a nerve root in your lower back. This is often due to age-related changes in the spine, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. It's not an emergency, but it's something we need to address. This explains the pain radiating down your leg, which is what the positive straight leg raise test indicates. It's also not uncommon given your age and history of osteoporosis. We can confirm this with imaging, such as an MRI, but given your symptoms, it is likely this is the diagnosis.
PATIENT: MRI? Is that… expensive? And what does that mean? Compression… that sounds bad. Will I need surgery?
DOCTOR: An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a scan that allows us to visualize the structures in your lower back, including the nerves and discs. It's the best way to confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact cause of the compression. As for the cost, that's a good question. Given that you are uninsured, we can discuss options for financial assistance or a more affordable facility. I’ll have my office staff work with you on that. Now, regarding the compression… in many cases, it’s caused by age-related changes or a small disc bulge. It doesn't always require surgery. The vast majority of patients improve with conservative treatment, which includes physical therapy, pain management, and lifestyle modifications. We'll start with that. We'll try these measures first before even discussing surgery. We're a long way from needing surgery, Mr. Vankampen. However, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve with conservative treatment, then we would discuss imaging and potential surgical options. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: So… no surgery right away? That’s good. Physical therapy… I can do that. I don't like taking pills, you know. And what about this osteoporosis? Does that have anything to do with it? And… how long will this therapy take? I’m not very good with long treatments. My wife… she had to go to therapy for months.
DOCTOR: That's right, no surgery right away. We'll start with physical therapy to strengthen your core muscles, improve your posture, and reduce the pressure on the nerve. And you're right to ask about the osteoporosis. It certainly contributes to the problem. The weakened bones make the spine more susceptible to compression and injury, and it increases your risk of developing a herniated disc. Regarding the length of treatment, it varies. Typically, we start with a course of 6-8 weeks of physical therapy, but that can be adjusted based on your progress. We’ll regularly reassess your condition and tailor the treatment plan accordingly. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach. We'll also discuss medication options for pain management, although I understand your reluctance. We can start with a non-opioid pain reliever and see if that provides adequate relief. If not, we can explore other options, but we'll avoid stronger medications if possible. We can also discuss options for managing the osteoporosis, such as calcium and vitamin D supplements. For now, I'm going to write a prescription for a non-opioid pain reliever, and a referral for physical therapy. I will also have my office staff schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Not too much at once, you know? And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I don’t understand all the medical words, but you make it easier. And… thank you for not talking about surgery right away. That’s a relief. I guess… I guess I'll try the therapy. And I’ll take the pills, if I have to. Just… not too many, alright? Is there anything else I need to do? Or know?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I'm glad I could clarify things. And yes, just remember to take the pain reliever as directed, and attend your physical therapy appointments. It's important to be consistent with the therapy, even if you don't feel immediate relief. It takes time to strengthen the muscles and improve your posture. I will also give you a handout with some exercises you can do at home to supplement your physical therapy. And it's important to avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as numbness, weakness, or loss of bowel or bladder control, please contact my office immediately. Those would be signs of a more serious problem, and we would need to investigate further. Finally, my office staff will help you with the insurance paperwork and schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very well. I appreciate your patience. And thank you again for not rushing things. I guess… I guess I’ll see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and remember to listen to your body. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. We’ll see how you’re progressing in two weeks. Have a good day.
