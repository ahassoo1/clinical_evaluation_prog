DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Uh… it’s my chest. It hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts sometimes. It’s… in my chest, like where a woman… where a lady would… you know. It's weird.
DOCTOR: I understand. Chest pain can be concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's helpful you can point to the general area. To help me understand a little better, could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Okay. It's not… sharp. More like… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like… fullness? Like it's… heavy. And it's not like a muscle pain. I do a lot of work on roofs, you know? It's not that kind of sore. It comes and goes. Mostly… mostly it's just uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache, a feeling of fullness or heaviness, and not related to muscle strain. That's helpful. And you mentioned it comes and goes. Roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? A little more than a month, I think. At first it was just… a little thing. I didn't even worry about it. But then… it started happening more often. And it felt… different. More noticeable. Now it's… well, that's why I'm here. I don't know what to think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been approximately a month, starting subtle and gradually increasing in frequency and intensity. That's good information. Has anything specifically brought it on that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I work hard. Lots of lifting, moving around. But it doesn't seem to be worse after work. Or better after resting. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m just sitting. Sometimes when I'm walking. There's no… nothing I can point to that makes it start. It's random. It's a little scary, actually. I don't get sick much. So this feels… new.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bulaong. It's good you're paying attention to this new symptom. Since it’s not consistently linked to activity, that does change things. To get a better picture, let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. I've always been pretty healthy. I eat okay, mostly. My wife cooks good food. And I try to stay active, even with the work. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just… cuts and scrapes from the roof. Nothing like this. I don't take any pills or anything. I don't even like taking medicine if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No prior medical diagnoses and no current medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had any surgeries. Nothing. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but it healed on its own. Just a cast for a few weeks. Other than that… nothing. I try to be careful. But roofs are dangerous, you know? But I'm good. I haven't been hurt bad. Just… this chest pain now. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just a childhood broken arm that healed well. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family – your parents, siblings, grandparents – has anyone in your family had any heart problems, chest pain, or early heart attacks?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My… my father, he had high blood pressure, I think. My wife told me. He didn't take care of himself very well. He smoked a lot. And he… he had a stroke, maybe ten years ago? He's okay now, but… he's not very active. And my mother… she’s good. Never had any problems. As far as I know, no one else in the family had chest pain like this. It's… hard to say, you know? We don't talk about health much. Everyone keeps to themselves.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bulaong. Knowing what you do know is helpful. So, your father had high blood pressure and a stroke, and your mother has been healthy. And no one else specifically with chest pain or heart problems that you're aware of. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. None of that. I don’t drink. Never liked it. And I don’t smoke. Smells bad, and my wife doesn’t like it. And I don't… I don't do any of those other things. I just work. And spend time with my wife. We go to church on Sundays. That's it. Pretty simple life. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Bulaong. It sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle overall. Now, to get a better sense of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's wrong. I trust you. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. But if you need to poke and listen… go ahead.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bulaong. I appreciate your trust. I’ll do my best to figure out what's going on. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then I’ll feel your chest and back to check for any tenderness. And I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your chest wall is not particularly tender to the touch. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good? I don’t know what any of that means, but… good. Is something wrong? What do you think it is? It still hurts a little, right here.
DOCTOR: Those findings are generally reassuring, Mr. Bulaong. However, the fact that you're still experiencing discomfort is important. Given your symptoms – the dull ache, the feeling of fullness, and the lack of tenderness on palpation – and considering your normal vital signs, it could be a few things. It could be musculoskeletal pain, but since it’s not consistently related to activity, that's less likely. It's also possible it could be related to acid reflux or heartburn, even if you don't experience typical burning symptoms. But to rule out anything more serious, like a cardiac issue, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don’t like tests. Are they expensive? I don’t have… insurance. My wife and I… we haven’t been able to afford it. If it costs a lot of money, I don't know what we’ll do. I just want to know what’s wrong, but… I don’t want to get into trouble with money. What kind of tests are you thinking about? And how much will they cost?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Bulaong, and I understand your hesitation. I wouldn't recommend anything if it wasn't potentially helpful. The tests I'm considering are a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function, and an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – to check the electrical activity of your heart. It’s a simple, painless test where we put stickers on your chest. Regarding cost, I understand you don’t have insurance. Let me see what the self-pay rates are for these tests. The blood panel would be approximately $75, and the EKG around $150. I can also see if there are any assistance programs available through the clinic or local hospitals that might help cover some of the cost. We can also discuss prioritizing just the EKG first, as it's the more important test for ruling out a cardiac issue. What do you think?
PATIENT: $75 and $150… That's… a lot. But I guess… if it's to make sure my heart is okay, I guess we can do it. But I really don't want to get into debt. $225… We'll have to be careful. Okay. Let’s just do the heart test first. The EKG. If that’s okay. And maybe you can tell me more about those… assistance programs? My wife is good with money. She can look into it. But let's start with the heart test. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonable plan, Mr. Bulaong. Just the EKG for now. I’ll write the order for that, and we can get you set up in a few minutes. The nurse will explain the procedure – it involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It takes about 10-15 minutes and is completely painless. I’ll also have the nurse provide you with information about the clinic’s financial assistance program and some local resources that may be able to help with the cost. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have. We’ll get through this together. Let me just finish this order, and I'll have the nurse come in to get you set up.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not making me do all the tests right away. And for looking into the money stuff. I just want to know what's wrong. I don’t want to worry my wife. I’ll trust you. Just let me know what I need to do. And I’ll try not to worry too much. It’s just… hard. Being old and things starting to hurt.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. It's my job to help you figure this out and alleviate your concerns. It’s completely understandable to be worried, and you're doing the right thing by getting it checked out. And you're not alone – it's perfectly normal to experience new symptoms as we get older. The nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to get you set up for the EKG. She will explain everything clearly and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think that’s everything. Just… let Maria come when she's ready. I'll just sit here and try to relax. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’ll leave you in Maria’s capable hands. Please don’t hesitate to let either of us know if you have any questions or concerns. .
