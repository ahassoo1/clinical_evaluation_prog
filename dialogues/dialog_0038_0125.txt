DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Jacquille. I'm Dr. Auelua. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I just… I want to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. My wife and I… we both just want to be sure. It’s better to know, right? Honestly, I don't see why anyone wouldn't get checked regularly. It’s responsible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jacquille. You're absolutely right – it is responsible, and it's fantastic that you and your wife are being proactive about this. It's much better to know, and regular testing is a really sensible approach. Okay, so you'd like to get tested for HIV. Just to clarify, have you had any specific concerns that led you to want testing now, or is this more of a routine check-up idea?
PATIENT: Concerns? No, not really. Nothing happened. It's just… well, you read about things, don’t you? People being careless. And honestly, you can’t trust everyone these days. It’s just… good preventative stuff, you know? My wife thought it was a good idea, and she's usually right. It’s not like I’m expecting anything, but… better safe than sorry. I mean, I haven’t done anything to worry about, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jacquille. It sounds like you're being very thoughtful and conscientious, and your wife is right – it is good preventative stuff. No concerns are needed to want to get tested – peace of mind is a perfectly valid reason. Okay. To get a good picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much to tell. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. A bit of a cold now and then, the usual. I have Medicare, so I get the yearly check-ups. Never been in hospital for anything serious. Just… normal stuff. My wife keeps telling me I should see a doctor more often, but I feel fine. I haven't got any… chronic illnesses or anything. I'm 32, you know? People my age don't usually have chronic illnesses.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy, Jacquille. It's great that you're keeping up with your yearly check-ups through Medicare. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalised, even for something minor?
PATIENT: No, never. Honestly, I’m telling you, nothing. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that's it. And that was in Nepal, ages ago. Not like proper hospitalisation, just a cast on for a few weeks. Everything else has been… normal. I'm a pretty careful person, Doctor. I don’t take risks. Honestly, I think my wife worries more than I do. She's always reading those things online.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalisations – just a broken arm as a child. That's helpful to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my parents are still alive, back in Nepal. They're… getting on a bit. My wife’s family is here, mostly. She’s got a sister and a brother. No one’s got anything… serious. Not that I know of. My wife's mum had high blood pressure, I think, but that’s it. Everyone’s pretty healthy, as far as I know. They all lead quiet lives, you know? Not like some of those families you hear about.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, parents healthy back in Nepal, wife's mum had high blood pressure, otherwise generally healthy family. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. I come home. I spend time with my wife. We eat healthy. I don’t smoke, I drink… occasionally. A beer with dinner sometimes. I’m a Compliance Officer, so I have to be… responsible. It’s not like I'm out partying every night, if that’s what you mean. I’m a pretty sensible person, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. So, you work as a Compliance Officer, you don't smoke, occasional alcohol consumption, and generally lead a healthy lifestyle. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks when she gives me painkillers, just in case, but I’m fine. I'm pretty robust, honestly. I eat everything. I’ve never had to avoid anything. A bit of dust sometimes, like everyone, but not a proper allergy. Really, I’m very healthy. You’re wasting your time asking, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t take anything. I told you, I’m fine. I don’t need anything. My wife keeps offering me vitamins, but I refuse. I get everything I need from my food. Honestly, I think doctors and pharmacies just make money off people worrying unnecessarily. I only go when I have to. Like today. And this is just a precaution, you understand. A sensible precaution.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all. Alright, Jacquille. It sounds like you're in very good health, and you're being very proactive about this testing. Now, to proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then we can do a blood test for HIV. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get it over with, honestly. The sooner I know, the better. I suppose a quick exam is fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have things to do, you know. Work doesn't just disappear just because I'm at the doctor. But yes, go ahead. Get it done. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It won't take long. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Then we'll take a small blood sample. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Good. Everything sounds clear. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is excellent. Now, open your mouth for me… Ah, throat looks clear. Ears look good as well. No swelling or redness. Everything seems normal so far.
PATIENT: Good. See? Perfectly healthy. I told you. Now, can we just get the blood test done? I don't like needles, you know. And the longer we sit here, the more nervous I’ll get. Just get it over with quickly, please. I’ve got things to do, Doctor. Important things. I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jacquille. You’re right to want to get it done quickly. I'll be as quick as possible. It will just be a small prick, and then we'll send the sample to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Just relax your arm for me… and here we go. It will be quick. There you go. All done. Just a little pressure for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. I'll put a bandage on it. The sample is now on its way to the lab. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will I hear back? A few days, you said? I hope it doesn’t take longer. And please, contact me directly. Don’t leave a message with my wife. She worries too much. Honestly, this whole thing is a bit of a nuisance, but I’m glad I’m doing it. Responsible, you know? Just get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be going now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jacquille. We'll contact you directly, and it should be within a few days. We understand your wife worries, so we will be sure to respect your request. It was good of you to come in today, and yes, you are being very responsible. If you experience any unusual symptoms in the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, Jacquille.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
