DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It's this… stuff. Coming up. All the time. Especially after I eat. It's just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: “Stuff” coming up… Alright. And you say especially after you eat?
PATIENT: Yeah, especially. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Though, rich foods… well, you can imagine. It’s just… revolting. And it happens when I lie down too. Makes a fella look bad, you know? My wife complains. Honestly, it's ruining my appetite. And a good appetite is important, don’t you think? I used to be a big eater.
DOCTOR: Yes, a good appetite is important. So, it’s happening after eating, when you lie down… is it a burning sensation, or more of a… regurgitation?
PATIENT: Regurgitation. That sounds fancy. It comes up. Like… well, like when you've had too much, you know? Not a burn. Just… food. Undigested food, sometimes. It’s disgusting, really. I haven’t had a proper night’s sleep in weeks. It's a nuisance, that's what it is. A real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, regurgitation, especially after meals and when lying down. And is it a large amount, or just a small amount?
PATIENT: It's not a little bit. It’s… significant. Enough to be… noticeable. I'm a tall man, you see. And a full stomach doesn't sit well with this. It's embarrassing! My wife makes me sleep propped up with pillows now. Pillows! A grown man, sleeping like a child. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, what do you think is causing this? You’re the doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Altine, there are several possibilities. It could be related to acid reflux, or possibly something to do with how your stomach is emptying. Have you noticed any heartburn or indigestion alongside this?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Not really. Maybe a little bit of… discomfort sometimes, but nothing major. I eat a good, solid meal. A man needs his food. I haven’t changed my diet. Always been a meat and potatoes kind of guy. Look, I don't want a lecture about changing my ways. I just want this… problem… fixed. Do you have a pill for it? Something quick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand you'd like a quick solution, but it's important to determine the cause of this before prescribing anything. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. I'm going to need to ask a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I could stand to lose a few pounds. But no, I haven't been losing weight. I eat heartily. A man of my stature needs to maintain his weight. Look, I’m a busy man, Dr. Nooruddin. I run an emergency management office, you know. I don’t have time for a lot of poking and prodding. Can’t you just give me something for it? Something to stop the… upchucking?
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I appreciate you explaining your schedule, however, dismissing this as simply “upchucking” isn’t appropriate and a physical exam is necessary to rule out anything serious. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. After that, I may want to order some bloodwork to get a clearer picture. Are you willing to allow me to proceed with the exam?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick, alright? I have a meeting this afternoon. And don't go poking around too much. I don't like being touched. Just get it over with. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. But my wife insisted I come. She always worries about everything. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could please lie back on the examination table, we’ll begin. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe deeply. I’m palpating your abdomen now. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. It seems slightly…distended. Are you regular with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Distended? What does that even mean? And what’s with all the questions? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to, alright? That's none of your business! And stop poking! You're making me uncomfortable. Honestly, I’ve had enough of this. If you can’t just give me a pill, what's the point? My wife is going to be furious if I'm here all day. Just… stop. I want to leave. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand you're frustrated, however, without a proper assessment, I cannot safely prescribe medication. Your refusal to cooperate makes it impossible to determine the cause of your symptoms. Given your symptoms and your resistance to a complete examination, I recommend you consult with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. I can provide you with a referral. .
