DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s... troublesome, really. I have been having a bit of difficulty breathing when I lie down flat. It’s not constant, but it’s worrying me. I don’t like feeling like I can’t get enough air.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing when lying flat… that is something we should look into. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. Just to clarify, Maribeth, does this happen every time you lie down, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent, yes. Not every time. Sometimes I can lie perfectly fine, other times… it feels like something is pressing on my chest. It’s hard to explain. It's not a pain, exactly. More like… a squeezing feeling and then I have to sit up to breathe comfortably.
DOCTOR: A squeezing feeling… alright. And how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It started… perhaps three months ago? Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t frequent at first, just once or twice a week. But lately, it’s been happening more often – almost every other night, I would say. It’s making it difficult to sleep, which is…unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, gradually worsening… and affecting your sleep. Have you noticed any other symptoms that happen at the same time as this difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my ankles have been a bit swollen lately. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest. And I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, but at my age, who isn't? It’s hard to say if that’s related, but I suppose it could be. I haven't noticed anything else particularly troubling.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and increased fatigue… alright, that’s good information. Now, Maribeth, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. I had high blood pressure for a time, but the doctor put me on medication and it’s been controlled for several years now. Other than that… nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant. I try to keep up with my check-ups, but things slip sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is good to know. And high blood pressure, well-controlled now… that is relevant. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it's a small white pill. The name… oh dear. It starts with an 'A', I believe. Amlodipine, is that right? Yes, Amlodipine. Five milligrams, if I remember correctly. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I haven’t changed the dose recently.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine 5mg, good. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been quite fortunate in that regard. I broke my wrist once as a child, but that's the extent of it. No major surgeries, no hospital stays. I try to stay active, you know? Walk every day, help out with the library… keeps me going. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Maribeth. Staying active is excellent. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Amlodipine?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. Nothing else. And I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for my arthritis if it's acting up, but that's not every day. Ibuprofen, I believe. A small dose, just when needed. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you understand. It makes me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most foods without issue. I can't recall ever having an allergic reaction to a medication either. I have sensitive skin, but that’s not an allergy, just…sensitive. It gets red easily. Nothing life-threatening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My mother… she had heart trouble later in life. She needed a pacemaker, eventually. And my father… he had diabetes. Nothing else springs to mind immediately. My brother is still living, quite healthy, as far as I know. We don’t see each other often, you understand. It’s…complicated. I suppose heart trouble is the main thing on my mother's side.
DOCTOR: Alright, heart trouble on your mother’s side, diabetes on your father’s side. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. Never will. I never took to smoking, and I haven’t had a drink of alcohol in…well, decades. I don't partake in any of that. I used to volunteer at the library, you know? It wouldn't do to have any… vices. It was important to be a good example. I drink plenty of water, that’s my beverage of choice.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. Thank you, Maribeth. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine, Doctor. I suppose it's necessary. Just… please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you understand. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's a relief to finally talk about this.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little fast, but not alarmingly so. I hear some mild crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 150/90. And yes, your ankles are somewhat swollen, with some pitting edema. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with some possible fluid retention and some congestion in your lungs. This could be related to your heart, especially given your mother’s history. It's not definitive, of course. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Yes, I suppose so. If it will help figure out what's wrong, then yes. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… tell me what it involves. I don’t like needles much, you understand. And how long will it take to get the results? I have a book club meeting next week, and I wouldn't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles. The blood work is fairly routine – just a few tubes of blood drawn from your arm. It will help us check your kidney function, electrolytes, and look for certain markers that can indicate heart problems. It's a standard procedure, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. As for the results, it usually takes about 2-3 business days for the lab to process everything. I should have them by early next week, well before your book club meeting. I will call you with the results as soon as I have them, or we can schedule another appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I also think it would be helpful to get an EKG, just to check your heart’s electrical activity. And potentially a chest x-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EKG and a chest x-ray… oh dear. More tests. Very well. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, I’ll do them. I just… I hope it's nothing too serious. I don't want to be a bother. I'll need to arrange transportation, you see. My grandson usually helps, but he’s busy with school. I suppose I can ask my neighbor. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any precautions I should take? Should I reduce my salt intake? I do enjoy my soup, you understand. I’ve always used a little salt.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about more tests. But these will give us a clearer picture and help us determine the best course of action. And yes, reducing your salt intake would be a good idea in the meantime. It can help reduce fluid retention. You don't need to eliminate salt entirely, but try to be mindful of it – avoid processed foods, limit the amount you add to your soup, and read labels carefully. Also, I’d recommend keeping a close eye on your symptoms. If you experience any shortness of breath at rest, dizziness, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll have the lab orders and EKG requisition ready for you. And I will write a note for your grandson explaining the tests and what to expect. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very considerate of you, Doctor. A note for my grandson would be most helpful. He worries about me, you see. So, just to be clear, reduce salt, watch for those symptoms – shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain – and wait for the test results. And you will call me? What’s the best number to reach you at? I have a landline, mostly. I don’t bother with those cell phones. I suppose that’s all for now, then. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. I appreciate it. I hope this doesn’t take too long to figure out. I have a quilting project I’d like to finish before winter.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Maribeth. I’m happy to help. The best number to reach you at is your landline, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. 555-123-4567. And please, don’t hesitate to call me if you think of anything else. I’d rather ask a question now than worry about it later. I believe that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. I shall take these instructions to heart – and try to reduce my salt intake. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. I will be sure to call you as soon as the results are available. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and have a good day. I hope you enjoy working on your quilting project.
