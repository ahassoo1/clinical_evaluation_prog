DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Right, Dr… Duplichan, is it? Honestly, I can’t really put my finger on it. My wife – well, she always handled these things. She said I needed to… optimise. Something about sleeping better and, I don’t know, not being a complete wreck all the time. She booked it, ages ago. Before… everything. So, I figured I’d just… see what you have to say. It's all a bit of a blur, really.
DOCTOR: “Optimise,” is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's what she said. Optimise. Like… fine-tuning, I suppose? She was always talking about peak performance. Always pushing me to… be better. It was exhausting, if I’m honest. Not that I’m complaining, now. Just… she had a knack for these things. And now I'm here, trying to figure out what she wanted me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's try to clarify what "optimise" means in your case. Perhaps we can start with a general overview of your current health. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not really. I mean, I get tired, obviously. But who doesn’t? And my back aches sometimes, but that’s just… getting old, I reckon. I tune pianos all day, bending over, reaching… it's not exactly a glamorous life. I wouldn't say anything's bothering me, per se. Just… not feeling quite right. Like a slightly out-of-tune instrument, maybe? Does that make sense? Probably not.
DOCTOR: It does, actually. And it's helpful. Let's try to be a bit more specific. You mentioned tiredness and back pain. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ages. Honestly, I couldn't put a date on it. Probably… since my wife got sick? It’s all a bit of a blur, like I said. Everything feels… muted, somehow. The tiredness is just… constant. And the back pain comes and goes. It flares up when I'm working on a particularly difficult piano, or if the weather's bad. It's just… life, I suppose. Not much to be done about it.
DOCTOR: “Just life” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Redfern. And we can do something about it, if there is something to be done. Let’s focus on the tiredness for a moment. Is it a fatigue that improves with rest?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate you trying to… diagnose me, or whatever it is you do. But I’m telling you, it's just tiredness. Normal tiredness. I work long hours, I’m not exactly young anymore. It doesn't really improve with rest, no. I sleep, or I lie in bed, and I wake up feeling just as… drained. Like the batteries are flat. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don't understand why we're dissecting this so thoroughly. My wife said "optimise", and here we are.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I understand your frustration. However, "tiredness" can be a symptom of many things, some of which are quite serious. To properly address your wife’s concern, and to rule out any underlying medical issues, I need more information. Can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day? Right. Well, I wake up… sometime. Usually before dawn. I have a coffee, then I go to the workshop. I tune pianos. All day. People bring them in, or I go to their houses. It's… fiddly work. Lots of bending, reaching, adjusting. Then I come home, have dinner, maybe watch some television. Go to bed. Repeat. It’s not exactly a thrilling existence, doctor. And I fail to see what any of this has to do with… optimising.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? Look, I eat. What do you want me to say? I'm not one of those fussy eaters. I have what’s on offer. Sometimes my neighbor brings over leftovers, which is nice. I don't really pay much attention to what I'm eating. It's fuel, isn't it? Keeps me going. I suppose I have coffee with breakfast, and sometimes a sandwich for lunch. Dinner varies. Really, doctor, are you asking me about my food now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your sleep, then. You mentioned waking up tired. How many hours of sleep do you typically get each night?
PATIENT: Hours? Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. Six, maybe? Seven? It varies. I don't really keep track. I lie down when I'm tired, and I wake up when I'm… not. Sometimes I wake up during the night, too. Just… restless. My mind wanders. I don't really have… good sleep, if that’s what you're asking. It’s never been a priority, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? What are… palpitations? Look, I'm a piano tuner, not a… a medical specimen. No, no chest pain, no. I get a bit breathless sometimes when I'm carrying a heavy piano up the stairs, but that’s just… effort. It’s normal, isn't it? I haven't collapsed or anything. Everything’s… working, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. How about your digestive system?
PATIENT: My… what now? Look, I eat food, it goes… where it needs to go. Everything functions as it should. Sometimes I get a bit of indigestion, after a heavy meal, but that’s it. Nothing… dramatic. Are you seriously asking me about my bowels, doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Let’s try this. Have there been any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father had… something with his heart, I think. He died when I was young. My mother lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I think. Bad joints. That’s about all I remember. We weren't really a close family. Didn't talk much about… ailments. It wasn't really our way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't ever had a… reaction to anything. I don't take any medications, either. Never really been one for pills. I might have taken an aspirin once, for a headache, but that’s about it. I prefer to… tough it out, if something’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological assessment. It will give me a better understanding of your overall health status. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. I have pianos to tune. But don't expect much, doctor. I'm probably perfectly healthy. Just a bit… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please lie down on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little bit high. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Your heart rate is a bit fast, and your breathing sounds a little… quiet. Your abdomen feels normal. Now, just follow my finger with your eyes. Everything seems to be functioning normally neurologically. Your reflexes are intact. Alright, that completes the basic examination. Your height is 190 centimeters, and your weight is 105 kilograms.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Am I dying or what? Honestly, all this poking and prodding… it doesn’t tell you anything, does it? I feel perfectly fine, apart from the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, the examination revealed a few things that warrant further investigation. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your heart rate is a bit fast. Your breath sounds are also diminished, which could indicate some underlying respiratory issue. These findings, combined with your reported fatigue and lack of attention to your diet and sleep, suggest that you may be experiencing some form of underlying physiological stress. It’s not necessarily life-threatening, but it’s something we need to address before it potentially develops into a more serious condition.
PATIENT: Physiological stress? Is that what you’re calling it now? Look, I tune pianos. It’s a stressful job! Bending over, reaching, making sure every note is perfect… it’s not exactly a walk in the park. It doesn't mean I'm ill, does it? Honestly, doctor, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. My wife always said I worried too much… maybe she was right.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, while I understand your skepticism, attributing your symptoms solely to the stress of your job isn't sufficient. Stress can certainly exacerbate underlying health issues, but it doesn’t explain all of your findings. To get a clearer picture of your overall health status, I recommend a few basic blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. We should also consider a chest X-ray to evaluate your lung function. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests? X-rays? Honestly, doctor, it’s getting ridiculous. Look, I came in here because my wife booked an appointment. She wanted me “optimised”. Not poked and prodded and subjected to a battery of tests. I… I suppose if it will get you off my back, I’ll do the tests. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time and money. Just remember who paid for all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. I'll have my assistant schedule the tests for you. They can be done at the lab across the street. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you try to prioritize getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night, and make some small changes to your diet, such as incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Even small improvements can make a significant difference. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Seven to eight hours… right. And more fruits and vegetables. I'll… try. Honestly, I'm not promising anything. Just… get it over with. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… when can I leave? I have a piano to tune.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. You're free to leave now. My assistant will be with you shortly to schedule the tests and provide you with the necessary paperwork. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. We're here to help. Thank you for coming in today. .
