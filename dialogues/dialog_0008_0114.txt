DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been troubling me. When I lie flat, it gets much worse. It feels like… a weight on my chest, almost. I don't know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Vanderwiele. A feeling of weight on your chest is a common way to describe breathing difficulties. So it’s worse when you lie down, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Much worse. I have to prop myself up with… well, with a lot of pillows just to get a decent breath. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month or so now? It seems to be getting a little bit worse each week, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month, progressively worsening, worse when lying flat… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My ankles do swell up a bit at the end of the day, now that you mention it. And I feel rather tired, more so than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. But I thought that was just… old age, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're telling me everything, though. Swelling in your ankles and fatigue are important things to note. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It's not always bad. But it’s definitely worse when I try to lie down, and it seems to be happening more often throughout the day, even when I’m just sitting. It just… takes more effort, you know? To get a good breath.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any coughing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just this… difficulty breathing. No cough, no wheezing, nothing like that. It’s just… hard to breathe. And it feels… tight. Is that helpful? I hope I’m explaining it alright.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Ms. Vanderwiele. "Tightness" is good information. Now, have you noticed any pain with breathing?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… uncomfortable. And scared, if I'm being honest. I don't like feeling like I can't get enough air. It’s just a tightness, and a feeling of… heaviness, like a weight. It's not a sharp pain, or anything like that. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. No pain, just tightness and heaviness. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed with that… oh, goodness, maybe ten years ago? I take medication for it, religiously. As for heart problems or diabetes, no, not that I know of. The doctor always checks, and he's never said anything. I have Medicare, so I see them quite often.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication. That’s good. Do you know what medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Ah, here it is. Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. Twenty milligrams, once a day. And I take it every morning, right after breakfast. I'm very careful about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than routine things?
PATIENT: Let me see... Oh! I had my gallbladder out, maybe twenty years ago? That was…uneventful, thankfully. And I was in the hospital for a few days with pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, no, not really. Just the usual doctor’s visits and things like that. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and pneumonia in the past. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother had… well, she had heart trouble. She ended up needing a pacemaker, years ago. And my brother had high blood pressure too, like me. Other than that… not that I recall. We weren’t a very close family, if I’m being honest. I don't know a lot about their medical histories.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart trouble and hypertension. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had any trouble. Do you think we’re almost finished? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just a couple more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I always thought it was a foolish habit. My mother smoked, and she always regretted it. I never wanted to start. Do you need to know anything else? I'd really like to get this sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. And finally, how much alcohol do you drink?
PATIENT: Just a small glass of wine with dinner, maybe three or four times a week. Nothing more, Doctor. It helps me relax. Is that alright? I do apologize for taking so much of your time. I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon, and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Okay, small amount of alcohol. Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele, that’s very helpful. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your ankles. This will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just please be quick, if you don't mind. I really need to get going shortly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a few deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. I hear some congestion in your lungs, which could be contributing to the shortness of breath. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit fast. Now, let’s take a look at your ankles. Yes, there's some swelling and pitting edema here. Now, this, combined with your symptoms and history, suggests that you may be experiencing heart failure. It’s important to remember that this is just a preliminary assessment, and we’ll need to do some further testing to confirm. I would like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and also a blood test to check your kidney function and your levels of a something called BNP, which can help us confirm if it's heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Heart…failure? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is it bad? And what does all that testing involve? Chest X-ray, EKG… it sounds frightening. I just want to be able to breathe comfortably again, Doctor. I don't want anything too complicated. Are you sure it's heart failure? I mean, could it be something else?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Vanderwiele. It is concerning to hear that term, and I apologize if I alarmed you. It's important to gather more information before we reach a definitive diagnosis. It could be something else, and that's why these tests are so important. A chest X-ray is a simple imaging test that can show us if there's any fluid in your lungs. An EKG measures the electrical activity of your heart and can tell us if there are any irregular heartbeats. The blood test will give us a better picture of your kidney function and levels of BNP, which is a hormone released when the heart is under stress. These tests are all relatively quick and painless. For now, I want to start you on a diuretic, a water pill, to help reduce some of the fluid buildup. We'll also monitor your weight closely. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A water pill… well, it sounds better than…the other thing. Monitoring my weight… I suppose I can do that. It’s just… I’m getting rather old, Doctor, and I don’t want to go through a lot of complicated procedures. But if you think it’s necessary… Yes, alright. Do what you think is best. But please explain everything clearly, before you do anything. And how long will these tests take? I have bridge club this afternoon, you see. Perhaps I can still make it?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we'll take things one step at a time. The chest X-ray and EKG should only take about 15-20 minutes each, and the blood test will be quick as well. We can get those done right here in the clinic, and the results should be back relatively quickly. Whether you can make your bridge club meeting will depend on how long it takes for the results to come back. I will do my best to expedite things. I’ll write you a prescription for Furosemide, 20mg, to be taken once a day in the morning. It's important to monitor your fluid intake and watch for any side effects, like dizziness or weakness. The nurse will go over those with you before you leave. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan if necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Furosemide… Yes. And the nurse will explain the side effects. Alright. That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so carefully. And if I start feeling dizzy or weak, I should call, right? I suppose there's nothing else for me to do now but have these tests. I just hope they don’t find anything too serious. Bridge club is very important to me, you see. It's my social life. Let’s get this over with, then.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll do everything we can to get you feeling better. Yes, if you experience any dizziness or weakness, please call the office immediately. And don't worry about bridge club for now, let's focus on getting you a clear diagnosis and starting the right treatment. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and schedule your X-ray and EKG. She’ll also go over the medication instructions with you in detail. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Cumper. You've been very kind. Please… just do what you need to do to make me feel better. I do hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: We'll do everything we can, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'll leave you with the nurse now. She'll be in shortly.
