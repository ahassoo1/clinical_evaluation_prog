DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my pee. It’s orange. I noticed it yesterday. It scared me a little.
DOCTOR: Orange urine, alright. That’s certainly something you should get checked out. It’s good you came in. Hmm… Now, have you noticed anything else along with the color change?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the color. I feel okay, I think. Maybe a little tired, but I work long hours. Does that make sense? I do… things with machines all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Long hours can definitely contribute to fatigue. "Things with machines"... okay. And just to be clear, is this a consistent orange color, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s been orange every time I go to the bathroom since yesterday morning. Not just one time. Every time. I drink a lot of water, usually. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent orange urine since yesterday morning, despite good hydration… that's helpful. Now, let's go through a few things to get a better picture. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. It feels… normal, when I go. Just orange. It’s a weird color, you know? Not like red or anything, but… orange. Like juice, almost. Does that sound strange?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound strange at all, Criston. Describing colors can be tricky. "Like juice" is a perfectly good description. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in how you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Changes… like how much? I think… maybe a little less than usual? But I’ve been drinking more water, so maybe I just feel like I’m going less. It’s hard to say, really. I don’t… pay much attention, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Many people don't actively monitor those things. So, possibly a slight decrease in volume, but hard to say for sure. Let’s talk about other things. Do you have any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No pain in my back, no. And no pain in my sides either. I lift heavy things at work sometimes, but my back is okay. It gets a little sore, but not painful. Is it bad if my pee is orange? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking. Orange urine can be caused by a lot of things, some harmless, some that need attention. It's why we’re going through these questions. No immediate cause for panic, but we need to investigate. Now, are you taking any vitamins or medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin sometimes. Not every day, just when I remember. And sometimes I take something for my… you know, for when my muscles hurt from work. It’s blue, I think. Small pills. I don't know the name, sorry. My wife buys it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally, and a blue pill for muscle soreness… That’s helpful. Do you recall how often you take the blue pill, even roughly?
PATIENT: Not very often. Maybe two or three times a week when my back is really bad. Sometimes less. I don't take it when I don’t need it. It helps, but I don’t want to take too much. Should I stop taking it? Maybe that's what's making my pee orange?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible. Some vitamins and medications can change urine color. To be safe, it would be best to temporarily stop taking the blue pill, if you’re comfortable with that. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. A physical exam is fine. I don’t mind. So, stopping the blue pill… okay. I’ll tell my wife. She’ll know what to do. Should I bring the bottle with me next time? Maybe you can see what it is?
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Criston. Yes, please bring the bottle with you if possible. Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we’ll listen to your abdomen and back, and I’ll quickly check your reflexes. It won’t take long. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is a little elevated but not concerning right now. Pulse is 72, nice and steady. Now, if you'll lie down on the exam table, I’ll listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay, 130 over… I don’t really understand those numbers. But okay, steady is good. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual noises. Now, I’m going to listen to your back. Please just breathe normally. Okay, lungs sound clear. No unusual sounds there either. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. Reflexes are normal on both sides. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Just to be thorough, I’d like to order a urinalysis. It’s a simple urine test that can help us determine if there’s anything unusual present. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, a urine test is fine. Normal reflexes… good. I’m glad everything sounds normal. I was really worried. So, just pee in a cup? I can do that. When do I need to do it?
DOCTOR: Yes, just pee in a cup. You’ll find a clean collection cup and instructions in the restroom down the hall. It’s best to do it first thing in the morning, if possible, to get the most accurate results. Please bring it back to me as soon as you can, and we’ll send it off to the lab. While we wait for the results, stopping the blue pill is a good first step. And I’ll document a possible medication side-effect as a possible cause. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Stop the blue pill, pee in a cup in the morning… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You made me feel a lot better. I was really scared about my orange pee.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Orange urine can be alarming, but it’s often something relatively minor. We’ll get the lab results back quickly, and if anything unusual shows up, we’ll discuss the next steps. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. Here's a printed sheet with instructions for the urine sample and my contact information. Take care, and please let me know how it goes. .
