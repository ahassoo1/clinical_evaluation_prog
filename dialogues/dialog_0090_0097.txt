DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband, Jean-Pierre, suggested I come. He’s been reading about these… forms. Advance directives, I believe he called them? Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… something happen. Honestly, I find it a bit morbid to plan for such things, but he’s quite insistent. I suppose it’s better to be prepared, though I don't quite understand why it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Right. Advance directives. Yes, a… prudent measure, I suppose, though often people put it off. It’s not about wanting something to happen, Ms. Chilla, it's about ensuring you decide what happens, if you are unable to speak for yourself. It’s… a bit of paperwork, really. But before we get to that, is there anything currently bothering you?
PATIENT: Currently? No, Doctor. Nothing that requires… attention, as such. I am perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I maintain a very strict diet and exercise regimen. It's this… foresight business that brought me here, not any ailment. I simply wish to get this over with and return to my schedule. It’s a rather busy time for me with the new semester approaching, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. A busy schedule is understandable. Still, even healthy individuals benefit from a little preventative planning. It's… good to be thorough. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history then, just to have it on file. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant? No, absolutely not. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, rubella – but nothing… serious. A touch of anemia in my early twenties, but that was easily rectified with a change in diet. I assure you, Doctor, I am not a frequent visitor to medical establishments. Quite the opposite, actually. I pride myself on my robust health. I’ve always been very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I have… always avoided them. Too risky, don’t you think? All those… chemicals and incisions. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. And a healthy lifestyle, of course. Really, I can't imagine anything necessitating surgery. It sounds… barbaric. Though my mother had her gallbladder removed, many years ago. But that's her, not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother lived to be eighty-seven, which is quite respectable, I think. She suffered from arthritis in her later years, and… a touch of high blood pressure. My father died quite young, from a heart attack, sadly. He… did not share my commitment to a healthy lifestyle. Smoked, drank… quite a lot. A very different person, entirely. And my brother… he’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Works in finance, terribly stressful job. But still, healthy. I believe my genes are quite strong, despite my father’s… indiscretions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, I find the very concept rather… vulgar. I eat a very balanced diet, comprised of fresh, natural ingredients. I don't consume processed foods or… artificial substances. So, no. No allergies. I may have had a slight reaction to a perfume once, years ago, but that was hardly an allergy. It simply didn’t agree with my… sensibilities. I prefer essential oils, naturally. Much more refined.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I wouldn’t dream of it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. A little rest, a proper diet, and plenty of fresh air are far more effective than any… chemical concoction. I might take a chamomile tea before bed, if I’m feeling particularly… stressed, but that’s hardly a medication. And certainly nothing prescribed by a doctor. I find the side effects… appalling.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. So, you’re feeling perfectly healthy and have no current complaints. And you're here solely to complete these advance directives. Is that a correct summary?
PATIENT: Precisely, Doctor. You summarize admirably. My husband, bless his heart, is simply being… overly cautious. But I suppose it’s better to indulge him than to endure his constant fretting. Though, frankly, I find the entire process rather… morbid. Still, let us get this over with, shall we? What precisely is involved? And how long will it take? I have a faculty meeting at four o’clock.
DOCTOR: Very well. It involves completing a few forms outlining your wishes regarding medical treatment should you become unable to communicate them yourself. It's essentially two parts: a living will, which specifies the types of treatments you want or don't want, and a durable power of attorney for healthcare, which names someone to make decisions on your behalf. It will take approximately thirty to forty-five minutes. Before we begin, though, I’d like to quickly check your vitals, just for documentation. Blood pressure, pulse, perhaps listen to your heart and lungs. A standard procedure, even for healthy individuals. It's just… good practice.
PATIENT: Vitals? Doctor, with all due respect, I find that rather unnecessary. I assure you, my health is perfectly sound. I’ve already stated that repeatedly. I understand you have procedures to follow, but… honestly, it feels rather demeaning. I've never had my vitals checked in my life, and I see no reason to start now. Surely, my word is sufficient? I am a highly educated woman, perfectly capable of articulating my wishes. I believe my husband would agree.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, it’s not a matter of whether I believe you. It's a matter of completing a thorough medical record. It’s standard procedure, and frankly, it’s somewhat… irresponsible not to. It provides a baseline for comparison, should anything ever change. It doesn't invalidate your wishes; it simply documents your current state of health. It takes less than five minutes. It’s not about doubting you; it's about providing the best possible care. I understand your reluctance, but I must insist. It's part of my professional obligation. If you refuse a basic physical assessment, I will be unable to complete the advance directives. It’s as simple as that.
PATIENT: Are you… are you refusing to help me? Because my husband suggested I come here? This is… outrageous! I came to you for a service, a simple formality, and you are now… imposing conditions? I fail to see how a brief examination is relevant to outlining my preferences regarding end-of-life care. It’s preposterous! I think I’ve wasted enough of my valuable time. I shall find another physician, one who respects my autonomy and doesn’t resort to… petty bureaucracy. This is simply unacceptable. You clearly misunderstand my… sensibilities.
