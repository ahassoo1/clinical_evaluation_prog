DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Mirriam. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, a couple of days now. Really quite persistent, they are. Not painful, just… annoying!
DOCTOR: Yes, hiccups can certainly be bothersome, even if they aren't painful. A couple of days is a bit longer than usual for hiccups to persist. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… regular, I suppose? Not like a big, booming one, more of a little hic every now and then. It feels like… something just twitches inside, right under my ribs. Sometimes they come when I'm eating, sometimes just… out of nowhere. I haven’t been able to find anything that makes them stop, though. Tried holding my breath, like everyone says, but no luck!
DOCTOR: Alright, regular, smaller hiccups, with a twitching sensation under the ribs. They occur both during eating and spontaneously, and holding your breath hasn’t helped. That’s helpful information, Mirriam. Do you recall anything specific that you were doing or eating when they first started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, that was a couple of days ago… I was having lunch with Elsie, down at the community hall. We had… fish, I think. Fried fish, and some taro. Elsie made a lovely coconut sauce for it. Oh! And a glass of guava juice. I do love guava juice. Could be that? It’s just… I have guava juice fairly often and haven’t had this trouble before. It’s a bit of a mystery, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is a bit of a mystery, yes. And it’s good that you mention you’ve had guava juice before without issue. Sometimes it is something specific, but it can also be a number of things. Let’s go through some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the hiccups – perhaps any heartburn, indigestion, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that, Doctor. No heartburn, not really. My tummy feels alright. Maybe a little bit gassy sometimes, but I put that down to Elsie’s cooking – she does love her onions! And no trouble swallowing, thankfully. Everything goes down just fine. I eat a good lunch, you know. Gotta keep my strength up!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No heartburn, no difficulty swallowing… and normal appetite. So, no other digestive issues. Now, have you been taking any new medications recently, Mirriam?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don't take a lot of medicine. Just my blood pressure pills, which I’ve been on for years and years. And a little bit of vitamin D in the winter, the doctor recommended it, you know, for my bones. But that’s it, really. Nothing new at all. I try to stay healthy, mostly! Though these hiccups are making me feel a bit… jittery, if I’m honest. It’s the constant twitching that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just your regular blood pressure medication and occasional vitamin D. No recent changes to your medication list. Alright. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to start? Well, I had a bit of a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. Healed up just fine, thankfully, with a bit of physiotherapy. And I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, back in my thirties. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, really. Not much trouble, all in all. I always say, a good diet and plenty of sunshine does wonders! A bit of exercise too, when I can manage it. Is that helpful, Doctor? Should I tell you about Elsie's fall last month? She slipped on the wet tiles…
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mirriam. Knowing about the wrist fracture and gallbladder removal is good. And you don’t need to worry about Elsie’s fall right now, we’re focusing on you today. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, haven't had a reaction yet! Elsie is always teasing me about my adventurous palate. I can't say I'm afraid of trying new foods. My mother always said, "A little bit of everything won't hurt you!" And I haven't had any trouble with medications either, not ever. I’m pretty sure I’d remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? It's a good thing, I suppose, being able to remember these things! I can't imagine having to worry about that on top of these hiccups. It's bad enough just having them!
DOCTOR: That's excellent to know. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m always happy to be checked. Makes me feel a bit better, knowing everything's alright. Though my blood pressure is usually pretty good, I have to say. I try to watch my salt, you know. Elsie always tells me I'm too careful, but better safe than sorry! Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm a bit old-fashioned, so I'm not used to all these fancy medical machines!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mirriam. It's just a quick check. Nothing fancy at all. And I completely understand. It’s always best to be cautious. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is perfectly normal. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs sound clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just lie back comfortably and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, that sounds good. I'll just lie back here. Everything feels alright, to be honest, but you go ahead. I do trust your judgement. And please, don't hesitate to ask if I feel anything strange. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding! It’s better to be sure, like you said. Oh, Elsie always says I worry too much, but what can you do? A worrying mind is half the battle, she says. Although, right now, all I’m worrying about is these pesky hiccups!
DOCTOR: Your abdomen feels soft and there’s no tenderness. Everything feels normal. It doesn’t seem to be anything obvious causing your hiccups based on the physical exam. Now, given the duration and lack of other symptoms, it's likely these hiccups are benign, perhaps due to some mild irritation of the diaphragm. However, it's always good to rule out other possibilities, especially since they’ve been going on for a couple of days. Would you be agreeable to getting a chest X-ray just to be on the safe side?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray? I haven't had one of those in… well, I don't even remember! I suppose if you think it’s best, Doctor, I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. I wouldn’t want anything serious to be overlooked, would I? Is it… uncomfortable? Elsie had one once and said something about holding her breath? I'm not sure I'm very good at holding my breath for long, to be honest! But, if it helps, then I’ll do it. I trust your judgement. You seem very thorough, Doctor. Just let me know what I need to do. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if it's going to be unpleasant! I'm an old woman, you know. Everything feels a bit more… noticeable these days!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mirriam. An X-ray is a very quick and safe procedure. You’ll be asked to stand or lie down, and the technician will take a few images of your chest. It does involve holding your breath for a few seconds each time, but it's not a long breath-hold. And it doesn’t involve any pain or discomfort. It’s just a precautionary measure to rule out anything unusual, like irritation of the lungs or diaphragm. We can arrange for the X-ray to be done right here at the clinic. If everything looks normal on the X-ray, we can likely attribute the hiccups to a benign cause and they should resolve on their own. If they don’t, or if the X-ray shows something concerning, we can discuss further options. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Let's go ahead and schedule it. It's best to get it over with, isn't it? Less worrying that way. Though I do hope nothing's wrong! Elsie will be worried sick if she finds out I’ve had an X-ray. She always thinks the worst. Just let me know when and where I need to go. And, if it's not too much trouble, could you explain the process to me one more time? I just want to be prepared. It’s not that I’m scared, you understand. Just… old-fashioned! I'm not used to all these modern medical things. But, thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind and patient with me. It’s a relief to know I'm in good hands.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mirriam. Absolutely no problem. The X-ray will be done in the radiology department, just down the hall. A technician will position you in front of the X-ray machine and ask you to take a deep breath and hold it while they take a picture. It takes just a few seconds. They will then repeat the process from a different angle. The whole procedure should take about ten minutes, tops. You won't feel anything during the X-ray. Afterwards, the radiologist will review the images and send the results to me. I’ll review them as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss the findings at a follow-up appointment. I’m scheduling it for this afternoon at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two o'clock this afternoon is perfect, Doctor. Thank you. That gives me time to have a bit of lunch and calm my nerves. Though I’m sure it'll be alright. Elsie always says I worry too much, but it’s just my nature, I suppose. And it's good to be thorough, isn't it? Just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare. Should I wear a special gown or anything? And, if you don't mind, could you tell me what we’re looking for on the X-ray? I know I shouldn’t ask, but I always like to understand what's going on. It makes me feel less… helpless, you know? But, thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a real comfort. And, if these hiccups don’t go away, what would be the next step? Just in case. I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. No special gown is required; just wear comfortable clothes. As for what we're looking for on the X-ray, we’ll be checking for any signs of irritation in your lungs or diaphragm, or any other unusual findings that might be causing the hiccups. It’s a pretty straightforward scan, and most of the time it comes back normal. If the X-ray doesn't reveal any obvious cause and the hiccups persist, we can consider other options, such as blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In rare cases, we might refer you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. But let's not worry about that just yet. Let's focus on getting the X-ray done first and see what the results show. Do you have any questions about the X-ray process or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me, and I appreciate it. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. And, if the hiccups don't go away… well, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, as Elsie always says. Thank you again for your kindness and understanding. It's a relief to know I'm in good hands. I suppose I should head home now and have some lunch before my appointment? It always helps to have a full stomach.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mirriam. A full stomach is always a good idea! It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And I hope the hiccups resolve on their own before then. Have a lovely day, and I look forward to seeing you this afternoon.
