DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I’m Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my joints, you see. They get real stiff in the mornings. It takes a while to… to get going, you know? It’s just… achy. I don’t really know how to explain it good. It’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. A long while.
DOCTOR: “A long while…” Okay. And when you say “mornings”, how long after you wake up does the stiffness typically last?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long… hmm. Let me think. It’s… at least an hour, maybe two? Sometimes even longer if it’s cold, or… or if I’ve been sitting for a bit. I don’t really keep track, you see. I just know it’s not nice first thing. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I'm not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: Right. So, more than an hour, potentially up to two, and worse with cold or inactivity. And where exactly are you feeling this stiffness and aching?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly in my… my fingers, I think. And my knees. Sometimes my shoulders too, but mostly the fingers and knees. It's… all over, really, but those are the worst. It makes it hard to… to do things, you know? Like… opening jars, or getting up from the chair. It’s just… frustrating. I don't remember when it started being so bad, though. It just… slowly got there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any redness or swelling in those joints, specifically?
PATIENT: Redness… swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Sometimes they feel a bit bigger, maybe, but I thought that was just… me. I haven’t really looked closely, if that makes sense. I just feel the ache, you know? I’m not good at noticing things like redness. Is that important? I get a little confused with all the medical talk.
DOCTOR: It can be. Okay. Let's move on then. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like arthritis before?
PATIENT: Arthritis… oh, goodness. I don’t think so. No, I don’t think anyone ever told me I had that. My husband… he always took care of the doctor things. He passed away a few years back, and I just… haven’t really kept up with it, you know? I’m sorry, I’m rambling. I don't even remember seeing a doctor much before that. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. We can figure things out. Any family history of joint problems – your parents, siblings, anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness… family history… Let me see. My mother, she had… aches and pains, I think. Old age, mostly. She was a bit stooped over when she got older. And my brother… he worked a lot with his hands, building things. He always complained about his knuckles. But I don’t know if it was the same thing, you know? Just… aches and pains of getting old, maybe. I wasn't really paying attention back then. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken anything for this pain recently – over-the-counter things like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I have some… some aspirin, I think. But I don't really take it much. It doesn’t seem to do a lot of good. I don't like taking pills if I can help it, you know? My husband always said they weren’t good for you. I've tried some creams, the kind you rub on, but they didn't really help either. I mostly just… try to move around, you know? It hurts, but I try.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you could? It hurts a bit to move them sometimes, you know. I’m not very strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please sit up here for me. First, I’m just going to feel around your joints, see if there’s any swelling or tenderness. I’ll start with your fingers. Okay. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. And just to confirm, is this a sharp pain, or more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little tender, yes. Right there. And… it’s more of a dull ache, I think. Not a sharp pain. It’s just… uncomfortable. It’s like a… a deep ache, you know? It doesn’t come and go quickly, it’s just… always there, a little bit. It gets worse when you push on it, though. That’s for sure. Oh, and it’s a little stiff, even when you’re just touching it. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… They feel a bit…grindy, you know? Like… bones rubbing together. And they’re a little tender on the sides, here and here. . It hurts to bend them all the way, and it’s hard to get up from a chair sometimes. Not every time, but… a lot of the time. It's a dull ache too, like my fingers. It’s just… getting old, I guess. Do you think so, Doctor? I’m probably just falling apart. Sorry, I shouldn’t complain.
DOCTOR: Alright. It doesn't sound like "just falling apart". We need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood work – just a standard panel to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes. And I'd also like to get some X-rays of your hands and knees, just to see what's going on with the joints themselves. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work and X-rays… goodness. That sounds… a bit much. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Of course. Whatever you need to do. I just… I don’t like needles, you know? And I don't really understand what the X-rays will show. Will it hurt? I'm probably just worrying too much.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be worried. The blood draw is quick – just a little pinch. And the X-rays don't hurt at all – you just stand still for a moment while the machine takes a picture. It helps us see the bones and joints and get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to keep active, within your comfort level, and avoiding activities that worsen the pain. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds alright. Not too bad, then. Keeping active… I try. It’s just… hard sometimes, you know? Okay. Um… what if it's something serious? What if it’s… arthritis? I've heard that's really bad. I don't want to end up in a wheelchair. Sorry, I'm being silly. It’s just… I get worried easily.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all. It's good to be informed, and to express your concerns. If it is arthritis, there are many different types, and many different ways to manage it. Not all arthritis leads to needing a wheelchair – in fact, most people can live full and active lives with proper treatment. We'll discuss all the options once we have the results of the tests. For now, let’s just focus on getting those done. My nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-rays. I’ll give her a note with your insurance information – though you mentioned you aren't insured, we can work with the clinic’s financial assistance programs to find a way to make things affordable. Does that sound okay?
