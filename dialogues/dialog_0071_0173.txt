DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Galena, nice to meet you. Well, I’ve just been getting these chills, you know? Not like a fever chill, just…cold. It’s been happening on and off for a couple of days now.
DOCTOR: Chills, alright. On and off for a couple of days… I see. And is it just the chills, or are you experiencing anything else alongside them?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I guess. And maybe a tiny bit achy, but honestly, I always feel a little achy. It's hard to say if that’s new. Definitely not a cough or anything, though. No sore throat either. Just…cold and tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold and tired… no cough, no sore throat. That’s helpful. When you say tired, is it like needing an extra hour of sleep, or more debilitating than that?
PATIENT: It’s not like I can’t function, if that makes sense. I still went to work, still did everything. But by the end of the day, I just…plop. Usually I have a little energy left, but these past couple of days I’ve been completely wiped. Does that make sense? I don't know what's normal anymore, honestly. Being divorced and working…it's a lot!
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jailenne. Life throws a lot at us, and it's easy to lose track of what is normal when things are busy. So, you're experiencing fatigue that's a bit more pronounced than usual, alongside these on-and-off chills. Let's see…have you been running a temperature, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No, I haven't checked my temperature. I don’t really have a thermometer at home, actually. I figured if I had a fever, I’d feel it, you know? But it doesn't feel like a fever, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s fair. Sometimes you can tell, sometimes you can’t. Okay. And have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! My appetite hasn’t been great. Not that I’m not eating, but I haven’t been really hungry. I usually love breakfast, but I just haven't been feeling it.
DOCTOR: Reduced appetite… alright. Any nausea or vomiting with that?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Just…not interested in food, you know? Like, I can eat if I make myself, but it doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you travelled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: No, I haven't travelled anywhere. Just work and home, really. And…hmm. Old Mrs. Henderson, who I help out with sometimes, had a bad cold last week. But I mostly just drop off her groceries, we don’t really sit and chat. So I don’t think I was really close to her while she was sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited exposure. Good to know. Now, just to get a better picture, do you have any underlying medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat well when I can, and I walk whenever I get the chance. Just…stress, I guess. I had a check-up last year and everything was fine, though. I have private insurance, so I get everything checked regularly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications or have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, thankfully. And no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your throat, and feel your lymph nodes. It’s pretty standard procedure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Galena. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up there for me, that’d be great. Heart sounds are regular. A little quick, but not alarming. Lungs are clear…no wheezing or crackling. Throat looks normal, no significant redness or swelling. Lymph nodes are…slightly tender on the sides of your neck, but not significantly enlarged. Alright. So, everything seems relatively normal on the physical exam, but the slight tenderness in your lymph nodes and the fatigue are a bit concerning. It could be a mild viral infection, or… we should probably rule out a few other possibilities. Have you had a blood test recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any blood work done recently. Like I said, I had a check-up last year, but nothing since then. What possibilities are you thinking about? I don’t want to worry needlessly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s best to be thorough. Fatigue and chills can have many causes, from something as simple as a cold to… less common things like mononucleosis or even early signs of thyroid issues. It's unlikely, but it's good to rule them out. Now, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid panel just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, then yes, let’s do the blood work. Where do I go to get that done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here’s a requisition for the lab work. You can go to [Name of local lab] – it’s just down the street at [Address of lab]. They’re open until 5 PM today. It should just be a quick blood draw. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. Now, in the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and trying to eat something nutritious, even if you don’t feel very hungry. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Rest, fluids, food…I can do that. Thank you, Dr. Galena. I appreciate you being thorough. I’ll head to the lab this afternoon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. It’s my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before we get the results. Get some rest, and I’ll talk to you soon.
