DOCTOR: Hello, Gabbrielle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's August 2nd, and I see you’re 31 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It’s about this…patch on my skin. It’s rather unsightly, if I’m being honest. I noticed it a few weeks ago and it hasn’t gone away. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a skin patch that’s been present for a few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s just… not attractive. It’s on my forearm, right here. It’s… a sort of brownish color, I suppose. Not a nice brown, more of a…muddy brown. And it’s flat. Not raised or anything, thankfully. I’d hate for it to be bumpy. It’s not itchy or painful, just…visible. I really don't understand what could cause something like that. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, and I certainly don't spend much time in the sun.
DOCTOR: Alright, a flat, muddy brown patch on your inner forearm that isn’t itchy or painful, and you haven’t noticed any changes in your routine or sun exposure. That’s helpful. When you say a few weeks, can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started sometime after my cousin’s wedding. That was… July 12th, I believe. So, roughly three weeks, maybe a little longer. It was very subtle at first, I almost didn’t notice it. I just assumed it was a shadow or something. Then I realized it wasn’t moving with the light, and that’s when I started paying attention. It really hasn’t changed much since then, thankfully. Just…exists. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began around July 12th and hasn’t changed significantly since then. Do you recall anything specific happening around that time that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Relevant? I doubt it. My cousin's wedding was perfectly normal. A lot of family, a lot of pierogies... I helped my aunt with the flower arrangements, but I was wearing gloves the whole time. I didn’t go near any unusual plants or anything. Honestly, I find it hard to believe something from the wedding caused it. Everything was very… domestic. Unless… did you mean anything I did specifically? I did try a new hand lotion, now that you mention it. A lavender scent. From that organic shop downtown. But that was a week after the wedding.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a new lavender hand lotion about a week after the wedding. That’s good to know. Have you used any other new products recently – soaps, detergents, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’m quite particular about my products, you see. I’ve used the same soap for years—a simple, unscented olive oil bar. And my detergent is hypoallergenic. I wouldn’t risk irritating my skin with anything new. Really, I’m very careful. It’s just… baffling, this patch. It’s as if it materialized out of thin air. Perhaps it’s simply a fluke. A temporary discoloration. Though, three weeks is a rather long “temporary,” isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You're right, three weeks is a bit long for a temporary discoloration. Let's take a closer look at the patch itself. Would you mind rolling up your sleeve so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Certainly. There. Be careful, please. I don't want it disturbed. And do tell me if you see anything… concerning. I'd rather know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It's approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter, flat, with somewhat irregular borders. The color is a brownish hue, as you described, and it feels smooth to the touch. There’s no tenderness on palpation, and no noticeable warmth or swelling. I don’t see any scaling or crusting. It appears well-defined, but it's hard to say definitively without closer inspection. I'm going to document these findings. Do you have any other skin changes anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I keep myself well-maintained, you see. I haven’t noticed anything else. No new moles, no rashes, no unusual dryness… nothing. I assure you, this is a solitary incident. It’s quite strange, really. I’ve never had anything like this before. Though, my grandmother used to get these… age spots, I believe. But she was quite elderly. And this isn't raised, like hers were. This is just… flat. And an unpleasant color. It’s simply ruining my summer wardrobe, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other skin changes and you've mentioned your grandmother had age spots, but this is different in that it's flat. Have you had a recent illness, even a mild cold or flu?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I pride myself on a robust immune system. I haven't been sick in… well, I can't even remember. I take my vitamins, I eat a healthy diet… I simply don’t get sick. I've been perfectly well. Perhaps it's the stress from my husband's work. He's been dealing with a very difficult client. Though, I hardly think stress manifests as a brownish patch on my forearm. It's much more likely to cause a headache, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: You’re right, stress more often manifests as headaches. Okay, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. My doctor always tells me my blood pressure is excellent, and my cholesterol is perfectly normal. I had my thyroid checked a few years ago—everything was fine. Honestly, I'm a picture of health. That’s what makes this patch so… perplexing. It simply doesn’t fit with my overall medical profile. I almost feel as if it’s a misdiagnosis. Perhaps you should double-check?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. We’ve covered a lot, and you are indeed very healthy. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any skin cancers or had any family history of skin cancers?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My family is…rather robust, health-wise. No history of cancer at all, as far as I'm aware. My great-aunt Mildred had a rather nasty fall, broke her hip, but that’s the closest we’ve come to anything serious. Skin cancer… no, absolutely not. Honestly, I’m quite meticulous about sun protection. I use a high SPF whenever I’m outside, and I avoid peak sun hours. This patch… it’s just an anomaly. A frustrating, unsightly anomaly, but an anomaly nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of skin cancers. And you're diligent about sun protection. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my daily multivitamin. A simple one, from the pharmacy. And occasionally, I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's very infrequent. I prefer to manage my headaches with rest and a cup of chamomile tea, if possible. I try to avoid taking unnecessary medications. I believe in a holistic approach to health. Honestly, this patch is making me question everything. Perhaps it’s simply a result of stress, despite my best efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and infrequent ibuprofen. Given your history and the appearance of the patch, my initial thought is this could be a post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Sometimes, even a minor skin irritation, something you might not even remember, can cause a dark spot like this. However, to be certain, it’s best to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to perform a simple skin biopsy. It’s a quick, relatively painless procedure where we take a small sample of the skin and send it to the lab for analysis. It will give us a definitive answer. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Really? That sounds… rather drastic, doesn’t it? For a small patch? I mean, I understand you want to be thorough, but… cutting into my skin? I hadn't anticipated this. And what if it's painful? Will it leave a scar? Honestly, I’m rather hesitant. Isn’t there… anything else we can try? Perhaps a stronger cream? Or a different lotion? I’d really prefer to avoid a biopsy if possible. I have a rather important social engagement next month, and I certainly don’t want a bandage on my forearm.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Gabbrielle. A biopsy does sound more invasive, and I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was the most prudent course of action given your history and the patch’s appearance. The good news is, it’s a very minor procedure. We use a local anesthetic, so you won’t feel any pain. It’s a tiny sample – about the size of a pencil eraser. And yes, there will be a small scar, but it’s usually very faint and easily concealable with makeup. However, I respect your concerns. We could try a topical lightening cream with hydroquinone for a few weeks and see if that improves the discoloration. But it's important to understand that it may not be effective, and it won’t give us a definitive diagnosis. If the patch is something more serious, we could be delaying treatment. It’s a bit of a trade-off. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A cream… that sounds much more appealing, honestly. Delaying treatment… no, I certainly don’t want that. But the idea of a biopsy still makes me uneasy. And a scar… simply dreadful. Perhaps we could try the cream for a short period - say, four weeks? And if it doesn't show any significant improvement, then we can discuss the biopsy again. But I’d really prefer to exhaust all other options first. It’s just… the thought of a scalpel near my skin… it’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Gabbrielle. We can certainly try a topical lightening cream with hydroquinone for four weeks. I’ll write you a prescription for a 4% cream, which is a standard strength. Apply a thin layer to the patch twice daily, and be sure to protect the area from the sun with a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher. If you don't see any noticeable improvement after four weeks, we can re-evaluate and discuss the possibility of a biopsy again. In the meantime, if the patch changes in any way—becomes larger, more painful, itchy, or bleeds—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about the cream or anything we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Four weeks, twice daily, sunscreen… I can manage that. And contact you if it changes. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I really do hope this cream works. I'm quite tired of worrying about it, honestly. Thank you again. I'll be in touch if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gabbrielle. I understand your concerns, and I’m hopeful the cream will be effective. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to check on your progress. Have a good day, and enjoy your upcoming social engagement. .
