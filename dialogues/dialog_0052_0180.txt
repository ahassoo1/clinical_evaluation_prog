DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, okay? It's this… tiredness. Just so tired. And… well, it's embarrassing, but I been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to worry me, I guess. My daughter keeps fussing. It’s just… I crave it. Like something’s missing. I don’t know why I’m telling you this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I assure you, you're in a safe space here. The tiredness and the craving for dirt – those are both important pieces of information. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? I’m tired. All the time. Doesn’t matter how much I sleep. Or what I eat. It's just… dragging. Makes it hard to even think sometimes, let alone get anything done at work. I program those… CNC machines, you know? Needs focus. Can't focus when you're this wiped out. It's been getting worse for… a while now. Months, at least. Maybe longer. Honestly, I lose track.
DOCTOR: Okay, months of increasing fatigue, even with adequate sleep and nutrition, and impacting your ability to concentrate at work. That's very helpful. You mentioned CNC machine programming – that does require significant focus, so it’s understandable that this is concerning. When you say "tired," can you describe it a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Ugh. Fine. It's not just… sleepy. It's like… everything is heavy. My arms, my legs, my brain. Like I’m wading through mud. And it doesn’t go away with rest. Coffee doesn't even help anymore, and I used to be able to drink a whole pot and still get things done. It’s just… a constant weight. And the dirt… I just feel better after I eat some. Don't look at me like that. I know it sounds crazy.
DOCTOR: I’m not looking at you in any particular way, Ms. Cantoran. As a physician, I’ve heard many things, and my role is to understand what’s happening with you, without judgment. The sensation of heaviness, not relieved by rest, and the temporary relief you experience after consuming dirt… that's very important information. Could you tell me a little about how much dirt you’ve been eating, and for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. How much? It's not like I'm shoveling it in! Just… a little. A handful, maybe, a couple times a week. Started… I don't know, maybe three months ago? Four? It’s hard to say. It's just… the craving comes and goes. And when it hits, a little dirt just...calms it. It's not like I want to eat dirt, it’s just… a need. Like something’s missing. And yes, I know it’s weird. My daughter is constantly telling me I'm going to get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, a handful a couple times a week for approximately three to four months, with the sensation of a craving. And you feel a temporary relief after consuming it. It’s helpful you’re able to articulate this, Ms. Cantoran. It’s not uncommon for unusual cravings to be associated with underlying deficiencies. To get a better understanding of what might be causing this, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and craving?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Well, my stomach’s been a little… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… queasy sometimes. And I've been more irritable, I guess. Snapping at my daughter more than usual. She says I'm being difficult. Probably because I'm tired and eating dirt, if you want to know the truth. Oh, and my hands… they ache sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to notice. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts. Queasiness, increased irritability, and hand aches are all important pieces of the puzzle. When you say “hand aches,” can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s not like a sharp pain. More like a dull ache. Deep inside my hands. And sometimes my fingers get… tingly. Not numb, exactly. Just… a weird feeling. It's worse when I'm working on the machines, using my hands a lot. It's probably just arthritis, if you want to know the truth. My mother had it bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache and tingling in your hands, particularly when using them at work. It's understandable you're considering arthritis given your mother's history. To help me determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Not really. Just… the usual. Had the flu a few times, a bad cold last winter. Oh, and I broke my arm when I was a kid. Doesn't seem relevant, does it? I don't take any regular medications, if that's what you're asking. And… I haven't been to a doctor in years. Honestly, what's the point? They just tell you to rest and drink more water.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited medical history, no regular medications, and infrequent doctor visits. I understand your skepticism, Ms. Cantoran. My goal is to listen to your concerns and work with you to find answers. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I don't like hospitals. Bad smells, too many people poking at you. Just… no. Never been in a hospital for anything except when I broke my arm as a kid, and that was a long time ago. I’d rather just deal with things myself, if you want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. I understand and respect your preferences, Ms. Cantoran. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh, more questions. My mother… she had the arthritis, like I said. And her mother, too. On my father's side… I don’t really know. He wasn't around much when I was growing up. He was… a complicated man. And I don’t know anything about his family. Honestly, it's not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis on your mother’s side, and limited information about your father’s family. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Are we really doing this? Look, I’m a perfectly normal person. I don’t smoke, I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, and I certainly don’t do drugs. What kind of person do you think I am? I work hard, I take care of my daughter, and I just want to feel better. This whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Cantoran. I understand your frustration. I assure you, I’m not making any judgments. These questions are simply part of a comprehensive assessment to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Now, could you tell me a bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. I eat… normal food. I try to. I cook for my daughter, mostly. We eat a lot of chicken, rice, beans. Sometimes pasta. I don’t really have time to make fancy meals. And like I said, I’ve been craving dirt, which isn’t exactly healthy, I know. But it’s just… a need. A weird, awful need. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, a typical diet of chicken, rice, beans, and pasta. And the ongoing craving for dirt. Now, just one more question about your lifestyle. Are you experiencing any significant stress in your life right now?
PATIENT: Stress? Is that a joke? Of course I'm stressed! I'm tired all the time, I'm eating dirt, my daughter keeps fussing, and I’m running on empty trying to keep my job. What part of my life isn’t stressful? Honestly, I don’t know how much more I can take.
DOCTOR: Okay, significant stress related to fatigue, the unusual cravings, your daughter's concerns, and work. Now, Ms. Cantoran, given everything you’ve told me – the fatigue, the craving for dirt , the irritability, the hand aches, the queasiness, and the stress – I'd like to conduct a physical exam and order some lab work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking and prodding? Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I have things to do. But honestly, I bet it’s just stress. And maybe I need a vacation. But I can't afford one.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. I agree, stress can certainly play a role, and we'll explore that. But it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes as well. First, I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, examine your abdomen, and check your neurological function. Finally, I’ll take a look at your hands to assess the aches and tingling. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But don't tell me I need to "relax" or "take more vitamins". I'm already doing the best I can. And please, be gentle with my hands. They hurt enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible, and I assure you, I won't suggest anything unrealistic. Your blood pressure is 135/85, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 78 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Her heart sounds are regular, but I do detect some mild wheezing in her lower lungs. Now, I’ll listen to your abdomen. Her abdomen is soft, but she does report some mild tenderness in the upper quadrants.
PATIENT: Tenderness? Probably just indigestion. I ate a bad burrito last week, if you want to know the truth. But go ahead, poke around. It doesn’t really matter anyway. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Now, I’m going to examine your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me?
PATIENT: There. See? Hurts right here. And when I squeeze things, sometimes my fingers tingle. It’s just… annoying. It makes it hard to do my job.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some tenderness and slight swelling at the base of both thumbs. This could be indicative of De Quervain’s tenosynovitis, which is an inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. However, we need to rule out other possibilities with some lab work. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function – your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Her reflexes are normal, and her strength and sensation are intact. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the physical exam, I'd like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. I also recommend a ferritin level to rule out iron deficiency. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more blood? Seriously? Fine. Whatever. Just… please tell me I don't have anything serious. And don't give me a lecture about eating better. I'm already stressed enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Cantoran. We're just gathering information at this point. These tests will help us determine if there's an underlying cause for your symptoms. I absolutely won’t lecture you. The blood work will take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and getting as much rest as possible. I’m also going to give you a referral to a therapist who specializes in stress management. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Therapy? Ugh, no. I don't need a stranger telling me my problems. I can handle things myself. Just… give me the results when they're ready. And please, don't keep me waiting. I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. I won’t push the therapy referral. I will contact you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss them. I anticipate the results will be back within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. I need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you a good day, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you need anything. .
