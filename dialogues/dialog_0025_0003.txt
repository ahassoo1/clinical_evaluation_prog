DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Just this…shaking. It’s a nuisance, really. Been happening for a while now, and it’s not getting any better. My wife used to say… well, never mind what she said. It's just… annoying. Can we just get this sorted, please? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Shaking,” you say. And for how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while. Months, I guess? Maybe longer. I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s bad, sometimes it’s barely noticeable. It's hard to say exactly when it started. Why does it matter so much? It just is.
DOCTOR: It matters because understanding when it started, and how it's changed, helps me figure out why it's happening, Mr. Baide. It’s not about being difficult, it’s about finding the cause. Now, is the shaking worse with movement?
PATIENT: Movement? Hmm… I suppose so. When I try to, uh… what was I saying? Oh, right. When I try to do things. Like, holding a cup of coffee gets tricky, you know? Spillin' it all over myself. And buttonin’ my shirt... forget about it! My caregiver has to do that now. It’s embarrassing, frankly. But I don’t see what you can do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s worse when you're actively doing things, particularly with your hands. And it's gotten to the point where you need assistance with daily tasks. Have you noticed it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Elsewhere? Like... my feet? I dunno. I haven't really paid that much attention. I mostly notice it when I’m trying to do something, like I said. Honestly, this whole thing is just getting old. It’s probably just old age, isn’t it? Everyone gets shaky when they get to my age. Let’s just skip to the part where you tell me there’s nothing to be done about it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, dismissing something as "just old age" isn’t good medical practice. While aging can contribute to some changes, we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Oh, lord. What am I, a walking medical textbook? I get tired, of course. I’m eighty years old! My memory isn't what it used to be… though that’s probably obvious. And sometimes my… my hands feel a little stiff. But everyone gets stiff joints when they’re old! Is this really necessary? I just want something to make it stop shaking, not a whole life story requested.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, memory issues, and stiffness in your hands. Do these symptoms come and go, or are they constant?
PATIENT: Ugh, constant, I guess. Or… mostly constant. Some days are better than others, but it’s always there. Look, I don't want to make a big deal out of everything. It's just…annoying. Can we just get a pill or something and be done with this? My daughter always wants me to go to the doctor for everything... she worries too much. Honestly, I’m fine. Mostly. Just…shaky.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand you're frustrated, but simply handing out a “pill” without understanding the cause could be… irresponsible. We need to explore what's going on. Have you experienced any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Now you're askin' about my eyes? I wear glasses, of course. Have for years. No, no changes. They’re… blurry, like they always are. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a lunch appointment. A simple lunch. Hard to eat with these hands…you wouldn't believe. I really think this is just part of getting old. I’m tired of talkin' about it. Can we just…wrap it up? .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a brief neurological exam. It will involve checking your reflexes, coordination, and balance. And I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a precaution. Please follow my instructions as best you can. It's important. Would that be alright?
