DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I am Dr. Blim. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. I need a letter saying I'm able to fly. It's for a… well, a trip I’m planning. It's a bit complicated, but the airline needs official confirmation from a doctor.
DOCTOR: A letter for airline travel. Hmm. While I appreciate directness, Ms. Sayar, simply being able to fly isn’t sufficient medical clearance. There are numerous conditions, even seemingly minor ones, that could be contraindications. I require a detailed explanation of why you need this letter. Are you currently under treatment for any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand. Sorry, I didn’t mean to be… vague. It’s just… personal. I lost my husband last year, unexpectedly, and I’m going back to Mongolia to… spread his ashes. It’s a long flight, and they're being very strict about health confirmations since… well, everything that happened with the pandemic. I was briefly seeing a therapist for grief counseling, but that finished a few months ago. Otherwise, no, I’m not currently under treatment for anything. I'm generally healthy. Really.
DOCTOR: I see. A difficult situation, certainly. However, "generally healthy" is insufficient for a medical clearance for air travel, especially a long-haul flight. Grief, while profoundly impactful, isn't a medical condition that requires clearance. We need to assess for any underlying issues that may have arisen as a result of your loss. Have you experienced any changes in your physical health since your husband's passing?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I haven't been sleeping perfectly, but who does, after something like that? But no new conditions, no chest pain, nothing like that. I’ve actually been trying to take better care of myself, you know? More walking, eating a bit better. Just trying to… keep going. Honestly, Doctor, I think they’re just being extra cautious. It’s a small airline, and it’s a long way to go.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I understand your frustration, but my responsibility is to ensure your safety, not to simply provide a letter to satisfy an airline's regulations. "Trying to take better care of yourself" is admirable, but it doesn't preclude the possibility of an underlying condition. Let's proceed systematically. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or fainting spells in the past six months?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. Honestly, Doctor, I really haven’t. I’ve had a little bit of anxiety, which makes my heart race sometimes, but that's it. It’s always when I’m thinking about the trip, or remembering things… not a physical problem, just… stress. I can take a deep breath and it goes away. I really think this is unnecessary, but I’m happy to answer your questions. It’s just… the sooner I get the letter, the sooner I can get this trip over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us review your medical history, then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – hypertension, diabetes, asthma, heart disease, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been very healthy. My family has good genes, I guess. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox – but I haven't been seriously sick in… well, decades. I've had regular checkups with my previous doctor in the States, and everything was always fine. Would it help if I got those records sent over? It might take a few days, though.
DOCTOR: That would be… tedious. While I appreciate the offer, Ms. Sayar, previous records are rarely conclusive. Let’s focus on the present. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nothing. Not even wisdom teeth removed, believe it or not. I’ve just… been lucky, I guess. Or careful. Both, probably. Is this usual for a travel clearance letter? Because honestly, I’ve never had to explain my health history like this before. It feels a bit… invasive.
DOCTOR: "Invasive" is a rather dramatic term, Ms. Sayar. Thoroughness is simply good medical practice. I must assess all potential risks. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, insects – anything at all?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not a one. I can eat anything, take any medication. My husband used to tease me about it, said I was too good to be true. He had a shellfish allergy, though. Always had to be careful when we went out to eat. That’s why I remember asking about allergies, just to make sure. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting your time. I really don’t have anything medically wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, a lack of known medical issues does not equate to a clean bill of health. I still need to perform a basic examination. Please remove your shoes and socks. We’ll start with your vital signs and a listen to your heart and lungs. And please, refrain from recounting personal anecdotes; it doesn’t contribute to a medical assessment.
PATIENT: Fine. But honestly, if this is just to go through the motions… I don’t understand why you couldn’t have just written the letter to begin with. It feels like you’re deliberately trying to find something wrong with me. .
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Sayar, onto the table. Now, take a deep breath for me... Deep breath... and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Blood pressure is 128/76. Pulse is 72 and steady. Respiration rate is 16. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
