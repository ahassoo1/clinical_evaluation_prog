DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Petrimoulx, you say? Is that… Indian? Never mind. I just moved here. New doctor, that's all. Social thing, I think. Medicare wanted me to come. Old age, you know? Nothing wrong, wrong. Just… checking.
DOCTOR: Yes, Petrimoulx is Indian, originally. And it’s perfectly alright to just be getting a check-up, Mr. Szmyd. Medicare is very good about preventative care. “Just checking” is a very valid reason to be here. It’s good you’re being proactive about your health. To help me get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little bit about what you’ve been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Experiencing? Like… what? I work with faces, you know? Makeup. For the theater. Not so much lately, though. Theater is… dying. People watch the little boxes now. Phones. Anyway. I feel… old. Tired. Is that experiencing? Everything hurts a little, probably. Been that way for years.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Old” and “tired” definitely count as things you're experiencing, Mr. Szmyd. And aches and pains, especially if they've been ongoing, are important to talk about. It sounds like you've had a fulfilling career, though – working with faces and in the theater is wonderful. When you say "everything hurts a little," could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Doctors always want specific. It's… everywhere. Back mostly. And knees. Used to be able to… bend. Now it’s… creaky. Like an old door. And fingers, sometimes. Hard to hold the brushes steady. Is that what you want to know? Everything is just… less easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I want to know, Mr. Szmyd. It’s good you’re being so detailed, even if it's frustrating to describe. "Creaky" and "less easy" are very helpful. So, back, knees, and fingers – and it's affecting your ability to do your work, holding the brushes. About your back pain – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when I… stand too long. Or bend. Which is… all the time, if I was working, you know? Now… not so much standing. Sitting is better. But then the… everything gets stiff. It's just… old. Like I said. You don’t need to write all this down, do you? It's just… aches.
DOCTOR: I do need to write it down, Mr. Szmyd, but not because I don’t believe you, but because it helps me keep track of everything and make sure we don't miss anything important. It’s all part of building a complete picture of your health. And you're right, it's good to know that sitting is better, and standing makes it worse. Just to clarify – when the pain is at its worst, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you say you are?
PATIENT: Zero to ten? What is this, school? I don't do numbers. But… worst day? Maybe a… six? Seven? When I try to… lift something. Or get up from the chair. That first… push. Then it eases up. Not all the time, though. Sometimes it's just a… dull ache. Like a bad memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six or seven on those days. And a dull ache otherwise. That helps a lot, Mr. Szmyd. Don't worry about the numbers – just doing your best to describe it is perfect. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm. Let me think. The wife… she always took me to the doctor. Back then. I had… something with the blood pressure, maybe? High, I think. And the… cholesterol. Always something high. She liked to worry. I mostly just tried to ignore it. I don't remember the names of anything. She handled all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. It’s very common. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember the specifics – that's what I'm here for. Do you happen to know if you’re currently taking any medications for those conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications… Ugh. Pills. Yes. She made me take… a white one, every morning. And a little blue one, sometimes. For the… heart, maybe? I stopped taking them when… well, never mind. It's all a blur. I have a bottle somewhere in the kitchen, I think. Full of… stuff. Old stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill every morning, and a little blue pill occasionally. That’s a good start. We can definitely track those down. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Maybe a little… sniffly when the flowers bloom in spring. But that's everyone, isn't it? Nothing serious. The wife was allergic to cats. That was a problem. She loved cats.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Just a bit of springtime sniffles. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, lord. That’s… complicated. My mother… she died young. Something with her heart, I think. Father… he smoked too much. Lungs, probably. Lots of… sadness in my family. Not much healthy living. Mostly just… suffering. I try not to think about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds difficult, Mr. Szmyd. It’s alright if you don’t have a lot of details – heart problems in your mother and lung issues related to smoking in your father is helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoked? Oh, yes. For a long time. When I was younger. Everyone smoked back then. In the theater, it was… essential. Helped with the nerves. Stopped… when the wife said I had to. Too many coughs, she said. Ruined her furniture. It’s been… years. Decades.
DOCTOR: Okay, you used to smoke, but quit decades ago. That's very good. And finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. A little vodka. Mostly on the… holidays. Or when I'm… remembering things. Not much these days, though. It doesn't… taste the same anymore. It used to… help me relax. Now it just… makes me sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional vodka, mostly on holidays. Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That gives me a good overall picture of your health history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints and reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Joints… those will be bad, I warn you. Everything is creaky. But… go ahead. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are slightly diminished. Blood pressure is 145/85. A little elevated, but not critically high. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oof. There. See? Creaky. Like an old door. Can't go very far. A lot of pain. Stop if it's too much, I guess. It’s always like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. There’s visible crepitus with range of motion and some tenderness to palpation. Limited range of motion in both knees. Now, let's check your fingers. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: There. It’s… hard. Stiff. Not as good as they used to be. Used to be able to paint for hours. Tiny little details. Now… not so much. It hurts to bend them, you know? Especially this one.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild swelling and tenderness at the DIP joint of your right index finger. Range of motion is limited, and there’s slight discomfort with flexion. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it seems you're experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis, likely affecting your knees and fingers. The elevated blood pressure is also something we'll need to address. Would you be willing to have some blood work done to confirm these findings and check your cholesterol levels?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? Ugh. Fine. Whatever you think is best. If it will make you stop asking me about my aches and pains… yes. Do the blood work. But… can we get this over with quickly? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. It will only be a small amount of blood drawn. The nurse will be in shortly to take care of that. It will help us to confirm the diagnosis and create a plan to manage your osteoarthritis and blood pressure. In the meantime, I'm going to write some initial recommendations. We can discuss some lifestyle modifications, such as regular, low-impact exercise, weight management, and pain relief strategies. I also want to recommend a referral to a physical therapist who can help you with exercises to improve your range of motion and strength. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Physical therapist… more poking and prodding? Exercise… when I’m tired? Ugh. But… okay. If you think it’s best. I just want to… feel a little better. Less creaky, I guess. Write down whatever you need to write down. Just… no more needles, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I'll write an order for the blood work and a referral to a physical therapist. We can also discuss over-the-counter pain relief options, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're comfortable with those. We'll start with lifestyle modifications and see how you respond. Here's a summary of the plan: 1. Blood Work: To confirm diagnosis and assess overall health. 2. Physical Therapy: To improve range of motion, strength, and pain management. 3. Lifestyle Modifications: Regular, low-impact exercise , weight management, and healthy diet. 4. Pain Relief: Over-the-counter options as needed, with discussion of potential risks and benefits. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and assess your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… fine. As long as it doesn't involve more needles. And… can you remind me what ibuprofen is? I never remember these things. Old age, you know. It’s a blur.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. Ibuprofen is a common over-the-counter pain reliever, like Advil or Motrin. It helps to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Here's some information about it, including potential side effects and dosage instructions. Please read it over, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. I'm also going to print out a handout with some gentle exercises you can try at home. Remember, start slowly and listen to your body. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Exercises… Ugh. Fine. I'll look at them. Probably won't do them, but I'll look. No… I think that's all. Just… try not to poke me too much in the future, okay? And thank you… I guess. It's nice to finally have someone… looking at me. Even if it involves needles and poking.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make your visits as comfortable as possible. Remember, we're a team, and we'll work together to manage your health. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and review the instructions with you. If you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Szmyd. Take care.
PATIENT: You too. Don’t poke me too much. And try to remember my name, for once.
