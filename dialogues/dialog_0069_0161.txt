DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly? My niece, Layla, she mentioned something... about a pill you can take to prevent things. She said it was a good idea, just to be safe. I’m not sure I fully understand it, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask. I'm 55, single, and… well, I want to be careful. Is that enough of an explanation?
DOCTOR: Yes, Helaina, that’s a perfectly good explanation. It sounds like you're interested in learning about preventative medications, specifically regarding sexually transmitted infections, or STIs. Layla is a very thoughtful niece. To make sure I understand your needs and can give you the best information, could you tell me a little more about your current level of sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um... well, it's not… much. I haven’t been with anyone regularly for a long time. It’s been… years. A few dates here and there, but nothing serious. I just… I read things online, you know? And it made me think. It's better to be safe than sorry, even if it's just a possibility. I don't want to end up with something I regret. Does that make sense? I feel a bit silly talking about this, honestly.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Helaina. You’re not silly at all. It’s incredibly responsible of you to be thinking about this, and it’s always better to be proactive about your health. Many people have similar concerns, and it's perfectly normal to want to be informed. Just to clarify, when you say “a few dates here and there,” are these dates with new partners?
PATIENT: Yes, new partners. Usually just one or two dates with each person, nothing long-term. And… mostly men, if that matters. I haven't really… I haven't been with the same person for a long time, so it's always someone new when it happens. I hope that's not too much information. I just want to give you the full picture. And honestly, I'm a bit embarrassed about all of this. It feels strange talking to a doctor about my dating life.
DOCTOR: Helaina, you’re doing great. It's perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed, but this information is very helpful, and it’s all confidential. I appreciate you being so open with me. It allows me to give you the best possible advice. So, it sounds like you're sexually active with new male partners occasionally. We can definitely discuss options for preventing STIs. Before we dive into medications specifically, let's quickly go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single one, thankfully. I’ve always been… careful, I thought. But you hear stories, you know? And I’m getting older, and I figured it was time to be extra careful. I've had the usual check-ups with my general practitioner, but we don't really talk about… this stuff. That's why I'm here. Medicare covers STI testing, right? I remember something about that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Helaina. And yes, you are right to be thinking about being extra careful. Medicare does cover STI testing, and we can certainly arrange that for you today. It’s a good baseline step. Before we order any tests, let’s just quickly review some other parts of your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve taken antibiotics before, pain relievers, the usual things for a cold or flu. Nothing ever caused a reaction. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything serious in… decades. I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with a small pill every day. Does that matter? I always forget the name of it, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Helaina. It’s perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. No worries at all about forgetting the name; we can look it up in your records. High blood pressure does matter, as some medications can interact with blood pressure medication, so thank you for mentioning that. Let me just pull up your EHR... Ah, here we are. You're taking Lisinopril, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Lisinopril. You remembered! See, I knew my brain was still working somewhere. Thank you for looking that up. It’s just… frustrating sometimes. So, Lisinopril. And, um… nothing else. No other conditions, no surgeries… I think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Is that relevant? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Helaina. You’re providing me with important information, and I appreciate it. Having your appendix removed as a child is good to know, but not directly relevant to our discussion today. Okay, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2 I think. And her mother had heart problems. My father… he was healthy as a horse, honestly. Never sick a day in his life. My brother has arthritis, but that’s about it. Nothing major, really. Nobody ever talked about… sexually transmitted diseases, if that makes sense. It wasn’t something you discussed openly back then. It’s still a little awkward, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable, Helaina. It wasn’t something people discussed openly for a long time, and it's still a sensitive topic for many. Knowing about your mother’s diabetes and your family history of heart problems is helpful. Now, just a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. It wasn’t doing me any good, and frankly, I didn’t really enjoy it that much. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a bit of a… worrywart, honestly. I don't like putting things into my body that I don’t need. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Helaina. That's very responsible of you. It’s good to hear you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Okay, so we’ve covered a lot of ground. To summarize, you’re a 55-year-old female, sexually active with new partners occasionally, no history of STIs, taking Lisinopril for high blood pressure, no allergies, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, let's talk about preventative options. There are a few different ways to protect yourself. We can discuss pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a daily medication that can significantly reduce your risk of HIV infection. We can also talk about consistent condom use, which protects against a wider range of STIs. Would you like to start with PrEP?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s start with that PrEP thing. My niece mentioned that. She said it’s something you take every day. Is it… hard to remember? I already forget my blood pressure pill sometimes, and that’s just one! And… what are the side effects? I don't want to feel sick all the time. I just want something that will keep me safe, without making me feel worse. And… is it expensive? Medicare… does it cover that too? I’m sorry, I have so many questions.
DOCTOR: You're not at all asking too many questions, Helaina. These are all very important things to consider. Let's break it down. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a daily medication – a small pill – that’s highly effective in preventing HIV infection. You are right to ask about remembering it. Consistency is key, and it can be challenging. There are strategies to help, like setting reminders on your phone or linking it to another daily routine. We can discuss those. As for side effects, most people experience very few. The most common side effects are mild nausea, fatigue, or headache, which usually resolve within the first few weeks. Serious side effects are rare. We’ll monitor your kidney function and overall health with regular blood tests to ensure it’s safe for you. And yes, thankfully, Medicare does cover PrEP, though there may be a co-pay depending on your plan. We can have our billing department verify your specific coverage. Before we start you on PrEP, we would need to do an HIV test to confirm you are currently negative. We’d also need to do some blood work to check your kidney function and screen for other sexually transmitted infections. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… manageable. As long as the side effects aren't too bad. And Medicare covers it, that's good. The blood tests… yes, I’m comfortable with that. I suppose you have to know for sure, right? I just… I want to be safe. It’s been a long time since I thought about… any of this. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Can we do the blood tests today? And… what happens after that? Do I just… start taking the pill?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed, Helaina. We’ll take things one step at a time. And yes, we can absolutely do the blood tests today. I’ll have my nurse draw some blood. It will check for HIV, other STIs, and assess your kidney function and overall health. Once we get the results back – usually within a few days – we can review them together. If everything looks good, we’ll discuss starting PrEP. We’ll prescribe the medication, and I'll explain the dosage and any potential interactions with your Lisinopril. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to check how you're tolerating the medication and answer any questions you may have. We’ll also repeat the STI testing every three months, as recommended. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A reasonable plan. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I still feel a bit nervous, but… less overwhelmed. And… I appreciate you not making me feel silly for asking so many questions. Let’s get the blood tests done. I want to get this sorted out, so I can… stop worrying.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. It's my job to make you feel comfortable and informed. And you haven't asked too many questions at all. Excellent. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, come in to draw your blood. She’s very gentle and will explain everything as she goes. She'll also give you some aftercare instructions. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm good for now. Just… let me get the blood tests done. I need to know what we're dealing with, before I can think about anything else. Thank you again, Doctor Andraca. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. Maria will be right in. And remember, you can always reach out if you have any questions or concerns, even after the results come back. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
