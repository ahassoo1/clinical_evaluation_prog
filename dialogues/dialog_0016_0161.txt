DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Maskal, nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I come talk about… something to help prevent HIV. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest, but she said it was a good idea, and I trust her judgment. She called it PrEP, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright – lots of people come in with questions about PrEP. It stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and your friend is very smart to suggest it as a way to help prevent HIV. It’s a really effective medication. Before we talk about whether it's right for you, I’d like to get a better understanding of your risk factors and overall health. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds sensible. I don't mind answering questions at all. I just… I work as a parking attendant, you know? So, I’m around a lot of people all day. Different people. It's mostly just… being aware, I guess. But better safe than sorry, as they say. What kind of things do you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good you’re thinking proactively about this, Helaina. Being around a lot of people does increase exposure, even if it’s not directly concerning. I’m pulling up your chart now… okay, I see you're 55 years old and your insurance is Medicare. That's helpful. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious since. I get regular check-ups with my family doctor, Dr. Elias, and he always says I’m in pretty good shape for my age. Blood pressure’s always a little high when I’m at the doctor’s office, though – I get nervous! But he hasn't ever put me on medication for it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your overall health. It's common for blood pressure to be a bit elevated in a clinical setting - it's often called "white coat hypertension". Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a little girl, maybe six or seven, I had my tonsils taken out. That’s the only surgery I can remember. And… oh! Once, when I fell off a ladder while picking olives, I broke my wrist. I was in the hospital for a couple of nights for that, but it healed up fine. It was a long time ago, though. Late 70s, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture, noted. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother had… diabetes, I think. Type 2, maybe? She was diagnosed when she was older. And my father... he had heart trouble, towards the end. It was pretty sudden. And my brother, he has high cholesterol, he’s on medication for that. Other than that… not really. We weren't a family that talked much about health problems, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and high cholesterol. That's helpful to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions that might feel a little personal, but it’s important for me to get a full picture of your health and risk factors. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… yes. I am. Not… regularly, but yes. I've been single for a long time, and it's... it's casual. Mostly just companionship, you know? I don’t… I don’t use condoms every time. That's why my friend suggested this PrEP thing. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, but I suppose that's what doctors are for.
DOCTOR: It's absolutely okay, Helaina. You've done the right thing by being honest with me. It's very common, and I commend you for thinking about protecting your health. And your friend is very wise to suggest PrEP. To make sure PrEP is the right option for you, we need to rule out any existing HIV infection. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: I… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I mean, I’ve had general bloodwork done with my regular doctor, but I don’t remember ever having a specific HIV test. Is that… is that something they would have told me? I don't really remember the details of all those tests, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Sometimes those details get lost. We’ll definitely do an HIV test today as part of the screening process for PrEP. It’s a simple blood test. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes in the winter, but that's it. I used to take something for hay fever, when I was younger, but I haven't needed it in years. No, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the vitamin D, like I said. And occasionally, I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking pills whenever I can. My grandmother always said, "Too many pills will kill you before the illness does!" I probably inherited a little bit of her skepticism.
DOCTOR: That's a good grandmother! Okay, so just vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. That gives me a good starting point. Now, to make a decision about PrEP, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some lab tests to check your overall health and kidney function – those are important for this medication. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing. A physical exam and some tests… sounds good. Let's get it done. The sooner, the better, really. I don't like waiting around.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and do a quick abdominal exam. Then we’ll draw some blood for the lab tests. If you’ll just have a seat up here, we can get started.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. I haven't been on one of these in a while! Hope I don't need a boost to get up there.
DOCTOR: We'll help you if you need it. Okay, just lie back and relax. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given you were just thinking about it. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Everything sounds and feels good so far, Helaina. Now, we just need to get a blood sample for the lab tests. It'll just be a quick prick on your arm. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. A quick prick, I can handle that. I've had worse. Get it over with, really. Don’t like needles, but I'll manage. A good strong arm, you know, for a woman my age!
DOCTOR: You certainly do! Okay, just relax your arm. This will just sting for a moment. Just a little prick… okay, almost done… there we go. All done. Apply pressure to this for a few minutes and try not to bend your arm too much. The lab will test your kidney function, liver function, and run an HIV test, as well as some other routine bloodwork. Now, let’s go over the results when they come back. It usually takes a couple of days. Is there anything else you’re concerned about today, or anything I can answer for you before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just the waiting, I suppose. But I appreciate you being thorough, doctor. And for not making me feel silly about asking questions. It’s good to know everything is… well, sounds good, anyway. What happens if the tests come back saying PrEP is okay? What does that even involve? Pills? Shots? I'm not keen on either, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Helaina! PrEP is taken as a daily pill – it's a small, blue pill, actually. It's called Truvada, or Descovy – they both work very similarly. There is also a longer-acting injectable version now, but it's not as commonly used yet. Most people prefer the pill because it's easier to manage and more readily available. You’d need to take it every day, at roughly the same time, for it to be most effective. We’d also need to see you every three months for follow-up appointments to check for any side effects and to repeat the HIV test to make sure you’re still uninfected. And we'd also test your kidney function to make sure the medication isn’t causing any problems. Side effects are generally mild – sometimes a little nausea or fatigue, but most people don’t experience anything noticeable. Does that sound manageable to you?
PATIENT: Hmm. A pill every day… I suppose I can manage that. It’s better than a shot, definitely. And three months isn’t too bad for check-ups. But what if I forget a dose? What happens then? Is it a disaster? I’m a bit… forgetful sometimes, if I'm honest. It’s just how I’m wired. Don't want to mess things up.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Helaina! It's good you're thinking about that. Missing a dose now and then isn’t a disaster, but it’s important to get back on track as quickly as possible. If you miss one dose, take it as soon as you remember – as long as it's within 24 hours. If you miss more than one dose, you might need to use a condom for a while to protect yourself. We can also talk about strategies to help you remember – setting an alarm on your phone, using a pill organizer, or even linking it to another daily habit. And if you miss a lot of doses, PrEP might not be the right option for you, and we can discuss other prevention methods. The most important thing is to be honest with me about any challenges you're having so we can find the best way to protect your health. Don’t worry, we'll figure it out together. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, really. You’ve been very patient and explained everything clearly. I appreciate that. Just waiting for the test results now, I suppose. And trying to remember to set an alarm. A very good idea. Thank you, doctor. I think I’m all set for now. I'll see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. We'll get in touch as soon as the results are back. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
