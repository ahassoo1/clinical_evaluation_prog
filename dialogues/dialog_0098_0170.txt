DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get this life insurance thing done. They sent me over for an exam, that's all. Hope it doesn't take too long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Putney. A life insurance physical, alright. I understand wanting to keep it brief. We'll do our best to be efficient. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I'm… okay, I guess. I'm a lodging manager, so I'm on my feet a lot. Gets tiring, but it’s a job. I had some trouble with my knees a while back, but it's not too bad now. Other than that… not much really. I'm 49, if that matters. Divorced, been that way a few years now. I have Medicare. Does that cover everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, lodging manager, on your feet a lot… and some past knee trouble. 49 years old, Medicare… yes, that’s helpful. Medicare generally covers these types of exams, but we always verify. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about that knee trouble?
PATIENT: It was a few years ago, maybe five or six? I was lifting some boxes at work, and just felt a pop. Hurt pretty bad for a while. Went to physical therapy, did some exercises. It got better, mostly. I still feel it sometimes, especially if I've been walking a lot, or if the weather's bad. Nothing that stops me from working, though. I don’t take anything for it regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pop, physical therapy, gets better with rest… that’s good to know. And it doesn't interfere with your work currently?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. It's just a little ache sometimes. Like an old man ache, you know? Look, is this going to take long? I got things to do later. I just need them to sign off on the insurance, that’s it.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Putney. We'll keep things as efficient as possible. Just a few more quick questions to get a complete picture for the insurance company, then we'll do a brief physical exam. Have you had any other significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and all that. Nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago, but that was pretty quick. Other than that… I haven’t been to the doctor much, honestly. I try to stay healthy. I think that's it. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox as a child, gallbladder removal ten years ago… good. And you haven't been to the doctor much otherwise. That's helpful to know. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that's it. Really. I’m pretty good about staying away from medication.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. And no allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Never had any problems with anything like that. I can eat whatever, take whatever… well, except for the pills, like I said. Can we just get this over with? I'm starting to get a little impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. No allergies, no regular medications. We're almost there. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to check your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll fill out the forms for the insurance company. It shouldn't take long at all. If you could just hop up on the table for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get this done.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Uh… I think I'm about six feet… six foot even. And, uh… around 195 pounds, maybe? I haven't weighed myself in a while. Somewhere around there, anyway.
DOCTOR: Actually, Mr. Putney, the scale reads 174 centimeters – that's about 5 foot 8 inches – and 97 kilograms, which is about 214 pounds. Is that a significant difference from what you thought?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… yeah. I guess so. I haven't weighed myself recently, like I said. Maybe the scale's wrong? I usually weigh less… I used to be a lot more active, before the job. It’s been a stressful few years, you know? I probably gained some weight. It’s… it’s not a big deal. Just forget about it. Can we just finish this?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll note the current weight and height. Just one final quick question, Mr. Putney. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never have. Never will. Look, is there anything else? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. No smoking. That completes the exam. I'll fill out the life insurance forms now. I did note a difference in your reported weight and height versus what we measured today. It’s not necessarily a cause for alarm, but significant changes can sometimes indicate underlying health concerns. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with a primary care physician to discuss this further and ensure you're in good overall health. I can provide you with a list of local doctors if you'd like.
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I appreciate it. But I'm fine. Really. I just needed this insurance thing done. I don't want to bother with more appointments and tests. I'm busy. Just finish the forms, please. I'll think about it, okay? Just… finish the forms.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. The forms are completed and ready for your signature. Here you go. Please review and sign. I understand your time is valuable. However, I strongly encourage you to consider scheduling a follow-up appointment with a primary care physician. Your health is important. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
