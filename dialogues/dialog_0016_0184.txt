DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day. I want to talk about... well, lookin’ in the mirror. It's not what it used to be, and frankly, it's disturbin’. I want somethin’ done about it. Not interested in talkin' 'bout feelin's, just fixin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about changes you've noticed in your appearance when you look in the mirror and want to explore options to address that. “Fixin’ it,” as you put it. That’s perfectly alright – we can definitely focus on the physical concerns. To start, can you tell me specifically what you're noticing when you look in the mirror that’s disturbing you?
PATIENT: Disturbin'? Everything! The skin, for one. Saggin’ like old canvas. And… well, I got lines now. Deep ones. Used to have a strong face, you know? A proper face. Not this... wrinkled mess. And somethin' about the shape, it ain't right no more. It’s just… droopy. I don’t want to look like a dried prune, you understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’re concerned about changes in your skin’s elasticity – the sagging and wrinkles – and a general change in the contours of your face. It’s very common to be bothered by those sorts of changes as we age. You want to restore a more youthful appearance, and that’s a valid concern. To get a better idea of what might be going on, and what options we could consider, could you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve been noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, it didn't happen overnight, you think? It been creepin' up on me for… maybe five years now? Started with little wrinkles 'round the eyes, then the whole face started goin' south. My wife... she didn’t say much, but I could see it in her eyes. She always liked a strong lookin' man. Now? I don't bother lookin’ at pictures no more. It’s just depressing. Now, are you gonna do somethin' or just ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this has been bothering you for quite some time, and it’s understandably frustrating. And no, I won’t just ask questions all day. I'm gathering information to understand what might be the best course of action for you. Okay, five years of gradual changes. Have you noticed any changes in other areas, like sunspots, moles, or any skin sensitivities?
PATIENT: Sunspots? A few. I used to work outdoors, pile drivin', you know? Lots of sun. Never bothered with lotion or nothin'. Didn't have time for that. Moles? Not really. Skin sensitivities... sometimes itchy. Nothing major. Look, I’m a practical man. What can be done? Can you pull it tight again? Or somethin'? I don’t want a face lift if that means lookin' all… stretched. Just fix what’s droopin’. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of outdoor work with sun exposure and some occasional itchiness. And you’re understandably concerned about avoiding anything drastic like a traditional face lift. That’s very helpful to know. There are several options we could discuss, Mr. Trendler, ranging from non-invasive to minimally invasive. Things like dermal fillers, Botox, and laser skin resurfacing could address some of the sagging and wrinkles, and potentially improve the appearance of sunspots. We also have some newer treatments that stimulate collagen production to help with skin tightening. Before we jump into specifics, though, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your skin to assess the extent of the changes and rule out anything concerning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Humph. Exam. Fine. Get it over with. But don't be pokin' and proddin' all day. I got things to do, you know. And no promises I won't tell you if it hurts. Just look at the face, I don't need a full body inspection. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Mr. Trendler. Just a facial exam, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything I’m doing as I go. Okay. I'm noting some expected sun damage – some areas of hyperpigmentation and a slightly rough texture. The skin laxity is moderate, particularly along the jawline and cheeks, as you described. I also see some deeper wrinkles around the eyes and mouth. There are no immediately concerning moles or lesions. Overall, your skin shows signs consistent with sun exposure and aging. It is possible to address these changes with various treatments. Do you have any allergies to any medications or topical creams?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. Used to be a tough man, didn't get sick, didn't get allergies. But I used to use a cream my wife gave me, years ago. Called... Revitalift or somethin'. It made my skin a bit red, so I stopped usin' it. That the only thing I ever had trouble with. Now, what can we do about this droop? I want a solution, not a list of creams.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies except for a reaction to Revitalift cream. That’s good to know. And you're right to want to discuss solutions. Given your concerns and the exam findings, several options could be considered. Botox can help with wrinkles caused by muscle movement, particularly around the eyes and forehead. Dermal fillers can restore volume loss, which can address sagging and improve the contours of your face. We also have laser resurfacing options that can improve skin texture and tone. However, given your reaction to Revitalift, we would need to proceed cautiously with any topical treatments. Before we decide on a specific course of action, I’d like to discuss the pros and cons of each option, as well as potential risks and side effects. I also want to manage your expectations—while we can improve your appearance, we’re not going to turn back time completely. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Humph. Reasonable. Manage expectations? I'm a realist. I don't expect to look twenty again. But I don't want to look like a melted wax figure either. So, tell me about these… fillers. What are they made of? And will it hurt? I don't like needles, you know. Never been good with those. Get straight to the point, doc. No fancy words.
DOCTOR: Alright, straight to the point. Dermal fillers are gel-like substances injected under the skin to restore volume loss and smooth out wrinkles. Most fillers are made of hyaluronic acid, which is a naturally occurring substance in your body. It’s very safe, and your body will gradually break it down over time. As for the needles… it's not completely painless, I won't lie. But we use a very small needle, and we can apply a topical numbing cream beforehand to minimize discomfort. Most patients describe it as a slight pinching sensation. The procedure itself is relatively quick – usually 15-30 minutes, depending on how many areas we're treating. The effects are immediate, although there can be some minor swelling and bruising initially. It typically lasts 6-12 months, depending on the type of filler used. We could start with a small amount of filler in one area—for example, around your cheeks—to see how you respond. What do you think about that approach?
PATIENT: Cheeks… alright. Start small. I don’t want to look puffed up like a chipmunk. And what’s this cost? Don’t tell me a fancy price, give me a straight number. I'm a practical man. If it costs too much, I’ll just keep lookin’ in the mirror. And if I see any bruising worse than a black eye, I’m walkin’ out. Clear?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Mr. Trendler. No chipmunk faces, and no black eyes. The cost for a small amount of filler – enough to start with addressing some of the cheek volume loss – would be approximately $600 to $800, depending on the specific product used and the amount needed. That includes the initial consultation, the injection itself, and any aftercare instructions. Bruising is a possibility, but it’s usually minor and can be covered with makeup. We’ll take steps to minimize bruising, such as applying ice packs after the injection and avoiding blood-thinning medications. If you are interested in proceeding, we would start with a detailed discussion of your expectations and medical history. Then, we’ll mark the injection sites and apply the numbing cream. The whole process should take about 30-45 minutes. Do you want to schedule an appointment for that, or do you need some time to think about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. $800… it’s steep. But… I suppose I can afford it. Alright. Let's schedule somethin’. But no funny business. And I want it done quickly. I don't have time for all this fluff. Just get it done. What day do you have available? And I’m warnin’ ya, if it hurts too much, I’m standin’ up and leavin’.
DOCTOR: No funny business, I assure you, Mr. Trendler. We'll keep it quick and efficient. I understand your concerns about discomfort, and we'll do everything we can to minimize that. Let's see… I have an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at two… alright. That’ll do. Just make sure you’re ready to go when I get there. No waitin’ around. And I want a strong cup of coffee afterwards. This whole thing’s makin' me nervous. Never thought I’d be worried about wrinkles. Back in my day, men didn't worry about this sort of thing. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tuesday at 2:00 PM it is. And a strong cup of coffee afterward – I can certainly arrange that. I’ll have my assistant schedule the appointment and send you a confirmation email with all the details. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Trendler. We’ll take good care of you.
