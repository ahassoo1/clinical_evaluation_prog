DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s rather unpleasant, actually. My vision, you see, it’s gone quite suddenly. And my hearing… well, it’s fading. It all happened rather quickly, and frankly, I haven’t the time to sit here recounting every little detail. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Suddenly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, suddenly. Within the last… oh, goodness, I suppose a week? Maybe less. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I have a very important appointment this afternoon, and I simply haven’t the capacity to dwell on specifics. Is there anything you can do quickly?
DOCTOR: A week, alright. Well, “quickly” and thorough medical evaluations don’t always go hand-in-hand, Ms. Julie. But we’ll do our best. To get a better understanding, could you describe what you mean by "fading" hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It’s… muffled, I suppose. Like there’s cotton in my ears. And people seem to be… mumbling. Though, they do tend to mumble, don’t they? It’s just… harder to distinguish things now. And the vision, it’s just… dim. Like looking through a dirty window. I really must be going soon. Is a simple test possible?
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing and dim vision… alright. We can do some quick screening tests, yes. But these are just preliminary. To be thorough, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any dizziness or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Oh, goodness no. I haven’t time for such… frivolous noises. Dizziness… well, perhaps a little unsteady on my feet yesterday, but that’s probably just age. Honestly, doctor, I’m a very busy woman. Can we please expedite this? I have patients of my own waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Patients of your own, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, pediatric surgery. A very demanding field, you understand. I simply don’t have the luxury of sitting around discussing… trivial sensations. This is… inconvenient, to say the least. I trust you’re a competent physician? I wouldn’t want to waste my time with… amateurs. Are we getting anywhere with this, or shall I simply schedule another appointment for a more… focused examination?
DOCTOR: Competent is a rather… subjective term, Ms. Julie. But I assure you, I take your concerns seriously. However, rushing through an evaluation isn't in your best interest. Given the sudden onset of both hearing and vision changes, it’s important to rule out several possibilities. Now, have you experienced any headaches, fever, or neck stiffness alongside these changes?
PATIENT: Headaches? Occasionally. But who doesn’t get headaches? It’s probably just stress. Neck stiffness… no, I don’t believe so. I have excellent posture, you see. Honestly, doctor, this is becoming rather tedious. Are you certain you can’t simply… fix it? A quick injection, perhaps? I’ve seen it done before. I really must be going. What's the quickest thing you can offer?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, but a “quick fix” isn’t likely in this situation. Given your symptoms and your… reluctance to provide further details, I'm concerned about a possible neurological issue. A rapid change in both vision and hearing warrants a more in-depth assessment. Before we proceed further, let me ask: have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? Goodness, no. I perform surgery, you know. Requires a great deal of strength and precision. I assure you, my limbs are perfectly functional. This is all rather… insulting, frankly. Are you suggesting I’m imagining things? I'm a doctor myself, and I can assure you, I’m perfectly capable of assessing my own physical state. I think I’ve had enough of this. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I respect your profession, but dismissing potential medical concerns isn’t in your best interest. Given your symptoms and your refusal to cooperate with a thorough evaluation, I strongly recommend an immediate referral to a neurologist for a complete assessment. I will have my staff schedule that for you. Here is a referral note for Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist specializing in these types of issues. He's excellent. I also suggest you avoid any strenuous activity until you've been seen by a specialist. Do you have any questions before you leave?
