DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Ruocco, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Murry Ruocco. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so if we could just get right to it… this pain, it’s been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Pain.” Well, that’s… helpful. Where exactly is this pain, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… somewhere in here. It’s hard to say exactly. It’s not like a sharp pain, more… deep. And it gets worse when I take a big breath. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Deep chest pain that worsens with breathing… Right. And how long has this “deep pain” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it's barely there, other days… well, like today. I really can’t put a date on it, exactly. I’ve been doing a lot of work on the house, though. Lots of lifting. Could be that?
DOCTOR: Lifting. Of course. And what kind of lifting, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… wood. Big pieces of wood. For… repairs. The roof, mostly. I used to be stronger, of course. Now… everything feels heavier. It's just… work. I’ve always been a worker.
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I get a little tired, but I’m eighty years old! That’s to be expected, right? No cough, no fever… just this pain. And… maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but I figured that was just the heat. It’s been awfully hot lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your chest. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Is that good? It feels… strange. Like I’m not getting enough air. It always feels like that when someone listens to my chest.
DOCTOR: Sounds… congested. Not surprising, given your age and… activity level. I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse now. 150 over 90. Pulse is… irregular. Honestly, Mr. Ruocco, you really should be taking it easier.
PATIENT: Easier? What else am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait? I need to keep busy. But… irregular, you say? Is that bad? I don’t even know what that means. I just want to know what's causing this pain. And if it’s something serious. I haven’t got time for a long illness.
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a very subjective term, Mr. Ruocco. It could be muscle strain, given your…enthusiasm for home repairs. Or it could be something else. Look, I’m not going to spend all day going over every possibility. I'm going to order a chest X-ray, just to be safe. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a… what did you call it? A heart doctor? That sounds expensive. I don’t have insurance, you see. And I’m not sure I can afford all of this. Is the pain something I should really worry about right now? Can’t I just take something for it?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Ruocco, I'm not a charity case. And frankly, self-diagnosis is rarely a good idea. I'm ordering the X-ray. We need to rule things out. As for the cardiologist… well, that's up to you. But if you're having chest pain and an irregular pulse, it's probably a good idea. I can write you a prescription for some ibuprofen. Take two, three times a day. But if the pain gets worse, or you experience shortness of breath, dizziness, or anything else, go to the emergency room. Immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Ibuprofen. And… the X-ray. I understand. Emergency room… if it gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. I just… I just want to get back to work. Is it alright if I just get the prescription and go?
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Here’s the prescription. And the order for the X-ray. The radiology department is down the hall. Don't say I didn't warn you. Next!
PATIENT: .
