DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it’s this… tingling. It started a few weeks back, I think. In my hands and feet, mostly. It’s not painful, exactly, just… strange. Like pins and needles, you know? I just want to figure out what it is, if that makes sense. I don’t like feeling… off.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Teretha. “Pins and needles” is a very helpful way to describe it. And it’s certainly reasonable to want to understand what’s causing it. So, this tingling started a few weeks ago in your hands and feet. Has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. More often now than when it first started, though. At first, it was just in the evenings, after a long day of… well, you know, the mail route. But now, it’ll happen anytime, really. Even when I’m just sitting and reading. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just a few minutes at a time. But it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s becoming more frequent, happening even at rest, and it lasts only a few minutes at a time. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. Like, I don't feel it more when I’m cold, or after eating something… nothing like that. Honestly, the mail route is pretty demanding, lots of walking, being on my feet all day. Maybe that has something to do with it? I am getting older, after all.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Teretha. The demanding nature of your mail route is certainly worth considering. And it’s true, changes can happen as we age. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, I guess. But honestly, who isn't, right? And my balance feels… off sometimes, a little wobbly. I haven't fallen or anything, but I feel like I need to hold onto things more often when I’m walking. I just figured it was… old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and a sense of imbalance can certainly be concerning. It's good you're mentioning these things. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, let me see… the doctor always told me my blood pressure was a little high, but he never put me on any pills. Just told me to watch my salt. That was years ago, though. And I don’t think I’ve ever had anything else… no, I don't think so. I've been pretty healthy, all my life, really. I’ve never needed much doctoring.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but not currently on medication. That's helpful to know. And you haven't had any other significant medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but that’s about it. They just put a cast on it. And I've had all my vaccinations, of course. I try to stay up-to-date on those.
DOCTOR: Good, no major surgeries. And you keep up-to-date on your vaccinations – excellent. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tough one. My family… well, we didn’t talk much about those things, honestly. My mother… she died young, from something with her heart, I think. But she didn’t go to the doctor much either. And my father… he just… got old, I guess. He had some trouble walking towards the end, but I don’t know what it was. It wasn't like anyone talked about these things, you know? A lot of old Ukrainian folk weren’t big on doctors.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. It's common for medical history to be limited in those circumstances. We'll work with what we have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was terrible for your health, and I listened to her. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Maybe a couple of times a week. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in those.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Teretha. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I'm a good Ukrainian girl - I love my perogies! No allergies to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Okay, Teretha, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation, and take a look at your feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. I suppose it's necessary. The sooner we figure out what's going on, the better. I just hope it’s nothing serious. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Teretha. I’ll do my best to be thorough but gentle. Okay, your gait appears steady, though you mentioned a slight imbalance. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups, meaning full strength. And your sensation to light touch and pinprick is intact in both feet… However, I do notice some decreased vibration sense in your toes, bilaterally. That’s something we’ll want to investigate further. Your feet appear generally healthy, with no obvious signs of swelling or skin lesions. However, I notice some mild flattening of the arches. Alright, Teretha. Everything appears generally normal, but the decreased vibration sense and mild arch flattening are worth noting. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found on the exam, I’m concerned about possible peripheral neuropathy – damage to the nerves in your feet. It could be caused by a variety of things, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or even just age-related changes. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Blood tests, you say? Well, alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know why my feet are tingling. So, yes, blood tests are fine. What kind of tests are we talking about? And will they take a lot of blood? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: It does sound complicated, and I apologize for the medical terminology. Peripheral neuropathy simply means damage to the nerves in your feet and hands, which can cause symptoms like tingling, numbness, and weakness. The blood tests will help us rule out some of the more common causes, such as diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, and thyroid problems. We’ll also check your kidney function, as kidney problems can sometimes cause neuropathy. It will be a fairly standard panel, requiring about two vials of blood. I understand you don't like needles, and we'll do everything we can to make the process as quick and comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled. While we wait for the results, I also recommend paying close attention to your feet. Check them daily for any cuts, blisters, or sores. And try to avoid anything that might aggravate the symptoms, such as prolonged standing or walking. Do you have any trouble with your feet getting cold?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A couple of vials… that doesn't sound too bad. I suppose. I do get cold feet easily. Even in the summer sometimes. I always wear warm socks, even to bed. And I try to be careful, I really do. I don't want to end up with any problems. So, checking them daily… yes, I can do that. And avoiding standing… well, it's hard when my job is to walk all day. But I'll try my best. Do you think I need to take time off work? I don't really want to fall behind.
DOCTOR: That's good you're already taking precautions. Cold feet can be a symptom of neuropathy, and it's good to be mindful of that. Taking time off work is not immediately necessary, Teretha. However, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness or pain, it's important to let me know right away. We can then discuss whether a short leave of absence is warranted. For now, let's focus on managing your symptoms and seeing what the blood tests reveal. The lab is just down the hall. Once they've drawn the blood, it typically takes a few days to get the results back. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… try to be quick with the needle, alright? And call me as soon as you have the results, you promised. I don't like to be kept waiting. I guess that’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Teretha. We’ll do our best to make the blood draw as quick and comfortable as possible. And I promise I’ll call you as soon as the results are back. I understand your concern, and I wouldn't want to keep you waiting unnecessarily. The lab technician is ready for you now. Just let them know Dr. Abady sent you, and they’ll take care of everything. Thank you for coming in today, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day, Teretha.
