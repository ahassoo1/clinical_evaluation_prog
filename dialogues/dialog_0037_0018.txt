DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. Welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm… what does bring me in… Now, that’s a good question. It’s about… going to the bathroom, quite a bit, actually. More than usual, I think. It’s been… well, I can’t quite put my finger on when it started, truthfully. Just… recently, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, "recently" is alright to start with. Can you tell me a little more about this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I find myself… needing to go rather often throughout the day. And… at night, too. It’s… disruptive, shall we say. I wake up a couple of times, sometimes more, to use the facilities. I don’t believe I’m drinking an unusual amount of fluid, but perhaps I am? I really am not certain. It's just… more trips than I recall making previously.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased frequency both during the day and at night – that's nocturia, waking up to urinate. And you haven’t consciously changed your fluid intake. Do you feel like you're emptying your bladder completely each time you go?
PATIENT: Nocturia… yes, that sounds about right. A rather… clinical term, isn’t it? And no, I don’t believe so. It feels as though… a little remains, even after I’ve finished. Not a great deal, but enough to notice. It’s a slight… lingering sensation, if you understand. I often find myself going back shortly after, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: I do understand. That lingering sensation is important information. And going back shortly after to empty more is helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in how you're urinating?
PATIENT: Changes in how… hmm. That is… a specific question. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. The stream itself seems… normal, I suppose. It’s not painful, or difficult to start, or… forceful, or weak. Just… a regular stream. Although, now that I mention it, perhaps it’s not as… robust as it once was. But I attribute that to… well, to simply getting older, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's fair. It’s good you’re able to differentiate what feels normal for you versus a change. So, no pain, no difficulty starting, no forceful or weak stream – just a potentially slightly less robust stream. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no blood. And no pain in my back or sides, either. I have had… some general aches and pains, as one does at my age, but nothing specifically localized to my lower back or flanks. It’s more… a general stiffness, really. Nothing that I would associate with this… problem, if you will.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And you mentioned general stiffness, but no specific flank or back pain. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions. Let me see… I believe I have… slightly elevated blood pressure, though it’s generally well-controlled with medication. And I had a bout of… diverticulitis, some years ago. It required a brief stay in hospital, but I haven’t had any trouble with it since. Beyond that… I honestly can’t recall anything significant. My memory isn’t what it once was, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Elevated blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a history of diverticulitis that hasn’t recurred. What medications are you currently taking, if you recall?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… For the blood pressure, I take… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once daily. And… occasionally, I take Ibuprofen for the aches and pains. But not regularly, only when needed. That is all that comes to mind at the moment. I have a list at home, I am certain, but it does not spring to mind presently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril ten milligrams daily, and Ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been quite careful about what I eat and… well, about generally avoiding things that might cause a problem. No, no allergies that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had diabetes, I believe. Type 2, I think. And my mother… she had heart trouble, later in life. Nothing terribly specific springs to mind. They both… lived to a good age, actually. Quite healthy, all things considered. I don't recall any specific kidney problems on either side of the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with Type 2 diabetes and mother with heart trouble. No known kidney problems in the family. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also do a brief abdominal exam and a prostate exam. That’s to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. A thorough examination is always a good idea. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I’m… prepared for whatever is necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that’s not uncommon with some anxiety about being at the doctor. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little… firm, perhaps, but no sharp pain or discomfort. I do sometimes experience a bit of… bloating, but that’s likely just… digestion, I suppose. No, nothing unusual to report.
DOCTOR: Alright, no sharp pain or tenderness. I’m going to perform a digital rectal exam now to assess your prostate. This will help us evaluate the size and consistency of your prostate, and to check for any abnormalities. I’ll let you know what I find. Please just relax. Okay, all done. The prostate feels enlarged, which is common at your age, but it’s symmetrical and firm, which is good. I didn't feel any nodules or concerning abnormalities. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men as they age, where the prostate gland enlarges and can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia. The incomplete emptying you described also fits with this.
PATIENT: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia… yes, that sounds… rather complicated. So, it’s not… anything serious, then? Just… a larger prostate? And that’s causing the… inconvenience, if you will? I must admit, I’m rather relieved to hear it’s not something more… alarming. What does one do about it, if anything?
DOCTOR: It's good you're feeling relieved. BPH is very common, and while it can be bothersome, it's usually not life-threatening. It's not something to ignore, but it's often manageable. The goal of treatment is to relieve your symptoms and improve your quality of life. There are several options, ranging from lifestyle changes to medications and, in some cases, surgery. First, we can try some lifestyle modifications: limiting fluids, especially before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and regular bladder training – trying to urinate at scheduled intervals. We could also consider a medication called an alpha-blocker, which can relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. Another option is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, which can actually shrink the size of the prostate over time. To get a better understanding of the severity of your condition, I'd like to order a urine test to rule out infection and check your kidney function. I'd also like to order a PSA test – a Prostate-Specific Antigen test – to screen for prostate cancer, even though your exam didn’t find anything concerning. That’s just a standard precaution. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A thorough approach is always appreciated. Lifestyle changes… I can certainly attempt those. Limiting fluids and avoiding caffeine… that shouldn’t be too difficult. As for the medications… I am somewhat hesitant, if I’m honest. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible, if the situation allows. But I understand the need for careful consideration. The urine test and the PSA test… yes, please. Those seem… prudent. Standard precautions are always welcome. I trust your judgment entirely, Doctor. Please, proceed with whatever you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I completely understand your hesitancy regarding medication, and we can certainly start with lifestyle changes and see how those go. We don't have to jump into anything right away. I'll get the orders for the urine test and PSA test sent to the lab. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I’ll write down some resources on BPH and lifestyle modifications for you. It’s also a good idea to keep a voiding diary – a record of how often you urinate, how much you drink, and how much urine you produce. That can help us track your progress and identify any patterns. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve been… remarkably thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and… your explanation. A voiding diary… yes, that sounds… logical. I’ll certainly give that a try. And thank you for the resources. I’ll review them carefully. I think that’s all for now. Thank you again for your time and… your expertise.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you then. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
