DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Rosanova. It is… my sinuses, I think. They are… not feeling good. It has been… a little while now. I do not remember exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinuses. I understand. “Not feeling good” can mean a lot of things. Let’s try to narrow it down. Can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… It is… pressure. A lot of pressure. Here… and here. And… sometimes it hurts, like a… a dull ache. Not so bad always, but… when I bend over, it feels worse. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mikeisha. Pressure and a dull ache that worsens when you bend over—that’s very common with sinus issues. How about any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me see. I think… maybe my nose feels stuffy sometimes. Not always blocked, but… full. And… I have been very tired lately. But, I work long hours, so maybe that is just from that. I am not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, stuffy nose and fatigue. Fatigue can definitely be linked to a lot of things, and sinus issues can contribute. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. And no chills… and no cough. Just… the pressure, and being tired. Sometimes my head feels… heavy. Is that a symptom? I do not know what is normal with these things.
DOCTOR: “Heavy” is a good way to describe it. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. I… I do not think so. Everything smells… normal. I cook at home a lot, and I can smell the food. Maybe not so strong as before, but… I thought that was just getting older?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point. Sense of smell can change over time. Okay, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you had sinus infections before, or any problems with your sinuses in the past?
PATIENT: That is… difficult to remember. I have been sick before, of course. But… specific to my sinuses? I do not recall. I have not been to a doctor in… a long time. My husband usually handles things like that. I am sorry I do not have a better answer.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mikeisha. It's perfectly alright. We'll figure it out together. And have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I work very hard, out in the… the fields, with the machines. I am strong, usually. Just… this pressure is new. And I am… a little worried, maybe. Because I need to work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you're generally healthy, and I appreciate you coming in despite needing to work. Let’s do a quick exam, just to check things out. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your ears, and take a look at your throat and sinuses. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I trust your judgment. Please, do what you need to do. I hope it is not too serious. I have a family to support.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears. Your ear canals look clean, and your eardrums look normal. Now, open wide and say "ah." Your throat looks a little red, but no sign of anything major. Okay, and pressing here… does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Right… there. And… a little on this side too. It is not a sharp pain, more like… a pressure. Like squeezing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that tenderness is consistent with sinus inflammation. Your temperature is 98.7 Fahrenheit – that’s normal. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – an inflammation of your sinuses. It could be a viral infection, or potentially bacterial, but given the length of time it's been going on, we need to consider both. Given that you haven't been to the doctor in a while and your symptoms have persisted, I'd like to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything else going on, just to be safe. It's quick and painless. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Is… is something serious wrong? I thought it was just my sinuses. I do not like… too many tests. But… if you think it is important, Doctor, then yes. I will do what you recommend. I just need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mikeisha. It's not that I think something serious is wrong, it’s just a precaution. Especially with the fatigue and the persistence of symptoms, I like to have a complete picture. It's a quick scan, and it helps rule things out. It will take about five minutes. We can get it done right here in the clinic. While we're waiting for the results, let's start with some supportive care. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain and pressure. And a saline nasal spray several times a day can help to clear congestion. Also, make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids. Would you like me to write those down for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I am not good at remembering… all the different names. The pain relievers… and the… saline spray. And drinking water. Yes, thank you. I hope the X-ray does not take too long. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen – follow the dosage instructions on the bottle, and don’t exceed the maximum daily dose. The saline nasal spray, you can use it every 4-6 hours. And definitely stay hydrated! The X-ray technician is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take more than ten minutes total. Once it's done, the radiologist will review the images, and I’ll be able to discuss the results with you. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you, or any other questions you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. You have been very patient with me. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I… I appreciate it. I just hope it is nothing serious. I need to work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to get to the bottom of this. Don't worry, we’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll let you know as soon as the X-ray results are in. Let’s go ahead and get that X-ray done, then we can discuss next steps. The technician will explain everything to you before they start. I'll be right here when you get back. Just let me know if you have any trouble finding the X-ray room.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I will go now.
