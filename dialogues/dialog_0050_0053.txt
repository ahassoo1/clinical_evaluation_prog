DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're with Medicare, and we are located in a suburban clinic. Now, please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's all correct. Well, it’s my… going to the bathroom. It’s just gotten harder lately. Not a sudden thing, it’s been building for a little while, but now it’s really a bother. It takes me a long time to start, and even then it doesn’t always feel like I get everything out, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. Difficulty initiating urination, and a sensation of incomplete emptying… building gradually over time. That is bothersome, certainly. To get a clearer picture, could you describe for me how long "lately" is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe three months, I’d say. Three months ago it was just a little bit of effort, you know? Now, it feels like I’m… pushing. And sometimes I have to go back again a few minutes later. It’s a nuisance, really. I don’t like feeling like I can’t just… go normally.
DOCTOR: Three months, building gradually. And you describe needing to strain, and incomplete emptying leading to repeat visits shortly after. Do you notice any pain or burning during urination, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning either. It's not uncomfortable, exactly, just… difficult. Like something’s not quite letting go. It’s more effort than anything, and the waiting is the worst part. I don't like to be rushed, and this makes me feel rushed, even when I'm not.
DOCTOR: Very well. No pain or burning, just difficulty and the sensation of incomplete emptying. Let me just review your chart here… I see you’ve had a fairly standard medical history for someone your age, Ms. Yadao. Any past surgeries, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, that's all. And a wisdom tooth, years and years ago. Nothing else. No big operations, never. Just the usual doctor visits for checkups and things. I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly. I eat my vegetables.
DOCTOR: Tonsils and a wisdom tooth, both a long time ago. Routine checkups otherwise. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother, she lived to be 88, very strong woman. She didn’t have any trouble with this sort of thing, as far as I know. My father… he had some heart problems, but nothing like this. I had a brother, but he passed away a long time ago, young. He was healthy, as I remember. We didn't talk about bathroom things, if you catch my drift. It just wasn’t something we did.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother healthy to 88, father with heart issues, brother deceased at a young age. No known family history of urinary problems. Now, let's discuss your current medications, if any, and any allergies you might have.
PATIENT: Well, let's see. I take a baby aspirin every day, the doctor told me to after a little scare with my blood pressure last year. Other than that… nothing. Just vitamins, you know, a multivitamin. And no allergies, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything. Peaches give me a little itch in my mouth sometimes, but that's it. Not a real allergy, just a little tickle.
DOCTOR: Baby aspirin, multivitamin, occasional peach sensitivity… good to know. Ms. Yadao, to get a clearer picture of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will include listening to your abdomen, and a simple neurological assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Listening to my tummy and… a neurological thing? Is that serious? I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a little appointment with the hair salon later this afternoon, you see. They’re very busy.
DOCTOR: It is not a cause for alarm, Ms. Yadao. A simple check, just to rule out any underlying causes. It won’t take long at all. First, if you would please lie down on the examination table. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal here, no unusual sounds. And now, I’m just checking your reflexes. Good, good. And finally, just checking sensation. All appears normal. So, physically, everything appears to be in order. However, given your symptoms, and to rule out more serious causes, I would like to order a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume measurement.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That sounds… complicated. A urine analysis, I understand. But a “post-void residual volume measurement”? What exactly is that, Doctor? Does it hurt? I really don’t like things poking around… and I have that hair appointment! Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Yadao. A post-void residual volume measurement is a simple test to determine how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. It is not particularly invasive. A technician will use a small, sterile device to measure the volume. It may cause slight discomfort, similar to urination, but should not be painful. It will take approximately 15 minutes. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. Would you be amenable to proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Well… 15 minutes, you say? And it just feels like… using the bathroom? Not poking around? And the results in two days? That's… alright, I suppose. It’s better than letting it go on, I guess. But promise me it won’t take long, Doctor. And I need to tell the hair salon… maybe they can squeeze me in later if it takes too long. Do I need to do anything special to prepare for the test? Drink extra water or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Yadao, 15 minutes. It simply measures what's left after you urinate. No poking involved. And no, no special preparation is necessary. Just come with a reasonably full bladder, as you would for a normal urination. The technician will explain the procedure in detail when you go back. I will get this referral order printed for you now. I would also like you to keep a bladder diary for the next three days, recording the times you urinate, and the approximate amount of urine. This information will be helpful in assessing your condition. Here you are. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: A bladder diary, you say? Oh dear. Recording every time I go? It feels a bit… silly. But alright, I will do it. No, I don't think so, Doctor. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long at the salon! And thank you for explaining everything so patiently. It’s good to know what's going on, even if it is a bit bothersome. I suppose I’ll go make that appointment… and start keeping that diary. Do I need a special notebook?
DOCTOR: You're quite welcome, Ms. Yadao. No, a special notebook is not necessary. Any notebook will do, or even a simple piece of paper. Just record the time you urinate, and an estimate of the amount. We will review the results of the tests in a few days, and discuss the next steps. If you experience any sudden pain, fever, or inability to urinate, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I wish you well, and I look forward to seeing you then. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. .
