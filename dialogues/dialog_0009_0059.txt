DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been…slurred, lately. I don’t really know when it started, to be honest. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech. That’s definitely something we want to look into. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “lately,” can you give me a rough idea of how long you’ve noticed this going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a good question. Not very long, I don’t think. Maybe… a week? Two weeks, perhaps? It’s hard to say, truthfully. Things have been… a bit of a blur recently. I apologize; I’m not very good with dates. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Adyn. It’s common to have trouble pinpointing exact timelines. A week or two is helpful. And don’t apologize at all. Now, can you describe the slurring a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s like… my words don’t come out clearly. Like I’m trying to say something, but it’s all…muddled. And sometimes, I stumble over my words, you know? It’s not all the time, but it happens enough that my husband noticed. He’s the one who really encouraged me to come in. He says it’s more noticeable when I’m tired, maybe? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's intermittent, and your husband has noticed it more when you're fatigued. That’s good information. Has it been getting progressively worse over that week or two, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s been a little worse. Not dramatically, but… I feel like I’m having to try harder to speak clearly now than I was a week ago. It’s… subtle, though. It’s not like I can’t speak at all, you understand. Just… more effortful. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. More effortful is a good way to describe it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the slurred speech?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit… clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a few things lately. Nothing major, just… a bit more unsteady on my feet, maybe? And I've been awfully tired, even when I get enough sleep, if that makes any sense. It’s hard to explain. Like I'm just… drained, all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so clumsiness and fatigue alongside the slurred speech. I want to do a quick neurological exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please tell me what you’re doing as you go along, if you don’t mind? I get a little anxious when I don’t know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Adyn. I completely understand. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’ll gently tap on your knees and ankles with this hammer. This helps me assess your nerve function. Then, I’ll look into your eyes with this light to check your pupils and the back of your eyes. This can sometimes give us clues about neurological issues. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… manageable. Yes, go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to keep still. Just… gently, if you would? I’m not very good with… things near my eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. Your reflexes are a little slower than I’d expect, and I noticed a slight paleness in the back of your eyes. Nothing alarming, but worth noting. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Could you please touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Alright… finger to nose. Oh… that wasn’t very good, was it? I seem to be a bit off today. Is that… bad? I apologize. I’m normally much more coordinated.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Adyn. Don’t apologize at all. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty with this, especially if you're feeling anxious or fatigued. It does indicate some slight incoordination, but it’s not necessarily cause for alarm on its own. Now, let's check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but I haven’t been feeling very strong lately, if I’m honest. Just… a general weakness, you know? It's hard to explain. I'm not lifting weights or anything, if that's what you're thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. Your grip strength is a little weaker than I'd expect, but again, not dramatically so. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam I’ve done, I'm concerned about possible vitamin deficiency, specifically B12. The slurred speech, fatigue, clumsiness, and the findings on the neurological exam could all be consistent with that. However, there are other possibilities, and we need to do some blood work to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A vitamin deficiency… yes, that sounds… plausible. I do try to eat a balanced diet, but… my husband does most of the cooking, and I haven’t been feeling very hungry lately. Blood work sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Will that tell us for sure?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work will give us a much clearer picture. We'll check your B12 levels, as well as other vitamins and minerals, and also run a complete blood count to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order a CBC, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a B12 level. I'll also order a vitamin D level just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies to contrast dyes or medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I haven’t had any serious medical issues in quite some time, thankfully. I did have a bit of a rash once when I was a child, but my mother said it was just from poison ivy. Nothing to do with medication, I don’t think. Is that helpful? I truly don’t recall having any allergic reactions to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Adyn. No known allergies is helpful. Okay, I've ordered the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. You don’t need to fast for these tests, but try to drink plenty of water beforehand. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A few days is fine. Down the hall, you say? I’ll just… head down there now, then? Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. It’s put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, just down the hall. The receptionist will let them know I've ordered tests for you. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a little. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you experience any worsening of your symptoms while you’re waiting for the results. And Adyn?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just try to get some rest, and stay hydrated. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And if you feel any new symptoms develop – anything at all – call the office right away, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Rest, hydration, and call if anything changes. I will do that. Thank you again, Doctor Petrimoulx. I appreciate your help very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up.
