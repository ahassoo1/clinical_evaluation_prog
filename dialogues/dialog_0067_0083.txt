DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Pfennig, you say? A nice name. Well, I don’t usually come to doctors. But my daughter, she insists. Said I need... a card. A “get well” card. I am not sick, you understand. Just... low. A little down. She thinks a note from a professional might help. Is that… something you do here?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, that is absolutely something I do here. We address all sorts of concerns, and sometimes just talking things through and having a professional opinion can be helpful. It sounds like your daughter is very thoughtful. So, when did you start feeling “low,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been… building. Since the divorce, mostly. That was… oh, goodness, three years ago now? Four? Time slips away. She wanted things. All the things. A woman needs things, I suppose, but… it left me feeling a bit empty, you know? Not ill, just… diminished. Like a boiler with not enough water. Not working at full steam. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kammer. A significant life change like a divorce can absolutely have an impact on your well-being, even if it was some time ago. It’s not unusual for those feelings to linger. And you said it’s been building since the divorce. Has anything specific happened recently that’s made you feel more this way, or is it a gradual worsening?
PATIENT: Gradual, mostly. Though… my grandson, little Mateo, he started school. First grade. And his mother, my daughter, she won’t let me pick him up. Says I… “don’t understand the routines.” Says I’ll confuse him. He likes me! He asks for me. It's just… another thing. Another small cut. It’s not a big deal, I suppose. But it adds up, you see? Just… adds up.
DOCTOR: That sounds very difficult, Mr. Kammer. It's understandable that feeling excluded from important parts of your grandson’s life would be upsetting, even if it seems small. It sounds like you value your relationship with Mateo very much. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little bit about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, I sleep. What else would I do? But it's not… restful. I wake up a lot. Thinking. About… everything. Mostly about how things used to be. Before. Before she wanted everything. Before Mateo's mother… took over. I used to have a good sleep. Solid. Like a well-maintained system. Now? It's just… interrupted. Lots of tossing and turning. Do doctors care about sleep? Seems like a small thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, doctors absolutely care about sleep. It’s a very important part of overall health and can significantly impact mood and energy levels. It sounds like you're experiencing some disruption in your sleep, which is common when someone is feeling down or stressed. Do you find yourself feeling tired during the day, even after getting what you consider a full night’s sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, always. Always tired. I can get by, you understand. Years of working with boilers, you learn to push through. But it's… a drag. Like trying to run a steam engine on low pressure. Everything feels heavier. Slower. And the little things… they bother me more. Like the neighbor's dog barking. Or the price of coffee. Silly things, really. But they just… get to me. I shouldn't complain, though. I have my health, mostly. Just… low.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Mr. Kammer. When you’re feeling low, even small things can feel overwhelming. And it’s very common to feel irritable or have less patience when you're not sleeping well. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, it comes and goes. Some days I eat fine. A good plate of arroz con gandules, that always hits the spot. Other days… I just don't feel hungry. No interest. The food just… sits there. And sometimes, I eat too much. Comfort food, you know? Empanadas, mostly. Anything fried. Then I feel worse. It's a cycle, really. Good day, bad day. It depends on… well, I don't know what it depends on. Just… depends.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Fluctuations in appetite can definitely be a sign of how you’re feeling emotionally. Have you noticed any significant weight changes recently, either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Weight? No, not really. Maybe a few pounds here or there. Old age, you know? Everything settles in different places. My daughter keeps telling me I should watch it, eat more vegetables. She means well, I suppose. But she doesn't understand. A man needs his comfort. It's not like I’m wasting away. Just… solid. Like a well-insulated boiler. Keeps the heat in. Not exactly… trim. But solid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or sadness, or have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Well… sometimes. Some days I just look around and… what’s the point? I used to enjoy tinkering with things. Old engines, you know? Fixing things. But now… I don't have the energy. Or the interest. Everything feels… pointless. Like building a boiler when there’s no steam to run it. My daughter says I should take up a hobby. But what’s the point of a hobby if you don’t care about it? It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not like I’m crying all the time. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you've been going through a lot, and it’s understandable that you're feeling this way. Based on what you've told me – the low mood, the sleep disruption, changes in appetite, loss of interest in things you used to enjoy – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Now, I want to be clear, I'm not making a definitive diagnosis right now. But I do think it would be helpful to do some further evaluation to get a clearer picture. Would you be okay with me asking you to fill out a brief questionnaire that can help assess your mood and feelings?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? Hmm. I don’t like forms. Never have. Always feel like they’re trying to… trap you. But… if it helps. If it gets my daughter off my back. She’s been talking about me needing… help. But depression? That sounds… serious. I just feel low. Like a boiler with not enough water. Is it really that bad? I suppose… a questionnaire couldn’t hurt. But I warn you, I’m not good with questions.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you're not good with questions, Mr. Kammer. It's a very simple form, and I’ll be right here to help if you need it. It's just a tool to help us understand what you’re going through. It doesn't mean you have anything to be ashamed of. And you're right, it doesn’t mean anything is “wrong” with you. It just means we're trying to figure out the best way to help you feel better. Here you go. Take your time, and just answer as honestly as you can. We’ll go over it together when you're finished. No pressure at all.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect neat handwriting. My hands aren’t what they used to be. And I warn you again, I don't like questions. Too many… assumptions. "How often have you felt sad?" What does that mean, "often"? Is once a week "often"? This is ridiculous… This is a lot of questions. Are you sure this is necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. It is a lot of questions, and I apologize for that. But it helps me get a clearer picture of how you've been feeling and rule out other possibilities. You're doing great. If any question is unclear or you're unsure how to answer, please don’t hesitate to ask. We can skip it and come back to it later if you prefer. There’s no right or wrong answer, just your honest experience. Take your time. I’m right here if you need anything at all. And just to be clear, even if this form does suggest something is going on, it doesn’t mean you have to do anything you don't want to. We'll discuss all of your options together.
PATIENT: "Do you have thoughts of harming yourself?" What kind of question is that? I’m a retired engineer, not… not whatever this is implying! This is… invasive. I feel like I'm being interrogated. My daughter is going to be thrilled. She always said I needed to be more “open.” "Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?" Well, yes. But that’s because my back hurts, not because… not because of anything serious. There. Finished. Now what? Are you going to analyze my handwriting and declare me insane?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. I appreciate you being so honest, and I understand your frustration. I assure you, I'm not here to declare anyone insane. This is simply a tool to help us understand what’s going on and find the best way to help you feel better. Okay, let’s see… Based on your responses, it does appear that you’re experiencing several symptoms consistent with depression, such as low mood, sleep disruption, loss of interest in things you enjoy, and changes in appetite. However, it's important to remember that this form is just one piece of the puzzle. I want to discuss some options with you. We could explore medication, therapy, or a combination of both. We could also consider lifestyle changes, such as exercise or stress management techniques. Before we talk about those options, I’d also like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Medication? Therapy? Are you serious? I’m not crazy! I just feel… low. Like a boiler with not enough water, I keep telling you. I don't need pills or someone poking around in my head. Blood work… that’s slightly less offensive, I suppose. But I don’t like needles. And what if it shows something is wrong? I’m not ready for all that. Look, Doctor, I came here for a “get well” card, not a diagnosis. Can’t we just… forget about all this? Maybe I just need a vacation. Or a new grandson-pickup schedule. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Kammer. You're right, you came here for a different reason, and I completely respect that. And I want to assure you, I’m not trying to push anything on you. But as a doctor, my job is to make sure we're not overlooking anything that could be contributing to how you're feeling. And while a vacation or a new pickup schedule might certainly help, it's important to rule out other possibilities. The blood work is just a routine check to see if there are any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. It’s quick and relatively painless, and it can help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. And if everything comes back normal, then we can focus on other solutions, like addressing your sleep issues or exploring ways to improve your mood. What if, just for the sake of peace of mind, we start with the blood work?
PATIENT: Peace of mind… that’s a good one. I haven’t had peace of mind in years. Fine. Blood work. But I want a comfortable chair. And I want you to be quick about it. I don't like hospitals. Or… whatever this place is. And I want my daughter to stay away. No lectures. No “I told you so’s.” Just… blood work. And then I want to go home. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. You’ve got it. Comfortable chair, quick blood work, and no daughter. I will make sure she stays away, and we'll get you home as quickly as possible. Please, have a seat. I’ll let the nurse know to come in and draw your blood. It will just take a few minutes. And I’ll be right here the whole time. We're taking things one step at a time, okay?
PATIENT: One step at a time… that’s all I ever ask. Just… hurry it up. I have things to do. Even if I can't remember what they are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. I’ll let the nurse know to come in right away. Just try to relax. We're almost done. Nurse Rodriguez, could you please come in and draw blood from Mr. Kammer when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Nurse Rodriguez… probably young. Probably thinks she knows everything. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Nurse Rodriguez: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. My name is Maria. Dr. Pfennig asked me to come in and draw a few samples of your blood. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A few minutes, you say? Everything takes longer than they say. Fine. But be gentle. And don't faint. I don't need a mess. Just… get it over with. And don’t ask me how I’m feeling. I’m not feeling anything special.
DOCTOR: Nurse Rodriguez: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. And I won't ask you any questions unless you want me to. Nurse Rodriguez: Alright, this might sting for just a moment… Nurse Rodriguez: Almost done, Mr. Kammer. Just a few more seconds… Nurse Rodriguez: There we go, all finished. Just hold that bandage firmly for a few minutes. Nurse Rodriguez: You did great. I'll leave the samples with Dr. Pfennig, and she'll let you know the results as soon as they’re available.
PATIENT: Done. Finally. A little sting… she called that a little sting? Young people. They have no idea what pain is. So. What now? Do I get a medal? Or can I just go home?
DOCTOR: You absolutely deserve a medal, Mr. Kammer. You handled that like a champion. And yes, you can absolutely go home now. The lab should have the results back in a few days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, such as fever, chills, or excessive bleeding from the puncture site, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Before you go, I’d like to remind you that I'm here to support you in any way I can. Even if you decide you don't want to pursue medication or therapy, there are other things we can do to help you feel better, such as lifestyle changes or stress management techniques. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Stress management… As if that's going to solve anything. No. Nothing. Just… let me go home. I need a nap. And a strong cup of coffee. And don’t bother calling me unless it’s something important. I don't want to hear about stress management. Or anything else, for that matter. A strong cup of coffee… that's all I need.
DOCTOR: We'll see what the labs say. And I'll keep the door open, just in case. .
PATIENT: .
