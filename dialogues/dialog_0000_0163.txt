DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Good to meet you. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Dr. Batara, is it? A pleasure. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been… experimenting with my diet, shall we say. A bit too enthusiastically, perhaps. I’m eighty-five years young, and one tends to get… ideas. I’d like your opinion on whether I’m doing myself any harm. It’s rather a peculiar regimen, I must admit.
DOCTOR: "Peculiar," is one word for it, I suppose. At eighty-five, experimenting isn't always the wisest course of action, but alright. Tell me about this “regimen.” Be specific. What exactly have you been eating, and for how long?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began, oh, roughly six weeks ago now. I read an article – terribly unreliable source, in retrospect, a blog, I believe – about… well, about eating only foods that were available to people in the Victorian era. The premise was that our digestive systems aren’t equipped for modern processed foods. A bit far-fetched, perhaps, but it piqued my interest. So, I’ve been focusing on things like boiled mutton, root vegetables, oat porridge, the occasional bit of game if I can acquire it… and a lot of jellies. Apparently, Victorian England was quite fond of jellies. I’ve cut out almost everything else – no tomatoes, no citrus fruits, certainly no… anything from a packet. It’s surprisingly restrictive, as it turns out. And, if I may say so, rather bland.
DOCTOR: Jellies, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. Quite a lot of them. Aspic, primarily. Though I did attempt a lemon jelly, purely for research purposes, of course. It was… a disappointment. Far too modern in flavour. And, I confess, I may have gotten carried away with the gelatin. It was… substantial. My housekeeper nearly refused to serve it. She said it resembled something from a science experiment. A rather accurate assessment, in hindsight. I was hoping to maintain a robust intake of collagen, you see. For… vitality.
DOCTOR: Right. Collagen. And how have you been feeling since you started this… “robust” dietary change?
PATIENT: Well, physically, I haven’t felt ill, precisely. Though my energy levels are… diminished. A bit like a flickering gas lamp, if you'll pardon the analogy. And my joints, which were perfectly serviceable before, feel… stiffer. Perhaps the lack of certain nutrients? More concerning, if I may be candid, is the effect on my… mental acuity. I’ve always prided myself on my memory – crucial in my profession, you understand – but I’ve found myself… misplacing things. Forgetting names. It’s rather unsettling. And, truthfully, the constant monotony of the diet isn’t helping my spirits. It’s a rather grey existence, dietarily speaking. Perhaps a bit too Victorian.
DOCTOR: Misplacing things and difficulty with recall… that is concerning, particularly at your age. And a monotonous diet isn't exactly conducive to optimal brain function. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible. I am quite happy to be examined. I do hope it won’t involve anything… unpleasant. I've always been a bit squeamish, I must admit. And please, do feel free to ask if anything is unclear. My memory, as I mentioned, isn’t what it once was, and I wouldn't want to mislead you with inaccurate information. Where shall we begin?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll take a look at your reflexes, and I’ll do a basic neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. It won’t be unpleasant, I assure you. Just routine. And don't worry about inaccuracy – if I need clarification, I’ll ask. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits since starting this diet?
PATIENT: Ah, bowel habits. A delicate subject, but a pertinent one, I suppose. Yes, there have been changes. A rather… significant reduction in output, shall we say. And what little does emerge is… remarkably compact. It lacks… colour, and possesses a rather alarming firmness. I’ve been forced to increase my water intake, but even that hasn’t entirely remedied the situation. It’s… not comfortable, to put it mildly. And I fear it’s beginning to affect my concentration. One tends to be preoccupied with such matters, you see. A rather inelegant preoccupation, but unavoidable nonetheless. Perhaps this diet was a rather misguided endeavor.
DOCTOR: 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so for your age. And… yes, the constipation is concerning, particularly given your dietary changes. Compact stools and difficulty with bowel movements – that’s not good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little shallow. Now, let's check your reflexes. Knees are a little sluggish. Ankles are… somewhat diminished as well. This, combined with your reported memory issues and the constipation… It’s a constellation of symptoms that’s making me think we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate further? That sounds… rather alarming. Is it something serious, Doctor? I confess, I hadn't anticipated such a comprehensive… response to a peculiar diet. Perhaps I should have consulted you before embarking on this Victorian folly. I am rather reliant on my faculties, you see. My work demands it. I'm currently restoring some old film footage - a rather intricate process, requiring considerable concentration and attention to detail. And if my memory continues to decline… well, it wouldn't be a pretty sight. What sort of investigation did you have in mind? Blood tests? A… scan of some sort? I'm not particularly fond of enclosed spaces.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine, let's not panic. “Alarming” isn’t necessarily the right word. But your symptoms do warrant further investigation. We’re going to start with some blood tests. A complete blood count to rule out anemia, a metabolic panel to check your electrolyte levels and kidney function, and a thyroid panel, as thyroid issues can cause constipation and cognitive problems. We’ll also need to check your vitamin B12 levels – a deficiency can certainly cause memory loss and neurological symptoms. And, yes, a vitamin D level wouldn't hurt, especially given your limited dietary intake. As for scans… I'm not immediately ordering a brain scan. Let’s see what the blood tests reveal first. If they are inconclusive, we may need to consider further imaging, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. No need to worry about enclosed spaces just yet. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… remarkably sensible, Doctor. A thorough approach, which I appreciate. Blood tests are… tolerable, I suppose. Far less daunting than a scan of the brain. I do have a slight aversion to medical procedures, you see, though I try to remain stoic. And yes, the vitamin deficiencies are a likely culprit, given the… restricted nature of my diet. I was rather focused on the historical accuracy, and neglected the nutritional aspects. A foolish oversight, in retrospect. When can I expect the results? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Perhaps… resuming a more conventional diet? I confess, I’m beginning to yearn for a simple tomato. Or a piece of citrus fruit. A craving I hadn't anticipated.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll order the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get them done quickly. It usually takes 24 to 48 hours for the results to come back. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. And yes, absolutely. Immediately resume a more conventional diet. Stop the Victorian experiment, as it were. Introduce a wider variety of foods, including fruits and vegetables. Increase your fiber intake – whole grains, legumes, those sorts of things. And drink plenty of water. As for waiting for the results… try not to dwell on it. Focus on enjoying a more palatable diet and getting back to your film restoration. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, significant weight loss, or a sudden change in your mental state – call us immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly. Stop the Victorian experiment. Resume a conventional diet. Increase fiber and water intake. And contact you immediately should any alarming symptoms arise. I believe I’ve absorbed those instructions. A simpler regimen, and a less… historically accurate one, but a considerably more sensible course of action. Thank you, Doctor Batara. You’ve been most reassuring. And I apologize for the… peculiar nature of my predicament. It seems my enthusiasm occasionally outstrips my common sense. I believe that concludes our consultation?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vantine, I think it does. And don't apologize for your… enthusiasm. It's good to have interests, just perhaps not ones that lead to constipation and memory loss. Get back to your film, and please, call if you have any concerns. And… perhaps stick to modern cuisine from now on.
