DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I am Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the clinic. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this unsteadiness I’ve been experiencing. It’s difficult to explain precisely. I just… feel off-balance sometimes. It’s been troubling me, and I thought it best to have it checked. I apologize if that isn’t very clear. It's hard to recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: "Off-balance" is perfectly acceptable, Ms. Snerling. It's good you came in to get it evaluated. When you say it's difficult to recall when it started, can you give me a general timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A timeframe… Let me think. Perhaps… within the last few months? It’s all a bit hazy, truthfully. My husband… passed away a little while ago, and things haven’t been quite as… ordered since then. If that makes any sense. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: I understand life events can certainly disrupt routines, Ms. Snerling. It doesn't necessarily need to be precise. Within the last few months is sufficient. Now, can you describe what this unsteadiness feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a constant thing. It comes and goes. Sometimes I just feel a little wobbly, like I might stumble. Other times… it feels more like the room is swaying, but I know it isn’t. It's… disconcerting, to say the least. It doesn't happen with every step, and it’s not always after strenuous activity. It just… happens. And truthfully, I haven't noticed any particular pattern to it. I hope that clarifies anything.
DOCTOR: So, intermittent unsteadiness, sometimes feeling wobbly, other times a sensation of the room spinning. And you haven’t identified any triggers or patterns. Are you experiencing any other symptoms with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. Let me consider. Sometimes… I get a little dizzy, but I’ve always been prone to mild dizziness. I also feel a little… fatigued, but again, that could be… a great many things. It’s difficult to separate what’s related and what isn't, if that makes sense. I don't believe so, otherwise. No headaches, no nausea… just the unsteadiness and the occasional feeling of being tired.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and occasional dizziness alongside the unsteadiness. I see. Now, let's move onto some general medical questions, Ms. Snerling. Do you have any known medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Known medical conditions… I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major, as I recall. My doctor back home – in Louisiana – kept me quite healthy. Aside from that… no, I don't believe so. I’ve always been relatively… robust, if that's the right word. My husband always said I was a strong one. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history. That is… helpful. And yes, insurance information is always relevant. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that much I recall. And… …when I broke my wrist a few years back, I was briefly hospitalized, but it was a very minor procedure. A simple fracture, quickly healed. Nothing of significant consequence. Otherwise… I don’t believe so. I generally try to avoid hospitals, if I can.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy in childhood, simple wrist fracture. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a bit complicated. My mother… she had some heart trouble, as I recall. And my father… he suffered from high blood pressure. But they both lived to a fairly ripe old age, despite their ailments. I don't recall any history of neurological problems or anything similar on either side of the family. It's… hazy, to be honest. We weren’t particularly close, and medical details weren't often discussed. I apologize for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Snerling. These things aren’t always readily available. Maternal history of heart trouble, paternal history of hypertension. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine at Christmas. And recreational drugs… that's simply not my style. I worked very hard to maintain a respectable life. I spent many years working on oil rigs, you see, and that sort of behaviour simply wasn't… tolerated. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, if that clarifies anything.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, lastly, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not currently. I stopped taking my vitamins a few months ago, when this… unsteadiness began. I thought perhaps they were interacting with something, but… it's difficult to say. As for allergies… I have a mild sensitivity to bee stings, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. No known drug allergies. I always prided myself on being a rather… uncomplicated patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. We will assess your neurological function, check your balance and coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. I trust your professional judgement completely. Please, proceed as you deem necessary. I just… want to find out what’s causing this, if you can. It’s quite unsettling, to say the least. I am ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit on the examination table. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths through your mouth. Breathe in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. 130/80. Within normal limits. Now, I'm going to assess your neurological function. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Follow my finger… to the left… to the right… up… down… Good. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Good. Now, please push against my hands. Good. Now, we'll test your balance. Please stand with your feet together, and close your eyes. Hmm. A slight waver. And finally, I'm going to perform a Romberg test. Please stand with your feet together, eyes closed, and keep your arms at your sides. A mild unsteadiness noted. Alright, Ms. Snerling, you can sit back down.
PATIENT: Oh… Was everything alright, Doctor? Did you find anything… concerning? I confess, I’m rather nervous. It feels strange to be poked and prodded, you see. I understand you need to perform these tests, of course, but it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Your neurological exam was largely within normal limits, Ms. Snerling. However, I did note mild unsteadiness with the Romberg test and a slight waver in your balance. This, combined with your symptoms of intermittent unsteadiness and dizziness, suggests a possible inner ear disturbance or, less likely, a mild proprioceptive deficit. To rule out more serious causes and to obtain a clearer picture, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an MRI of the brain. We will also perform a Dix-Hallpike test to assess for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV.
PATIENT: An MRI… and a blood test? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? Is it something… worrisome? I must admit, I’m not particularly fond of hospitals or… procedures. And a deficit… that sounds rather alarming. Perhaps it’s just… stress? Or fatigue, as I mentioned? I’ve had a rather trying time lately, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it is standard procedure to rule out all possibilities. I understand your anxiety, but the tests themselves are relatively non-invasive. The blood test is routine, and the MRI, while involving a scanner, is painless. We are not assuming the worst; we are gathering information. While stress and fatigue can contribute to dizziness, your symptoms warrant further investigation, given their persistence. I want to be thorough. I will schedule the tests for you immediately. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sudden movements, ensuring adequate hydration, and getting sufficient rest. I'll also prescribe a course of meclizine, an antihistamine that can help alleviate the dizziness. It's important to remember that many possible causes are benign. We'll discuss the results as soon as they become available.
PATIENT: Oh… very well, Doctor. If you believe it’s necessary… I suppose I must trust your judgement. Adequate hydration… and rest… yes, I can certainly manage that. And meclizine… is that a strong medication? I’m always rather cautious about taking anything, you see. Thank you, Doctor. For being thorough… and for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring, to know you’re taking this seriously. I just… want to feel like myself again. When should I expect to hear back about the tests?
DOCTOR: Meclizine is a relatively mild antihistamine, Ms. Snerling, often used for motion sickness and dizziness. It may cause some drowsiness, so avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. As for the test results, the blood work should be available within 24-48 hours, and the MRI results typically take 3-5 business days. My office will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the unlikely event of worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, blurred vision, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of your body – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You’ve been… exceptionally helpful. And thorough, as you said. I… I just hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey. I shall await your call.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Snerling. Get some rest, and don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
