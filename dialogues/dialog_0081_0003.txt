DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s my hand. It shakes. Been shaking for…well, a while now. It’s annoying, is what it is. Makes it hard to…hold things. You know, normal stuff.
DOCTOR: A while now… could you be a bit more specific, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, specific? It started…sometime after Millie passed. Maybe a few months? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It just…started. And it hasn't gone away. Is that specific enough for ya? Really, I haven’t noticed it getting worse, just…always there. It’s a nuisance, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “shaking,” is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant-ish. It’s not like a full-blown tremor all the time, but it's always there, kinda. Like a little…vibration. And it gets worse when I try to do something precise, you know? Holding a fork, writing…even turning a doorknob sometimes. It’s embarrassing, frankly. Used to have such steady hands. Directed a whole picture, I did. Now look at me.
DOCTOR: I see. And is this shaking limited to your right hand, or does it affect your left as well?
PATIENT: Mostly the right. Left hand's okay, thankfully. Though sometimes, when I'm really tired, I think I feel a little…flutter in it. But honestly, could just be my imagination. I’m an old man, what do you expect? My body's falling apart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I get tired, easily. But that’s just…old age. Millie always said I was a bit of a napper. And my memory ain't what it used to be. But that's…normal, isn't it? Look, I don’t have time for a whole list of ailments. Just my hand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, a comprehensive assessment is necessary. Fatigue and memory changes can be relevant. Have you experienced any stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Sometimes, yeah. My knees, mostly. But who doesn't have stiff knees at my age? It’s the weather, probably. Damp days are the worst. Honestly, I’m not sure what you’re getting at here. Are you saying something's seriously wrong with me? Because I don’t have time for… all this.
DOCTOR: We’re simply gathering information, Mr. Baide. Now, have you noticed any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Changes in my speech? What are you talking about? I’m talking perfectly fine, aren’t I? Maybe a little…gruff, but that’s just my voice. Been this way my whole life. Look, I directed actors, alright? I know good communication when I hear it. And I’m communicating just fine. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, boy. Where do I even begin? My mother…she had arthritis, I think. Bad hands. Lots of complaining. My father…he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life. Millie’s side…her brother had something with his heart, I think. But that was years ago. Honestly, it was a big family. I barely remember half of them. It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any recent hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Medications? Just what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure. Little white pills. Can’t remember the name. And…no hospitalizations. Not recently. Had my gallbladder out, years ago. That’s about it. Look, I'm a relatively healthy man for my age, alright? This hand is just…a nuisance.
DOCTOR: If you’ll permit me, I’d like to perform a quick neurological examination. Just to assess the tremor and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I've got things to do. And don't poke and prod too much, alright? I bruise easily. It's another delightful consequence of getting old. Just…hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, relax your hand. Now, can you reach out and touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: There. See? Shaky. It's always like that. What's the point of all this anyway? It's obviously shaking. Can we just get to the…solution? Whatever that is.
DOCTOR: Now, let me check your reflexes. Just relax your arm… good. And relax… yes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but symmetrical bilaterally. There is a resting tremor present in the right hand, as you’ve described. No focal weakness is appreciated. Do you feel any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just…frustration. It feels…weak, sometimes. Like I can’t quite control it. But no pain. Honestly, I just want it to stop. Is there a pill for this? A shot? Something? I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like this.
DOCTOR: Based on your symptoms and the examination, it's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. The most likely possibility, given your age and presentation, is essential tremor. However, other conditions could be contributing. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying metabolic issues, and possibly a thyroid panel. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and possible further testing, like a dopamine transporter scan. It's important to get a clear diagnosis before starting any treatment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests, scans, referrals… honestly, it’s always something. Look, I’m eighty years old. I don’t want to spend my remaining time running around getting poked and prodded by doctors. Can’t you just give me something to calm the shaking? A pill, anything? I don’t need a “clear diagnosis,” I need a solution. This is ridiculous. Just…write me a prescription. For whatever you have. And let me get out of here. I’ve wasted enough of my day already.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is irresponsible and potentially harmful. However, given your insistence, I can prescribe a low dose of propranolol, a beta-blocker sometimes used to manage tremor symptoms. But I must stress that this is not a long-term solution, and it’s essential you follow up with a neurologist as soon as possible. Also, be aware of potential side effects, such as low blood pressure and fatigue. I will also provide you with a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. The paperwork will be at the front desk. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever. Just…thank you. I guess. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need a nap. And maybe a stiff drink. This whole experience has been thoroughly exhausting. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Baide. And please, schedule that neurology appointment. .
