DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been acting up again. Seems to get higher and higher, and my daughter, bless her heart, told me I needed to come get it checked. It’s been bothering me for a while now, but I mostly just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. It's good you came in. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address. And it’s wise of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. When you say “acting up,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I get these headaches sometimes, mostly at the back of my neck. And I feel kinda… dizzy, like the room’s spinning a little. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. Mostly when I’ve been on my feet too long, baking, you know? It just feels… off. I don’t really know how to explain it better than that.
DOCTOR: I understand. Headaches and dizziness can be concerning. It's helpful you've noticed it’s more prominent when you’ve been on your feet for a while. Could you describe the headaches a bit more?
PATIENT: They’re not sharp pains, Doctor. More like a dull ache, all across the back of my head and sometimes in my neck too. It feels… tight, almost like someone's squeezing it. And like I said, it comes and goes. Some days I don't even notice it. Other days… well, other days I just want to lie down. Baking's my life, you know? Don’t want nothin' to stop me from that.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that so clearly, Venna. That gives me a good idea of what you’re experiencing. It sounds like a tension-type headache, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, has this been a recent change, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been goin' on for a while now. Years, I reckon. But it's been worse lately. I just figured it was my age. Gettin' old ain’t easy, you know? But my daughter, she said I shouldn't just ignore it. She’s a smart girl, that one. Works with computers, somethin’ complicated. Always tellin’ me to get things checked out.
DOCTOR: It's good you have such a conscientious daughter. And she's right to encourage you to get checked out – even if it's been a long-term issue, things can change. Let's talk about your overall health a little bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… the usual aches and pains of gettin' old. My arthritis acts up in my hands sometimes, makes bakin' a little harder, but nothin’ a good warm water soak can’t fix. And my eyesight ain't what it used to be, that’s why I got these glasses. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I always been a hard worker, and I think that’s kept me goin'.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. Staying active is certainly beneficial. And it's helpful to know about the arthritis and vision changes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. And sometimes a little bit of vitamin D, my daughter gets me those. She says I don't get enough sun. Other than that, nothin’. I don’t like takin’ a lot of pills if I can help it. Always figured natural was best, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural remedies, Venna. It’s good to be mindful of what you’re taking. Before we move on to a physical exam, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My mama, she passed when I was young. I don’t remember her havin’ much of anything. My daddy, he lived a long time. I think he had some trouble with his heart towards the end, but I don't really know much about it. A lot of folks in my tribe, they had… well, problems with sugar, I think. But I don't know the details, if that makes sense. It wasn’t somethin’ we talked about much. Folks just dealt with things, you know?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Venna. It’s common for family medical history to be less documented in some families. Any information you do recall is helpful, and we can work with that. Now, would you mind if I took your blood pressure and listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: No, go right ahead, Doctor. I ain’t got nothin’ to hide. Just get it over with, if you don’t mind. I got a pie crust needin' rolled.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. We’ll be as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, as your daughter suspected. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. I'm also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you notice that swelling yourself?
PATIENT: Well, now. That ain't good, is it? A bit elevated, you say? I do sometimes notice my ankles are kinda puffy at the end of the day, especially when it's hot. I just figured it was the heat. I been standin' on my feet all day bakin', like I said. I mostly just put my feet up when I can. Is that murmur somethin’ serious, Doctor? You're makin’ me nervous now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing those changes, Venna. And it’s perfectly natural to be concerned when you hear about things like murmurs. A murmur doesn’t automatically mean something serious. It just indicates an unusual sound during your heartbeat. It could be benign, or it could be a sign of a valve issue. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work, including a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. We'll also want to do a urinalysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Oh, Lord. Well, I guess if you think it's necessary. I don't like goin' to the lab, but I don’t want nothin' to stop me from bakin', either. My daughter can take me, I reckon. She’s good at dealin’ with all that medical stuff. Just tell me what I gotta do. And how long will it take to get the results? I got orders for a pecan pie comin’ up next week.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of your daughter to offer assistance, Venna. The tests are relatively straightforward. The EKG is quick and painless - it just involves placing some sticky pads on your chest. The blood work will require a small sample of blood, and the urinalysis just involves providing a urine sample. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I'll have my staff schedule you for the tests as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your salt intake and staying well-hydrated. It's also important to continue monitoring your blood pressure at home if possible. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never thought I'd need one. My daughter might have one, though. She's always buyin' gadgets. I reckon I’ll ask her. Salt, huh? I do like a little salt in my pie crust, but I guess I can cut back. Everything in moderation, right? I’m mostly just worried about gettin' all this done before the pecan pie orders come in. Folks been lookin' forward to 'em all summer.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable approach, Venna. And I understand your concern about the pecan pie orders! We’ll work as quickly as possible to get this sorted out. I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication to start while we await the test results. It’s important to start it even before we know all the answers, to help prevent any potential complications. It's a common medication with minimal side effects, but it's always best to start low and go slow. My staff will also provide you with instructions on how to take the medication and what to watch out for. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Never had any trouble with any pills before. Though, like I said, I don't take 'em much. Mostly just ibuprofen when my arthritis acts up. Sounds good about the prescription, though. If it helps me keep bakin', I'm all for it. Just hope it don't make me too sleepy. I gotta get up early to get those pies in the oven! Is that all for today, Doctor? I really do need to get goin'. That pie crust ain't gonna roll itself, you know.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Venna – that pie crust won’t roll itself! So, to summarize, we've discussed your elevated blood pressure, headaches, and dizziness. We’ve ordered an EKG and some blood work, and I’m writing a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication. My staff will schedule your lab tests and provide you with instructions on medication and monitoring. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You explained everything pretty well. Just… thank you for listenin’ to me. It’s good to know somebody’s takin’ my concerns seriously. Alright, then. I guess I’ll be seein’ you. And tell your staff to be gentle with that needle when they draw my blood, okay? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I assure you, my staff is very experienced and gentle. We’ll do our best to make the process as comfortable as possible. Please, take care, and enjoy rolling that pie crust. And if you have any questions or concerns that come to mind later, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day.
