DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Have a seat. Seventy years old, Somali… hmm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Thank you, Doctor… Batara, yes? It’s… about maybe having a baby. My wife… she wants. I am… old, yes? But she says it is okay. We just want to… make sure everything is alright first. It is… a plan, you see. A big plan.
DOCTOR: A plan, you say. Well. That is… unexpected. Seventy years old… and planning to start a family. Alright. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. It’s good you’re thinking about this proactively. But there are… many things to consider. First, let me just clarify. You and your wife are considering natural conception, or are you looking into assisted reproductive technologies?
PATIENT: Hmm? Assisted… what? No, no technology. Just… the normal way. If that is… possible. We haven’t… tried yet. That is why we are here. To ask… is it safe? For my wife, and… for the baby, if we are lucky. I don’t understand all the… the science things. Just want to be sure. It has been a long time… since I thought about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Natural conception. Well, Mr. Carlotta, let's be frank. At seventy, the chances of successful conception are… extremely low. And even if conception were to occur, there are significant risks to both your wife and the potential child. But we won’t dismiss your plan out of hand. We need to assess your overall health, and your wife’s, to even begin to discuss what those risks might be. Let’s start with you. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Let me think. I have… old knees. They ache sometimes. And my back… not so good in the mornings. The doctor… a long time ago… said something about pressure. High pressure, I think. He gave me pills. I take them every day. What was the name… I forget. Little white pills. But I feel okay, mostly. I walk… not fast, but I walk. I eat… normal food. Not too much sugar. My wife… she makes sure of that. Does that… count as a condition?
DOCTOR: “Old knees” and “back not so good” aren't exactly medical conditions, Mr. Carlotta, though we’ll certainly note them. The “high pressure” is more concerning. You said you take pills for it?
PATIENT: Yes, pills. Every morning. Small, white… round ones. I think it’s for… the heart, maybe? The doctor said… something about keeping it calm. I don’t remember the name. It was a long time ago. I go to the doctor… every six months. He checks… everything. I just… forget the details. It’s… old age, you know? Things… slip away. Do you want the name of the doctor? I can write it down, if you need. My wife remembers everything, but she is not here right now.
DOCTOR: It would be very helpful to know the name of the medication, Mr. Carlotta. And the name of your primary care physician. "Keeps the heart calm" is… not a diagnosis. It’s crucial to know what you’re taking and for what reason, especially given your age and this… plan. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can take… most things. I think. My wife always checks… before I take anything new. She is very careful. The doctor… he writes the name on the bottle, yes? I will try to remember. Um… the name of the pill… it starts with an “A,” I think. Amlodipine? Is that right? Or something close to that. And the doctor… Dr. Ramirez. He is… near the market. A small office. I think. Is that enough? I am sorry I cannot remember more. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine. Yes, that’s a calcium channel blocker, used for high blood pressure. And Dr. Ramirez… alright. It appears you've been on Amlodipine for approximately ten years, and Dr. Ramirez last saw you six months ago for a routine check-up. Your blood pressure was… adequately controlled, according to the notes. Now, let’s talk about your wife. How old is she?
PATIENT: Oh, my wife… she is… younger, of course! Much younger. She is… sixty-two. Yes, sixty-two. And very healthy. She walks every day, and she eats very well. She is strong. She looks… much younger than sixty-two, if I may say so. She is the one with the energy. She keeps me going, you see. She hasn't had any… problems, health problems, that is. She goes to the doctor every year, for a check-up. A woman doctor, I think. I forget the name. She is very nice.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two. Alright. While sixty-two is considerably younger than seventy, we still need to assess her health thoroughly. Has she ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. That is… a good question. She has… two children. Grown up now, with families of their own. She had them… a long time ago. When she was… younger, of course. No problems with either pregnancy, she tells me. Normal births. Everything was… good. But that was a long time ago, like thirty years ago. Things change, you see. That is why we are here. To make sure everything is still… okay. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Two previous pregnancies, no complications noted. However, a lot can change in thirty years, as you said. Now, let’s move on to social history. Do you or your wife smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no smoking. Never smoked. My wife… she doesn’t like it. She says it is… bad for the health. We both… try to stay healthy. We drink… sometimes. A little wine with dinner. Maybe two glasses, three if it is a special occasion. But no smoking. Never. We used to… before, a long time ago, but we stopped. A long, long time ago. It's a bad habit, you see. We don’t need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, occasional alcohol consumption. Now, let's talk about allergies. You mentioned you don't have any medication allergies, but do you have any known allergies to food, environmental factors, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of. I eat… everything. Well, almost everything. My wife… she makes me try new things sometimes, but I haven’t had any… reactions. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. I walk outside… in the garden… and I don’t get… itchy or anything. I am lucky, I think. No allergies. A simple life, you see. Just… a little bit old. Is that enough? Are we getting closer to… the answer?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. No known allergies. We’ve covered a fair amount of ground. Now, before we get to “the answer,” I need to conduct a physical exam. This will help me assess your overall health and identify any potential risks. Do you have any specific concerns you'd like me to focus on during the exam?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The exam. Of course. My knees, maybe? They ache sometimes, especially when it is cold. And my back… it is stiff in the morning. But nothing… serious. Just old age, you see. And my heart… just make sure it is still… beating strong. That is all. Just a quick check. Nothing fancy. I trust you, Doctor. You are a very nice lady. Just… be gentle with my knees. They are old. Very old.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… and try not to talk while I’m taking your reading. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Please extend your legs… There’s some crepitus and limited range of motion in both knees, consistent with osteoarthritis. You’ve got some swelling as well. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are diminished, but present. Alright. Overall, your physical exam reveals some expected findings for someone your age. However, the elevated blood pressure and osteoarthritis are areas we need to monitor. It is important to note that embarking on a pregnancy at your age carries significant risks to both you and your wife. We will need to consider those risks very carefully.
PATIENT: Risks… yes. I understand. My wife… she is strong. She can handle things. But I… I want to be sure. Is it… possible? Even with the risks? Is there… anything we can do to make it safer? Pills, maybe? Or… special care? I am willing to do… whatever it takes. Just to… try. Is there a chance? A small chance? Even a very small one? It would mean… everything to us.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your desire, and I commend you and your wife for being proactive. However, I need to be very frank with you. The chances of a successful pregnancy at your age are extremely low – less than 1%. And even if conception were to occur, the risks of complications are substantial. These include, but are not limited to: gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placental abruption, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, and chromosomal abnormalities in the baby. Pills alone will not eliminate these risks. However, there are some things we can do to minimize them. These include: a thorough medical evaluation of both you and your wife, optimization of any existing medical conditions, genetic counseling and testing, and very close monitoring throughout the pregnancy, should it occur. But even with all of these precautions, the risks remain significant. Before we proceed any further, I strongly recommend that you and your wife discuss these risks in detail and carefully consider whether you are prepared to accept them. I would also recommend a consultation with a high-risk obstetrician, who can provide a more comprehensive assessment and guidance. Would you like me to schedule a referral for you?
PATIENT: A referral… yes. Please. My wife… she will want to hear this from someone… someone who knows. She is very practical. She will ask all the questions. I… I just want to be prepared. To understand. It is… a lot to take in. A small chance. Significant risks. But… maybe, just maybe… it is worth trying. If we can be careful. If we can be prepared. Thank you, Doctor. For being honest. And for being kind. Please… schedule the referral. And… tell me, is there anything I should be doing now? To… prepare my body? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. I'll schedule a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a high-risk obstetrician at City General Hospital. She is excellent. I will also send her your medical records. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do. First, focus on optimizing your overall health. Continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Maintain a healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Engage in regular, low-impact exercise, such as walking. And most importantly, manage your stress levels. Stress can exacerbate existing medical conditions and increase the risk of complications. I also recommend that you and your wife discontinue any alcohol consumption and refrain from smoking. It’s also important to remember that this is a team effort. Open communication between you, your wife, and the medical team is crucial. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. I've scheduled the referral with Dr. Reed. You should receive a call within the next few days to arrange an appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you and your wife all the best. .
