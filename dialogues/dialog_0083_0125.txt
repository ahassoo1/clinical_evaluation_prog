DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, good to meet you too. Look, I just… wanted to get tested for HIV. I figured it's better to just know, you know? No drama, just… checking things. It’s not like there’s a reason, specifically. Just being sensible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Belan. That’s very responsible of you to prioritize your health and get tested. It's always best to be proactive. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about any potential risk factors you might have, even if you don't think they're significant?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Honestly, Doctor, I find that question a bit… presumptuous. I'm married. Have been for ten years. And a pretty boring one at that. So, no. Nothing like that. I mean, are you suggesting…? It’s just a standard check-up, right? I don’t need to list every time I’ve shaken someone’s hand.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question came across as presumptuous, Mr. Belan. That was not my intention at all. I assure you, it's simply standard procedure to gather a comprehensive medical history to ensure the most accurate testing and provide appropriate care. It’s important to consider all possibilities, however unlikely they may seem. When I ask about risk factors, I'm thinking about things like unprotected sexual contact with someone whose HIV status is unknown, sharing needles, or a history of certain medical procedures. It's not about making assumptions, but about gathering information that helps us interpret the test results correctly. Regardless, we can certainly proceed with the testing as you requested. Would you mind if I ask a few questions about your overall health history before we move forward?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I’m a Compliance Officer. I deal with protocols all day. I understand “due diligence.” But frankly, this feels… excessive. I’m happily married, I don’t do anything risky, and I assure you, my wife and I are… careful. Asking me about “unprotected sexual contact” feels a bit intrusive, don’t you think? Just get on with the test, please. I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan, and I apologize again if my questions have felt intrusive. You are correct to hold me to a standard of professional and respectful care. Very well. We can proceed with the HIV test without further discussion of your risk factors. However, I do want to inform you that a negative test result is most reliable when considered alongside a thorough risk assessment. If you change your mind and would like to discuss this further at any point, please don’t hesitate to let me know. To proceed, we'll need to draw a sample of your blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulty with blood draws?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no, I’m fine with needles. Honestly, Doctor, it's just a little prick. I deal with far more complicated things at work. Just… get it over with, alright? The quicker this is done, the better. I don't like wasting time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I understand. If you'll follow me, the phlebotomist is ready for you. It will only take a few minutes. Once the sample is drawn, it will be sent to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few business days. I’ll have the results sent to your insurance, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Do you have any questions before we go?
PATIENT: No. Let’s just… get it done. My insurance is Medicare, by the way. Make sure everything goes through correctly. I’ve had issues with paperwork before, it’s a nightmare. Lead the way, Doctor. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I will make a note to ensure all the paperwork is handled correctly with Medicare. We have a dedicated billing department that handles these things efficiently, so I’m confident there won’t be any issues. “Good morning, Sarah. This is Mr. Belan. He’s here for an HIV test. Please let me know if you need anything.” Sarah will take excellent care of you. She’ll explain the process. I’ll be just down the hall if you need me.
PATIENT: Right. Well, hopefully this is quick. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. Too many germs. Tell your… Sarah… to be gentle, alright? And make sure the needle is new. You can't be too careful these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Belan. I will personally ensure that Sarah uses a brand new, sterile needle and that she’s as gentle as possible. We take infection control very seriously here. I'll just step outside to give you both some privacy.
