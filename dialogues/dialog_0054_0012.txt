DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one around the Mediterranean, actually – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They asked for a doctor’s note, just to say I’m fit enough to travel. That’s all, really. Nothing complicated, I hope.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Squiers. A travel clearance is quite common. So, just to be thorough, even though you feel well, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history. It helps me get a complete picture. First, have you been seeing any doctors regularly, or do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, my general health is quite good, I believe. I lost my husband, Robert, two years ago, and his doctor was very good, Dr. MacIntyre. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor much since then, to be honest. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years back – just stiffness, really, nothing serious – but that cleared up with some physiotherapy. I wouldn't say I have any ongoing conditions, no. Just the usual aches and pains for a woman of my age, I suppose!
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to hear you've been generally well. And it's perfectly normal to have some aches and pains. Just to clarify, when you say the back stiffness cleared up, is it completely gone now, or do you still experience any discomfort occasionally?
PATIENT: It's mostly gone, Doctor. I wouldn’t say completely, but it’s nothing that bothers me day-to-day. If I've been gardening, perhaps, or lifting something a bit heavy, I might feel a twinge. But it’s easily managed with a warm bath and a good rest. It doesn’t stop me from doing anything I want, thankfully. It’s not a constant pain, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I haven't had any surgeries. Not a single one, thankfully. I’ve been quite lucky in that regard, really. Just the usual childhood things – tonsils out when I was a wee girl, but that was a very long time ago. Nothing since then, no.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about any significant illnesses or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had a rather nasty bout of flu a few years back, that kept me in bed for a week or so. But no hospital stays, no. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was a teenager – clumsy girl, I was! – but that didn’t require a hospital stay either. Just a cast from the local doctor. Nothing serious at all, truly. I’ve been very fortunate in avoiding anything major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Squiers. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a bit of a mixed bag, I’m afraid. My mother lived to a good age – eighty-nine, she did – but she suffered from arthritis in her later years. My father had high blood pressure, I believe. And my brother, well, he has some sort of heart condition, but I don’t know the specifics, and we don't speak often, so I'm not entirely sure. It's not anything I've ever worried about particularly, if I’m honest. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. It gives me a bit of a picture. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not taking anything at all. I prefer to avoid medication if I can, to be honest. A good diet and plenty of fresh air, that’s my motto! I might take a paracetamol if I have a headache, but that’s it. No regular prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing like that. Just the occasional painkiller when needed, but very rarely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve always been very lucky in that regard. No allergies at all, as far as I know. I can eat anything and everything – although I don't particularly like Brussels sprouts, but that's not an allergy! No reactions to any medications either. I’ve never had any trouble with that. A very straightforward case, I believe.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Squiers. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Robert smoked for a while, bless him, but I always told him to do it outside, and I never picked up the habit myself. I always thought it was a dreadful thing. So, no, no smoking at all. And I don’t drink much either, just a glass of wine with my dinner occasionally. That’s it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say “regularly” in the strictest sense, Doctor. I do a bit of gardening, which keeps me active, and I enjoy a good walk. I try to walk the dog every day, weather permitting, of course. And I used to go swimming quite a bit, but I haven’t been in a while, to be honest. I'm not one for strenuous exercise, but I try to keep myself moving. It's important, you know, to stay active.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It sounds like you're very active for someone who doesn't consider themselves to be “exercising.” Just one more question regarding your lifestyle, Ms. Squiers. Are you employed, or retired?
PATIENT: I'm retired now, Doctor. I used to be a merchandise displayer – window trimming, you know? Lovely work, it was, very creative. But I took early retirement a few years ago. Gives me plenty of time for gardening and walks and planning cruises! It’s a good life, a good life. And keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Well, that gives me a good overview of your medical history, Ms. Squiers. Everything sounds quite good. Now, I'd just like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and have a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I haven't had a proper check-up in a while, so it will be good to get everything looked at. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just hop up on the table for me, that would be lovely. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here we are. Do tell me if it's cold! I do feel the chill these days, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be cold at all. Just breathe normally for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good breath sounds throughout. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80 – that’s within the normal range. Ears are clear. Throat looks clear as well. Everything seems to be in good order, Ms. Squiers. No obvious concerns.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I was a little worried, to be honest, but that puts my mind at ease. I am glad you checked everything so thoroughly. So, does that mean I'm fit enough to go on my cruise? That’s all I really wanted to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Squiers. Based on everything we’ve discussed and my examination, I have no medical concerns that would prevent you from enjoying your cruise. You appear to be in good health and fit to travel. I’ll write you a brief note confirming this, just for the cruise line’s records. It will state that you are in good general health and have no contraindications to travel. Do you have any specific concerns you'd like me to include in the note?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news! Thank you so much, Doctor. No, I don't think so. Just the usual, really – fit for travel, no restrictions. A simple note will be perfect. I'm so relieved. Perhaps just mention I have no allergies, just in case? That might be helpful. Thank you again, you’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. It confirms you are in good general health, have no known allergies, and are fit for travel. It also includes my contact information should the cruise line require any further clarification. Do you have any questions for me before we finish, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect, that’s exactly what I needed. Thank you so much. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and have put my mind completely at ease. I appreciate your time and kindness. I suppose that’s everything. I’m very much looking forward to my cruise now! Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise immensely! Have a wonderful time, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns when you return. Safe travels!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I certainly will. Goodbye, and thank you again for everything.
