DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it's the only thing that really helps. Frankly, I think it's a bit much, but I figured I'd humor her and see if you think I qualify for one of those… certifications. I don’t want to become one of those people, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, medical marijuana… for arthritis. Hmm. Okay. And how long have you been experiencing arthritis symptoms, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years. Decades, really. It comes and goes, you know? Mostly in my hands and knees. It's not… crippling, exactly. Just… bothersome. More bothersome in the winter, of course. Dampness always gets to it. I’ve been managing with creams and over-the-counter things. And a good dose of willpower, naturally.
DOCTOR: Willpower is good. And you said creams and over-the-counter medications… can you tell me what specifically you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… there was that one with the menthol. Very cooling, but didn't do much in the long run. And ibuprofen, naturally. All those pills aren't good for you, though, are they? I try not to take too many. My daughter keeps suggesting all sorts of things… creams with… capsaicin, I think it was called? It smelled dreadful. Honestly, Doctor, it's a bit of a mess trying to keep track of it all. I mostly just… deal with it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve tried a few things over the years. Just to clarify, when you say "deal with it," can you describe a typical day?
PATIENT: Well. I get up, naturally. And it’s always a little stiff, you understand? Especially if it's been damp. Then I have my tea. And I try to do my little exercises. Very gentle, don’t want to overdo it. I do a bit of gardening, mostly weeding, bending is… troublesome. Then lunch. And in the afternoon, I might do a little sewing, if my hands aren't bothering me too much. It's not… a life of hardship, Doctor. Just… inconvenient. I wouldn't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Okay. And on a scale of one to ten, with one being no pain at all and ten being the worst pain you've ever experienced, what would you say your pain level is on average during the day?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, ten is… dramatic, isn't it? I’ve had a few real pains in my life, you understand. Childbirth, a broken wrist… so, definitely not a ten. Maybe… a three? Four, on a bad day? It's rarely debilitating, but it's always there, a little ache, a little stiffness. It just… wears you down, you know? It's the constantness of it, not the severity.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. And have you seen a rheumatologist for your arthritis at any point?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist? Goodness, no. All those specialists… I don’t go running to doctors for every little ache and pain. My mother always said doctors just like to poke and prod and give you things that are worse than what ails you. I’ve managed perfectly well on my own for all these years. A little cream, a little willpower, and a good cup of tea. That’s all one needs, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. Well, just to get a fuller picture, could you briefly describe your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had the flu, naturally, a few times. Pneumonia, years ago, when I was younger. Nothing serious. My blood pressure is a little high, but the doctor says it's just age. And my knees… I had a little cartilage tear in one of them, years ago, but it healed on its own. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy woman for my age. I don't go around complaining about every little thing. It's just this arthritis, and my daughter… well, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I’ve never had a surgery in my life. I don’t believe in them. Too much risk, you understand? All that poking around… I prefer to let nature take its course. And a little cream, naturally. I've always been very careful about my health. I eat a sensible diet, I get plenty of rest… well, as much rest as one can with a worrying daughter.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, regularly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a little vitamin D in the winter. The doctor suggested it. And sometimes, if my blood pressure is a little high, I take one of those little pills… hydrochlorothiazide, I think it is called. Just when it gets a bit high, though. Not every day. And… oh, yes, I take a little ibuprofen sometimes for the arthritis, when it really bothers me. But I try not to, you understand? Not good for the stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve never been one for allergies. A little bit of a sniffle in the spring sometimes, but that's just the pollen, you understand? Nothing serious. I'm a very strong woman. I don't get sick easily. And I certainly don't go around reacting to every little thing. My mother always said fresh air and a good diet is the best medicine, and I've always lived by that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ms. Ranells, I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me. To clarify, your primary concern is exploring medical marijuana as a potential treatment for your arthritis, given your daughter's recommendation. You’ve been managing with creams, ibuprofen occasionally, and vitamin D, and you’ve not seen a rheumatologist or had any surgeries. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly correct. You understand perfectly. I just want to explore all my options. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s very insistent. And frankly, I’m willing to try… if it means I can avoid taking all those pills. But I still don't know if I qualify for one of those… certifications. What exactly does that even involve? And will I… will I look like one of those people? I do have a reputation to uphold, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Ranells. It's perfectly reasonable to want to be informed and comfortable with any potential treatment, and especially to consider the social implications. The certification process involves a review of your medical history—which we’ve started today—and an assessment of whether medical marijuana might be appropriate for your condition, based on the state guidelines. We would need to confirm that your arthritis is a qualifying condition, and that other more conventional treatments have not been sufficient. As for looking like "those people," that's entirely up to you. There are many ways to use medical marijuana, and it doesn't necessarily involve any visible changes. Now, to proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to assess the range of motion and tenderness in your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well, I suppose so. I don't like being poked and prodded, you understand. But if it’s necessary… alright. Just be gentle, Doctor. And don’t keep me waiting too long. I have a luncheon appointment later, and my daughter would be very upset if I was late. She’s the one who insisted on this whole thing, after all. Now, where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ranells. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s have you sit comfortably here. Now, can you please bend your knees, one at a time, towards your chest?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is always a little difficult. My knees aren't what they used to be, you understand. There. Is that enough? I don’t want to overdo it. It's not a comfortable position, Doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see a slight limitation in both knees with some discomfort during flexion. Now, can you rotate your wrists and ankles, both directions, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a little stiff, you understand? My hands get so achy sometimes. There. That’s about as much as I can do without too much discomfort, Doctor. It's not easy, you know? I do a lot of sewing, and that doesn’t help. The fine movements… they just aggravate it.
DOCTOR: I see some mild tenderness in both wrists and ankles, particularly on the radial side. And no significant swelling. Now, if you don't mind, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are two plus bilaterally, which is normal. And finally, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, Ms. Ranells. That concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t so bad. I still don’t know what all that means, you understand. Do I have arthritis or don't I? And what about this… certification? Am I a good candidate? I don't want to be taking something that's going to make me feel… strange. Or affect my luncheon appointments. You understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you do have symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis, particularly in your knees, wrists, and ankles. The exam didn’t show significant inflammation, which is common in osteoarthritis. As for the certification, based on the state guidelines, you would likely qualify for medical marijuana for symptomatic relief of your osteoarthritis. However, it's important to understand that it’s not a cure, and the effectiveness can vary from person to person. And you are right to be concerned about potential side effects. Common side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth. We would start with a very low dose and carefully monitor your response. It’s also crucial to discuss any potential interactions with your current medications—specifically the hydrochlorothiazide. And yes, it could affect your alertness, so it’s important to be cautious when driving or operating machinery. We can also discuss alternative treatment options—like physical therapy or other pain management strategies—and determine if medical marijuana is the right fit for you. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It sounds complicated, Doctor. And all those side effects… drowsiness? Dizziness? Absolutely not. I have a reputation to uphold, you understand. And the hydrochlorothiazide… I barely remember taking it as it is. So, it sounds like a lot of trouble for… what exactly? A little bit of relief? Is it worth all the hassle? My daughter would be thrilled, of course. But I'm not sure I am. Perhaps… perhaps physical therapy would be better. Less risk, less fuss. What does that involve, exactly? And will it hurt? I do have a low tolerance for pain, you understand.
DOCTOR: You are right to be cautious and weigh your options carefully, Ms. Ranells. Physical therapy is a very reasonable alternative. It involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve range of motion, and reduce pain. It can be very effective in managing osteoarthritis symptoms, and it doesn’t carry the same risks as medication. As for pain, it’s possible you’ll experience some mild discomfort initially, as your muscles are worked. However, a good physical therapist will tailor the exercises to your tolerance level and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. They will also use techniques like heat, ice, and massage to help relieve pain. It typically involves several sessions over a period of weeks or months. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a reputable physical therapy clinic in the area?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. A referral to a good physical therapy clinic, please. Something close by, preferably. And someone… gentle. I don’t want anyone pushing me too hard, you understand. And perhaps… perhaps we can forget about this marijuana for now. It sounds like too much trouble. My daughter will be disappointed, of course. But she'll understand. I think. Now, where do we sign the papers? And will this referral cost me anything? I'm on a fixed income, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ranells. I completely understand. I will print out a referral to a highly-rated clinic nearby with a reputation for gentle, patient-centered care. There is no cost to you for the referral itself. The cost of the physical therapy sessions will depend on the clinic’s fees and your insurance coverage. Since you are uninsured, they may offer a sliding fee scale or payment plan. I’ll also provide you with a contact number so you can discuss the costs before scheduling an appointment. Here is the referral. It includes the clinic’s address, phone number, and a brief description of their services. I’ll also have my assistant provide you with a summary of our conversation today, including the physical exam findings and the plan for physical therapy. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time. And for being so… understanding. I do appreciate it. I still don’t know much about this arthritis, but at least I have a plan now. Perhaps physical therapy will do the trick. I do hope so. And thank you again. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon appointment to get to. And my daughter would be very upset if I was late.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Ranells. It was my pleasure. I wish you all the best with the physical therapy, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Enjoy your luncheon!
