DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my heart, it feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but it happens. It’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, “flapping,” I understand. That’s a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: When? Hmm… not when I’m doing something hard. It’s… when I’m just sitting, maybe. Or before I sleep. Sometimes when I wake up. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. But it feels… strange. Like it’s beating too fast, but… not right.
DOCTOR: I see. So it tends to happen at rest or when you're relaxing, and it doesn’t seem to be related to exertion. And you said just a few seconds, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, a few seconds. Maybe ten, fifteen seconds. Not more. And no, not when I work. I work with… machines, big machines. Lots of walking, sometimes heavy things. Never happens then. Only when I’m quiet.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes, even if it's not exertion?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like… what makes it happen? I don’t think so. Maybe… if I drink coffee too much? But I don’t drink much coffee. And sometimes it happens even if I don’t drink any. I don’t know. It just… starts. It’s hard to say what makes it happen.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it doesn't seem consistently linked to coffee intake. Have you ever felt any other symptoms with this fluttering?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… other things feel wrong? Sometimes… I feel a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And maybe a little… out of breath. But it goes away when the heart stops flapping. Not always, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and sometimes feeling short of breath with the palpitations. Have you ever experienced chest pain, lightheadedness, or any sweating when this happens?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not pain. Never pain. Lightheadedness… maybe a little, like the dizzy. Sweating? No, not sweating. Just… the heart feeling funny, and maybe a little dizzy, and sometimes hard to breathe. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been happening for a long time, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: Hmm… not long, I think. Maybe… two months? Three months? It started… after a very hot day. We were working outside, very hot. It hasn’t happened every day, but it happens… enough that I wanted to check it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started approximately two to three months ago, following a particularly hot day of work. That’s useful information. Now, let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any known medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No… nothing. I never been sick much. I work hard, eat okay. No… I don’t have any… conditions. Never told I have any.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that’s it. Just the arm.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Um… my father, he had… problems with his heart when he was old. But he lived a long life, very long. My mother, she was healthy. My brothers, they are okay, I think. No heart problems that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had some heart issues later in life, but your mother was healthy and your brothers are currently well. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. Never smoked. I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Maybe one or two beers… on the weekend. Not every weekend. Not much. I don’t drink a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption, not excessive. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t take anything. Just… water. And food, of course. I don’t like taking pills if I don't need them.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s all very helpful information, Mr. Puder. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It shouldn’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My heart… it's okay if you listen.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, if you could please lie back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 72 and regular. I do hear a slight irregularity in your heart rhythm when I listen carefully, a few extra beats that aren't quite right. It’s not a strong irregularity, but it’s something we should investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. I'm also going to feel your pulse in a few different places to get a better sense of the rhythm. Pulses are good and strong. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard, I’d like to order an EKG, which is a simple test that records your heart's electrical activity. This will help me understand what’s causing the irregularity. I also think it would be a good idea to do some blood work to check your electrolytes and thyroid levels, as these can sometimes cause palpitations. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… EKG… blood work… I don’t know much about those things. But… if you think it’s important, then yes. Do whatever you think is best. My heart is just… sometimes funny. I want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you want to get to the bottom of this. The EKG and blood work are just routine tests to help us figure out what's going on. They shouldn’t take long, and we can get the results pretty quickly. Okay, I'm ordering an EKG and a basic metabolic panel, which includes electrolytes, kidney function, and glucose. I’ll also add a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will explain everything to you. While we're waiting for the results, it's important to avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol. Also, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness that is severe or doesn't go away, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And… is it something serious? I worry a little. My father… he was sick at the end.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Puder, especially given your father’s health. It's good that you're expressing your concerns. We typically get the results back from the lab within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them and we can discuss them together. As for whether it’s serious… it’s too early to say definitively. The irregularity I heard could be something harmless, like a skipped beat, or it could be a sign of something more significant. That's why we're doing the tests – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll take it one step at a time. We're doing this to rule things out and ensure your heart is healthy. For now, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you. You are very kind. I feel… better now, just knowing you are looking into it. I will wait for the phone call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. If you experience any worsening symptoms or new concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a copy of the lab order for your records. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
