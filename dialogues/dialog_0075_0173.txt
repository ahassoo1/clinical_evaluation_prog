DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Panjoj, good morning! Well, I've just been getting the chills lately, and it's kind of bothering me. It's not like a fever chill, just… cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills. And you say it's not accompanied by a fever, just a general feeling of being cold?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. No fever, no sweats, nothing like that. Just…brrr. It happens on and off, mostly in the evenings I think, but sometimes during the day too. It’s weird because it's pretty warm out, right? It doesn't really make sense.
DOCTOR: Right, that is unusual, especially with the current weather. And when did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe about a week ago? It started gradually, just feeling a little cooler than usual, and then it became more noticeable, like proper chills. I didn’t really pay much attention at first, thought it was just me being tired, but it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week. And are you experiencing anything else along with the chills?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I've been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? And maybe a tiny bit achy, but I work on my feet a lot for my job, so I often feel a bit sore. Nothing major, definitely not like the flu. It’s really just the chills that are worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… No cough, no sore throat, no runny nose… Stomach’s fine, no issues there. I haven't lost my appetite or anything. I guess… no. Nothing else comes to mind. Honestly, it's just the chills, and they're just… annoying. Do you think it could be something serious? I'm a bit of a worrier, sorry!
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jailenne. It's good you’re paying attention to your body. Let’s do a quick examination to get a better idea of what might be going on. Could you please step onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m a bit sensitive to the cold, if that helps!
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. Lungs are clear – no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’ll check your temperature. Temperature is 36.8 degrees Celsius, which is normal. I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes now. No swelling detected. Finally, let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems physically normal so far.
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to hear, I guess! It's just… frustrating. So, what could it be if everything seems okay? Could it be stress? I’ve been a little stressed with work lately. Or maybe something I’m eating? I try to eat healthy, but you never know.
DOCTOR: Stress is certainly a possibility, as is a mild viral infection that isn't presenting with typical symptoms. However, we need to rule out a few other things. Have you noticed any changes in your skin recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, it's summer, so I’ve gotten a little more sun, but no rashes or anything like that. Just a bit of a tan, I think. And I haven't changed my skincare routine or anything. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been a bit more itchy lately, all over. But I just thought it was the heat. It’s really mild, not constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild itching could be relevant. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, fruit, lean protein… I do drink a fair bit of coffee, though. Maybe two or three cups a day. And I had a really rich chocolate cake last week for a friend’s birthday… could that be it? It was delicious, but maybe it threw something off? I’m grasping at straws here, I know!
DOCTOR: It’s good to consider everything. A high caffeine intake or a sudden indulgence could contribute, but let’s also rule out other possibilities. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. I can eat shellfish, nuts, all the usual things people are allergic to. I've tried a few new foods lately, nothing major, just different fruits and vegetables, but nothing triggered anything. I think my mom has a slight dust allergy, but that's it. I really don't think it's allergies though. It just feels… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and the lack of any obvious cause, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The CBC will help us rule out infection or other blood disorders, and the TSH test will check your thyroid function, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause chills and fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Panjoj. A blood test seems sensible. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Where do I go to get that done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll send the order electronically to the lab across the street—they're at 123 Main Street. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. Once they're back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, get enough rest, and perhaps reduce your caffeine intake a little. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds manageable. Hydrate, rest, less coffee… I can do that. Thank you, Dr. Panjoj. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I feel a bit better just knowing we’re looking into it. I'll head over to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
