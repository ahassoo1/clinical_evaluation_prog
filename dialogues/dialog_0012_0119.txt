DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It’s… a rather delicate matter, truthfully. It’s about… a discharge. A penile discharge, as the paperwork states. It’s rather embarrassing, you understand. I haven’t… well, it’s not something one discusses lightly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie. It is a sensitive topic, and you’re doing the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. It takes courage to talk about things like this, and I want to assure you this is a safe space and I'm here to help without any judgment. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Courage had little to do with it, Doctor. It's simply… inconvenient. And frankly, worrying. It started… oh, perhaps a week ago? It’s not a large amount, mind you. More of a… a spotting, really. And it’s… yellowish. Though sometimes it appears… cloudy. I do try to maintain a certain level of… cleanliness, but it’s rather distressing, nonetheless. I haven't been… with anyone, if that’s what you’re implying. I certainly wouldn't allow that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Jinnie. It’s helpful to know it started about a week ago, and that you haven't had any recent sexual contact. That information certainly narrows things down. You mentioned it’s yellowish and sometimes cloudy. Is there any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes. A slight one. It’s not… foul, exactly. More… fishy. Though I assure you, Doctor, I’ve been taking regular baths. It’s just… a subtle unpleasantness. I thought perhaps it was my soap, but I’ve tried several different brands now, and it persists. It’s most noticeable after… exertion, I suppose. Or after a long day. Honestly, it's quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fishy odor, especially after exertion, is good to know. It sounds like we should rule out a few possibilities. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… well, there’s a slight… burning sensation when I urinate. Not terribly painful, mind you, but noticeable. And I've felt a bit more… fatigued than usual. Though, at my age, one always feels fatigued, doesn't one? I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating, but I do find myself needing a nap in the afternoon, which is unusual for me. And… my trousers have felt a bit tighter lately. Though that could simply be the heat, of course. It is August.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a slight burning with urination, increased fatigue, and feeling a bit tighter in your trousers – we'll definitely look into all of that. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any swelling or redness anywhere, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Swelling? No, no swelling at all. I would have noticed that, Doctor. I am rather particular about my appearance, you see. And redness… well, perhaps a slight discoloration, but I attributed that to the heat rash I sometimes get in the summer. As for pain… no, not exactly pain. More of a… discomfort. A dull ache, occasionally, in my lower abdomen. But nothing severe. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all rather… upsetting. I haven’t felt this… off in years. I pride myself on maintaining a certain… composure.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need to check your abdomen, and then I’d also like to take a small sample of the discharge to send to the lab for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A physical exam. Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must say, Doctor, I do hope it will be… discreet. I am not accustomed to such… procedures. And a sample, you say? How… precisely… will that be collected? I hope it won’t be too… unpleasant. I assure you, I am a woman of delicate sensibilities. And please, Doctor, ensure everything is… sterile. I wouldn't want to contract anything. This is already quite distressing enough.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. Discretion is my utmost priority, and I understand your concerns completely. We will make sure everything is as comfortable and dignified as possible. For the sample collection, we'll use a sterile swab. I'll provide you with instructions, and it's a relatively quick and simple process. I’ll step out of the room to give you privacy, and I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all. We'll use gloves and sterile equipment, and I’ll walk you through everything. First, let's start with the abdominal exam. Do you have any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: Well, very well. Lead on, Doctor. Though I must reiterate, I do expect a certain… gentleness. And please, explain what you are doing at each step. I dislike being kept in the dark, you understand. As for pain… yes, a slight tenderness here, on the left side. Not sharp, mind you, but… noticeable. It's been rather nagging lately. And perhaps a bit of discomfort here, towards the lower abdomen. Though, as I said, it could simply be gas. I do try to watch my diet, but one can’t always avoid certain… indulgences, can one?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. I’m starting on the right side… any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort there, Doctor. Perfectly normal. Though, you are pressing rather firmly. Perhaps a bit less pressure? I am not made of stone, you know. And honestly, this is rather unnerving. I haven't been examined like this in… well, decades. Though, I suppose it’s necessary, as you say. Just… please be gentle. And do explain what you are looking for. I like to understand things, you see. It’s a matter of principle.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, and I apologize if I was too firm. I'm checking for any areas of tenderness, masses, or enlargement of organs. It helps me get a sense of what might be going on. Okay, now I'm moving to the left side… any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Hmph. Slightly uncomfortable, yes. A dull ache, really. Right about… here. . It’s not excruciating, mind you, but it’s definitely there. It’s been rather persistent lately, I must say. It comes and goes, but it’s always lurking in the background. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to feel quite anxious. This is all rather… unsettling. Is it something serious? You’re not going to tell me it’s… something dreadful, are you? I pride myself on maintaining a certain… robustness, you see. I simply cannot abide illness.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Jinnie, and I want to reassure you that we are just gathering information at this point. It’s good that you’re letting me know about this tenderness. It’s too early to say what’s causing it, but we’ll get to the bottom of it. Okay, now I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will just help me check for any unusual sounds. Just breathe normally. The sounds are within normal limits. Now, for the sample collection, if you’re comfortable. I can explain the procedure in detail again, and we can take things at your pace. I have a private restroom right down the hall, and I’ll provide everything you need.
PATIENT: Well, very well. I suppose it must be done. But do be quick about it, Doctor. And please, explain everything again, very carefully. I do not want any… surprises. And ensure it is all… sterile, as I said before. I am a woman of delicate sensibilities, you understand. And honestly, this is all rather… humiliating. I haven’t been subjected to such indignities in… well, decades. And I expect complete discretion, of course. This conversation must remain strictly confidential. I have a reputation to uphold, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. Your comfort and dignity are my top priorities. We’ll take things at your pace, and I’ll explain everything step-by-step. And I assure you, everything will be strictly confidential. Here’s what we’ll do. I’ll give you a sterile swab – it looks like a small cotton bud. I’ll also give you a sterile container. You’ll gently use the swab to collect a small sample of the discharge – just a tiny amount is needed. Then, you’ll place the swab into the container. It’s important to avoid any contact with the swab itself – just use it to collect the sample. I’ll step out so you have complete privacy, and I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all. There's a call button if you need me to come back in. Do you have any questions before you go in?
PATIENT: A call button, you say? Good. That is reassuring. And you are certain a tiny amount is sufficient? I do not wish to… overdo it. And what if I… cannot collect anything? Is that possible? Honestly, this is all rather… awkward. And what happens with the sample afterwards? Do you… examine it under a microscope? I do hope it’s not too… graphic. Honestly, Doctor, I am beginning to regret this entire endeavor. This is simply not how I envisioned my afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to feel anxious, Jinnie. A tiny amount is sufficient – we don’t need a large sample. If you have trouble collecting anything, don’t worry – just do your best, and we can discuss it. And yes, the sample will be examined under a microscope by a lab technician. They’re looking for bacteria or other signs of infection. It’s a standard procedure, and they’re professionals – it’s not graphic at all. They’re simply looking for clues to help us understand what’s going on. I’ll give you a moment to collect yourself, and I'll be right outside if you need anything at all. Here’s the swab and the container. Take your time, and remember, your comfort and dignity are my top priorities. I'll be just outside the door.
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all… A microscope! Robustness, indeed. .
