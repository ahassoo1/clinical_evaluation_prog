DOCTOR: Right. Lilliana Voner, 52. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. It’s… my joints, I think. They get really stiff in the mornings. It’s just… hard to move when I first wake up. It’s been going on for a little while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Fuzzy. Yes. Well, “a little while” isn’t terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, dear. Sorry. I wish I could be more… specific. It feels like maybe… six months? Or longer? It’s hard to say. My husband… he always remembered everything. It’s different now. Everything just sort of… blends together. It’s mostly my knees and hands, I think. They ache and… well, they’re just stiff. It takes a long time to get going in the morning.
DOCTOR: Six months. Fine. And is this stiffness… constant throughout the day, or does it improve?
PATIENT: It gets better, yes. After I move around for a bit, it loosens up. It’s worst when I’m just sitting or… lying in bed, you know? Like, when I first get up, it’s really bad. Then, after I’ve been up and about with the little ones for a while… it’s not gone, but it’s… manageable. I can still do everything, I just… feel it. It doesn't stop me, really.
DOCTOR: "Manageable". And do you have any swelling in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Sometimes they feel a little… puffy, maybe? But not like… big and swollen, no. It's hard to tell, you know? They’re… well, I’m a bigger woman, if you know what I mean. It’s hard to tell what’s normal puffiness and what’s… not.
DOCTOR: Right. And any redness?
PATIENT: Redness? No, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My skin gets a little… warm sometimes, but that’s probably just from being on my feet all day with the children. It doesn’t feel hot, if that makes sense. Just… normal skin, really. I haven’t seen any red patches or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Do you have any family history of… arthritis, or any similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… My mother… she had some aches and pains when she got older, but I don’t know what kind. She just always complained about her knees, I think. And my grandmother… she had some trouble walking when she was very old, but I don't know if that was her joints or something else. I don’t really know much about their medical history, honestly. They didn’t really talk about those things back then. Sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not really. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, when it gets really bad. Like, ibuprofen or something. But not regularly. I try to avoid taking too many pills. They never seem to help much, anyway. It’s just a little bit of relief, if anything. Mostly, I just try to push through it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look at your joints. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here we go… Just let me know if I need help getting up again. My knees aren't what they used to be. Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Knees show some tenderness to palpation, but no significant swelling or warmth. Range of motion is slightly limited but within normal limits. Hands… a little tenderness at the base of the thumbs. Do you experience any pain in your wrists?
PATIENT: Wrists… hmm. Sometimes, yes. Not all the time, but when I’m lifting the little ones, or… gardening, sometimes they ache. It's not a sharp pain, just a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. I never really thought much about it, to be honest. It just feels like… part of getting older. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, it sounds like you likely have early-stage osteoarthritis. It's common, especially with age and some family history. We'll need some X-rays to confirm, but that’s what I suspect. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is that… is that why I’m stiff in the mornings? And why my hands ache? Will it get worse? I'm sorry, I don't think I really understand. Is it something I caught? Will I need… medicine? I don’t want to take a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not something you “catch”. It’s wear and tear on the joints over time. It can cause stiffness, pain, and limited range of motion. It can worsen over time, yes, but it’s manageable. We'll start with X-rays of your hands and knees to confirm the diagnosis. Then, we can discuss some options. We can try physical therapy, which can help strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. We can also discuss over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, but we’ll start with the lowest possible dose. If those aren’t enough, we can consider other options, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot to take in. Physical therapy… that sounds good, I suppose. I don’t mind a bit of exercise, if it helps. And I suppose I could try those… ibuprofen things. But what if they don't work? And… will I be able to still do everything? I take care of little ones, you know. I need to be able to lift them and play with them. I don’t want to be… limited. And… how long will the X-rays take? I don't have anyone to watch the children for very long.
DOCTOR: The X-rays will take about fifteen minutes. As for being limited… it depends on how the condition progresses. We’ll do our best to manage it and prevent that. Physical therapy is key, and we can adjust the plan as needed. We're going to order the X-rays first. Then, we'll get you a referral to a physical therapist. Let's focus on getting the X-rays done first, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Fifteen minutes… that should be okay. Okay. X-rays first. Where do I go? And… will someone tell me the results? I don’t really understand all the medical… talk. Is it far? I should probably call the daycare to let them know I'll be a bit late.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. The technician will take the images and a radiologist will review them. The results will be sent to me, and I will discuss them with you at a follow-up appointment. I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you before you leave. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Down the hall. And they’ll send the results to you? So I don't need to worry about that. No, I don’t think so. Just… the follow-up appointment. Yes. Thank you, doctor. I suppose I’ll just… go down the hall then.
DOCTOR: Yes. Go ahead. And try not to strain yourself. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you. .
