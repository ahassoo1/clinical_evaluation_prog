DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Hello Doctor. It's... my throat. It hurts. Bad. I don't have much time, if you don't mind. Just... fix it, please. It started a few days ago, I think. Maybe longer. It's hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time and your throat is bothering you. We'll try to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can. “A few days ago, maybe longer…” That's alright, we’ll figure it out. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More...? Ugh. It feels... scratchy. Like sandpaper. And it hurts when I swallow. Everything hurts when I swallow. I haven't been eating much. Not that it matters. I just... want it gone. Is that clear enough? I don’t do well with… explanations.
DOCTOR: Okay, scratchy, like sandpaper, and painful swallowing – that gives me a better picture. And you haven't been eating much because of the pain. Alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or cough along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever...? Oh, I… I don’t know. I haven't been checking. I don't bother with all that. Chills… maybe? It gets cold in the house sometimes. Old house. And… a little cough, I suppose. Nothing major. Just a tickle. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know what you're going to do about the pain. I have things to manage. Very important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no measured temperature, a possible chill, and a mild cough. Okay. Now, have you noticed any white spots or pus on the back of your throat?
PATIENT: White spots...? Pus...? Oh, goodness. I haven't looked. I don't go poking around in my throat. That sounds… unpleasant. I wouldn’t know what to look for. Are you expecting me to… examine myself? Because I really don’t have the patience for that. Just tell me what's wrong and what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no, I wasn't expecting you to do a self-exam! I just need to take a look myself. It'll be quick. Let me grab a tongue depressor and a light. Then I’ll have a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just be quick about it. Honestly, all these questions… it’s a waste of time. I have… responsibilities. And I haven’t got all day. Just look, Doctor. And then fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, here we go. Open wide, please. Hmm. Okay, I see some redness and a little bit of swelling, but no obvious white spots or pus. Your tonsils don’t look particularly large. It looks like mild inflammation. Now, I'm going to feel your neck for any swollen lymph nodes. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh! That's… uncomfortable. Tender? Yes. It always feels tender. I have… a lot of stress. It’s probably just that. Don't poke too much. Honestly, Doctor, is this necessary? I’m not a child. Just tell me what you think it is and how to make it stop hurting. I really must get back to things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your discomfort and that you're busy. It sounds like you likely have a mild case of pharyngitis – that’s inflammation of the throat, often caused by a virus. The tenderness you're feeling in your neck suggests some mild lymph node swelling, which is common with an infection. Given your symptoms and the lack of high fever or other serious signs, it’s unlikely to be strep throat, but to be absolutely sure, and given your insurance situation, I would recommend a rapid strep test. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Strep test...? Insurance...? Oh, don’t even start with that. I told you, I don't have insurance. And honestly, I haven’t got time for tests. It’s just a sore throat. People get sore throats all the time! Is a test even necessary? What will a test even do? Just give me something to make the pain go away, Doctor. Please. I’m wasting precious time here. A simple remedy, if you please. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration and your need to get back to your responsibilities. Given your lack of insurance and the mild nature of your symptoms, we can proceed without a strep test. However, it’s important to be aware that without a test, we can’t definitively rule out strep throat. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve within a few days, it's important to seek further medical attention. For now, we can manage your symptoms with supportive care. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, throat lozenges, and plenty of fluids. Gargling with warm salt water can also help soothe your throat. I'll write down some instructions for you. Are you able to tolerate those options?
PATIENT: Salt water… lozenges… fine. I suppose. I’ve used those before. Pain relievers… yes, I have some of those at home. As long as they work. Honestly, Doctor, if this doesn't work, I don't know what I'll do. Just… write it down quickly. And then can I be on my way? I have a schedule to keep, you know. Important things. Very important. And please, no more poking.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This outlines the recommendations for managing your symptoms. If you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Also, remember to get plenty of rest. Viral infections can be quite draining. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Rest...? Honestly. No. That’s all. Just… this. Thank you. Or… whatever. I must be going now. I have things to manage. Very important things. Don’t bother calling me unless it’s absolutely necessary. Goodbye, Doctor. And please… no further appointments. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care. .
