DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Pipkorn, is it? Yes, lovely to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s a bit of a worry, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been after me to come. Said I’ve been… well, having these little spells, you see? Not often, but enough to make her nervous. And my husband… oh, he worries too. It's just… a weakness, sometimes, on one side. And my mother, she used to get terrible headaches… awful migraines. So, we thought it best to get it checked. I don’t remember everything clearly, you understand. It’s the age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Tofani. It's always wise to get these things checked out, and it’s good your daughter is looking out for you. “Little spells” and weakness on one side… could you describe those spells for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… describe them. Well, it’s not like I fall down or anything dramatic. It’s just… my arm, usually my right arm, feels… heavy. Like it’s not really mine, if that makes sense? And sometimes my face feels… droopy on that side too. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes, and then it goes away. It's hard to explain. It’s not painful, just… strange. And the headaches… well, they aren't my headaches, not like my mother’s. Just little ones, from time to time. Nothing a bit of aspirin can’t fix. Honestly, I probably worry about it more than it’s worth.
DOCTOR: So, a temporary weakness, primarily on the right side – affecting your arm and face – lasting a few minutes at a time. And you’ve also been experiencing occasional, mild headaches. Do you notice anything that triggers these episodes of weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… now that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. It doesn’t seem to be anything specific. It happens… just when it happens, you know? I haven’t noticed it after any particular activity, or when I’m stressed… although, truthfully, I’m rarely that stressed anymore. My husband does most of the worrying for both of us! I suppose… sometimes it feels worse when I’m tired, maybe? But I’m always a little tired these days. It’s just… random, I think. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. It can be difficult to pinpoint triggers, especially with intermittent symptoms. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – perhaps high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Let me see. Well, Doctor, I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, maybe twenty years back? The doctor put me on a little pill for it, but I don't take it anymore. He said it was under control. And my sugar… no, I don’t think so. Never been told I had anything like that. I try to eat sensible, you know? Lots of vegetables. My husband, he's the one who watches all that stuff. He’s very good at keeping track of things. Oh, and my knees… they bother me sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of previously treated hypertension, now resolved, and no known diabetes. Knee pain, likely osteoarthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think… Oh! Yes, actually. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Must be… forty years ago now? It was a bit of trouble, but everything went well. And… I think that’s it. Nothing else I can recall. Oh, and I’ve had a few wisdom teeth pulled, if that counts! But that was ages ago, when I was a young woman. It was all done at the dentist, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal forty years ago, wisdom teeth extractions. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tricky one. My mother, bless her soul, she had those terrible migraines. Awful, they were. She was bedridden for days sometimes. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don't remember much about it. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like I did. But other than that… not much I can recall. It wasn’t something we talked about much, you know? Family history. It was more about the everyday things.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of migraines in your mother, hypertension in your brother, and a father with heart issues. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… just a little glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. My husband enjoys a bit more, but I don’t really care for it. And recreational drugs… oh, dear, no! I’m an old Italian woman, Doctor! We drink coffee and eat pasta! Not… those things. I hope I’m answering your question correctly. It's just… it's not something I've ever thought about.
DOCTOR: Perfectly answered, Ms. Tofani. And a very sensible lifestyle, I might add. Finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… As I said, I don't take the pill for my blood pressure anymore. Sometimes, I take aspirin for a headache, but that's it. And no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me the same question, she's very careful. But no, nothing. Just the occasional aspirin. I think that’s everything. Is there anything else I should be telling you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological assessment – just to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A physical examination… sounds perfectly reasonable. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know. But go ahead, dear. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 148/92. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Cranial nerves appear intact. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities… although, I do notice a slight weakness on the right side, as you mentioned. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Sensory function is intact. Finally, I'll check your gait. Please stand and walk a few steps for me. Gait is stable, but slightly slower than expected. I also noticed a very subtle asymmetry in facial expression, more pronounced on the right side.
PATIENT: Oh, dear… all those numbers and terms… it’s a bit overwhelming, you know? A slight weakness, you say? Well, I did mention that. And my face… is it drooping? I hadn’t really noticed. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been feeling a bit… foggy lately. It’s hard to remember things, and I just feel… off sometimes. But I suppose that’s just old age. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, based on my examination, your symptoms and findings – the intermittent weakness, subtle facial asymmetry, and slightly elevated blood pressure – are concerning for a possible transient ischemic attack, or TIA. A TIA is often called a “mini-stroke,” and it’s caused by a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. It doesn’t cause permanent damage like a stroke, but it’s a warning sign that you’re at risk for a full stroke in the future. We need to determine the cause of this blockage and take steps to prevent it. It is serious, and requires further investigation. I’m going to order a blood test to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and other factors. I also recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any other potential causes. And I would like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a stroke? A “mini-stroke”? Goodness… that sounds frightening. I… I don’t understand. A blockage? In my brain? My mother… she never had a stroke. I just thought it was… old age. Foggy thinking, a bit of weakness… That's all I thought it was. Blood tests, a CT scan… a neurologist? Oh dear, it sounds like a lot. Is it… is it something I did? I try to eat healthy, I really do. And I don’t smoke, as I said. Is it… am I going to be alright, Doctor? Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit… scared.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be scared, Ms. Tofani. And it’s not your fault. TIAs are often caused by underlying conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or atrial fibrillation – conditions that aren’t necessarily preventable with a healthy lifestyle, although a healthy lifestyle can certainly help manage them. The blood tests and CT scan will help us identify the cause of the blockage and determine the best course of treatment. The neurologist will be able to provide a more detailed evaluation and recommend further steps. I want to be clear: a TIA is a warning sign, and it’s important to take it seriously. But with prompt diagnosis and treatment, we can significantly reduce your risk of a full stroke. We are going to take this one step at a time. I’ll order those tests right away. And I’ll have my nurse schedule an appointment for you with a neurologist as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… emergency room… That sounds… drastic. But I understand, I think. One step at a time… Yes. That’s good. The neurologist… will they… will they do more tests? And what kind of treatment would I need? And… is it possible it’s nothing? Could it just be… old age, like I said? I just don’t want to be… a burden to my daughter. She worries so much already.
DOCTOR: It’s reasonable to want to know what to expect, Ms. Tofani. The neurologist may order additional tests, such as an MRI of the brain, an echocardiogram to evaluate your heart, and a carotid ultrasound to check for blockages in the arteries in your neck. The treatment will depend on the underlying cause. It may involve medication to control blood pressure, lower cholesterol, or prevent blood clots. In some cases, a procedure may be necessary to clear blockages in the arteries. While it’s possible it could be something else, Ms. Tofani, your symptoms and my examination suggest a TIA is the most likely explanation. It’s important to rule out other possibilities and address the underlying cause to prevent a full stroke. And you are not a burden to your daughter. She cares about you and wants to make sure you’re healthy. This is simply a precaution, and we will work together to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. It just seems like… a lot to deal with. But… alright. If it will help prevent a stroke, I suppose I have to do it. The appointment with the neurologist… how long will that be? And will my insurance cover all of this? I don’t want to cause my daughter any financial trouble either. She’s already been helping me with the bills lately. And… is there anything I should be doing now? Besides waiting for the tests, of course. Should I be… avoiding anything? Eating anything special?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Tofani. Let me address them one by one. The appointment with the neurologist is typically scheduled within a week or two, depending on their availability. I will have my nurse contact your insurance company to confirm coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. They can also assist you with any financial concerns. In the meantime, it's important to continue taking any medications you're already prescribed, and to maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible. That includes eating a balanced diet – low in sodium and saturated fats – and getting regular exercise, as tolerated. Avoid smoking and limit your alcohol intake. Most importantly, please be vigilant for any new or worsening symptoms – sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, vision changes, or severe headache. If you experience any of these, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I will also write you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin, which can help prevent blood clots. And I’ll have my nurse provide you with some educational materials about TIAs and stroke prevention. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, aspirin… that sounds sensible. And educational materials… yes, that would be helpful. My daughter always says I should be more informed. I think… I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve answered all my questions. I’m still a bit worried, of course, but I feel… better knowing what to expect. Thank you for being so patient with me. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse to call and schedule the appointment. And try to… be vigilant, as you said.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Tofani. It was my pleasure to meet you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My nurse will be in touch shortly to schedule the appointment and provide you with the educational materials. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and please try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll make a note to follow up with you after your neurology appointment. .
PATIENT: .
