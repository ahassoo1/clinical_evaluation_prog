DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Bombara, is it? Lovely name. Well, now… what did bring me in? Hmm. It’s my ears, I think. They just don’t… hear like they used to. Things are a bit muffled, you know? Not awful, but… quieter. I mostly just ask people to speak up. Is that what you wanted to know? It's been goin’ on for a while now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Schneer. So, muffled hearing, gradually worsening over time. And you're finding yourself needing people to repeat things or speak louder. Do you notice it's worse in certain situations?
PATIENT: Oh, situations… let me think. Yes, I suppose it is. When there’s a lot of noise, like… at the church social last month? Couldn’t make heads or tails of what anyone was saying. And the television… I have to turn it up pretty loud, and even then, sometimes I miss things. Not all the time, mind you. Just… when it’s busy. Does that make sense? I don't rightly remember when it started being worse in crowds… time gets away from ya, you know.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Schneer. It’s very common for hearing to be affected more in noisy environments. And you're right, time does get away from us. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you've been a patient here for a while. Are you generally in good health otherwise?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, mostly good. A few aches and pains, what with being… well, my age, of course. But nothing serious, I don’t think. I get a bit tired quicker than I used to, but that’s to be expected. I had a touch of the flu a couple years back, but bounced right back. I get my Medicare benefits taken care of, you see. Old man Hemlock down the street helped me sort all that out. A good lad, that Hemlock. Now, what was we talkin’ about? My health… yes. Fair enough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Fair enough, yes. So, generally good health, a bit of fatigue, and a bout of the flu a couple of years ago. No other major illnesses that you recall?
PATIENT: No… not that I remember. I used to work at the shoe factory, you know. Shoe Machine Operator, they called it. Lots of noise there, come to think of it. Maybe that had somethin’ to do with it? Been retired for… oh, goodness, must be twenty years now. I kept pretty busy after that, gardening and such. But no illnesses. Not really. Oh, wait! I had a bad fall last spring, tripped over the cat. Bruised my hip somethin’ awful, but that healed up. But that wasn't an illness, per se... is it? I get mixed up sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, a fall isn't an illness, Mr. Schneer. It’s good you remember that. And you're right to mention the noise at the shoe factory—that could certainly have contributed. Just to get a complete picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than that fall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I think… yes! When I was a young man, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago. And… oh dear. This is difficult. I think I was in the hospital once for… a bad stomach bug? But it was so long ago, I can’t rightly recall much about it. Maybe I was just very sick at home. Everything’s a bit fuzzy these days, you know. I don't think there was anythin’ major. I mostly just got through things. Did I mention Hemlock? Good lad, that one. Helps me with everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. It’s common to have trouble remembering details from long ago. Tonsils out as a young man, and a possible stomach bug a long time ago. Now, thinking about your family—are there any hearing problems or ear issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… now that’s a tough one. I never really talked much about health with my folks. They weren’t ones for doctorin’, if you get my meanin’. My brother, bless his soul, he was always a bit hard of hearin’ as he got older, but he worked on the railroad, awful loud job, that was. Never knew if it was the work or just… old age. My sister… she was fine, I think. Didn’t seem to have any trouble. Oh, wait! My cousin, Agnes, she wore a hearin’ aid for years. But she was a bit… eccentric, always goin’ to fancy doctors and such. So, I don’t know if that counts. It’s all a bit muddled, I’m afraid. Do you want me to ask Hemlock? He's good with these things.
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry about asking Hemlock, Mr. Schneer. That gives me a good idea. A bit of hearing loss in your brother and cousin. Now, just a few more quick questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh! Yes, the doctor gave me somethin’ for my arthritis a few years back, but I stopped takin’ it. Didn't seem to do much good, and it upset my stomach. I take a multivitamin every day, the one with the little gummy bears. And sometimes, when my joints are achin’ awful bad, I take a bit of ibuprofen. That helps some. But that’s about it. Nothing fancy. Mostly just the gummies. And the ibuprofen when needed. Is that enough? I hope I’m not borin’ you with all this.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schneer. This is all very helpful. So, a multivitamin daily, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis pain. Now, before we move on to a quick exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with food. I eat pretty much anything. I remember when I was a boy, my mother made me try everything. No hives, no swelling, nothin’. I think I might have gotten a bit of a rash once when I brushed against some poison ivy, but that wasn’t an allergy, exactly, was it? No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Not that I recall. I get a bit sniffly in the spring, but I think that’s just the pollen. Everyone gets that, don’t they? Should I be worried about somethin’?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Schneer. That’s good to know. Just a bit of spring pollen. Alright, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick exam of your ears, just to get a better look. It won't take long, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had my ears looked at in… goodness, must be years. Go right ahead. Just tell me if it’s gonna be cold or somethin’. My ears are a bit sensitive. You do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. I'm just going to gently insert this instrument into your ear canal to take a look at your eardrum. It might feel a little cool, as you mentioned. Hmm… some cerumen—wax buildup—in the canal. And the eardrum appears… slightly retracted. Not severely, but noticeable. Similar findings on this side—wax buildup, and mild retraction of the eardrum. Okay, both ears have some wax buildup and mild eardrum retraction. I’ll need to document these findings. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a general assessment of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible. Wax buildup… well, I do clean my ears with those little cotton swabs sometimes. Maybe I shouldn't be doin' that? My mother always told me not to, but… I like to keep things tidy, you know? And listen to my heart and lungs, yes, go right ahead. I’m a fairly sturdy fella, all things considered. Nothing much wrong with my heart, I expect. Used to walk miles every day. Take your time, Doctor. No rush.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. I do hear some mild crackles at the bases, which could be from a bit of fluid buildup. Again, not overly concerning at this point, but something to keep an eye on. Okay, everything sounds reasonably normal, though your heart sounds are a bit quiet, and there’s mild crackling in your lungs. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood pressure, yes. I always get a bit nervous when they take my blood pressure. My cousin Agnes used to have awfully high blood pressure, always worryin' about strokes and such. But I've been fairly healthy, all things considered. I eat my vegetables, you know. And I don't smoke. So hopefully, everything’s alright. Just let me know if anything's amiss, Doctor. You're the expert.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Your blood pressure is 140/85, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll want to monitor that. Now, let me think… based on what you've told me and my quick exam, it sounds like your hearing loss is likely due to a combination of age-related changes and wax buildup. The mild crackling in your lungs could be due to a bit of fluid buildup, possibly from some mild congestion. And the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to keep an eye on. I recommend we start by removing the wax buildup in your ears. That could significantly improve your hearing. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications to help lower your blood pressure, such as diet and exercise. And I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to recheck your hearing and blood pressure. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Remove the wax, you say? Good idea. I’ve been meaning to get that done for ages. And lifestyle changes… well, I suppose I could walk a bit more. I used to walk miles every day, but I’ve gotten a bit lazy lately. And eat more vegetables, you’re right. All good advice. A follow-up appointment in a month… yes, that sounds fine. I trust your judgment. Just let me know when and where. You’ve put my mind at ease, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. Alright, I’ll have the nurse schedule you for a wax removal appointment next week. She'll also give you some information about lifestyle modifications for high blood pressure. And we’ll see you back in a month to follow up. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your hearing, or develop any chest pain or shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. Wax removal, follow-up appointment, watch for changes… I’ll remember all that. And thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. It’s nice to have someone explain things clearly. You’re a good doctor, Doctor Bombara. A very good doctor. I think that’s all I need to say.
DOCTOR: You're very kind, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and we'll see you next week.
