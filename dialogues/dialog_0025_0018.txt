DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Verbose, good afternoon. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be… going to the restroom rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. It’s been happening for a little while now, I believe. Though, to be honest, pinpointing when it started escapes me at the moment. It just… is.
DOCTOR: “Rather frequently,” alright. And when you say “more than usual,” can you give me a sense of what usual is for you, Mr. Verbose?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Usual… well, I suppose, as one gets older… one visits the restroom more often, naturally. But this is… beyond that. I used to be able to go a good portion of the day without needing to go. Now, it feels like every couple of hours, at least. Perhaps three. It’s hard to say definitively. And sometimes, even less than that. It's... disruptive, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Disruptive. Right. And is it just frequency, or are you experiencing any urgency?
PATIENT: Urgency… yes, I believe so. It’s not… a sudden, overwhelming need, necessarily. But when I do feel the need, it's… insistent. I wouldn’t say painful, but definitely something I need to attend to promptly. It's not something I can comfortably ignore for long. Though, truthfully, I’m not entirely sure what “comfortable” even means in this context anymore. Is that clear? I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: “Promptly.” Alright. And are you noticing any change in your urine?
PATIENT: Change in my… urine? That is… a rather specific question. I suppose… it seems clear enough. I haven’t noticed any blood, if that’s what you’re asking. The color… well, it’s the usual shades of yellow, I believe. Perhaps a bit lighter than it used to be, now that you mention it. But I don't pay terribly close attention, I must confess. I'm not a medical professional, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this increased frequency and urgency?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I have been feeling a bit… thirsty, perhaps? Though, it's been quite warm lately, so that might be the weather. And… I suppose I’ve been a little more tired than usual. But that could be just… getting older. I find it difficult to distinguish between age-related fatigue and something more concerning, truthfully. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps if you give me an example, it might jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t believe so. I haven't taken my temperature, but I haven’t felt warm or unwell in that way. No chills, no sweating… just the… increased restroom visits and the slight thirst. I do apologize for my inability to be more precise, Doctor. I wish I could offer more definitive information.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mr. Verbose, you're a 56-year-old male. Your weight is… 141. That's… rather low, isn't it?
PATIENT: Is it? Yes, I suppose it is. I haven't really… kept track, to be honest. I've always been… slender, I suppose. I haven't noticed any weight loss, per se. It's just… always been this way. Is that a cause for concern, Doctor? Should I be eating more? I have been a bit preoccupied with… other things lately, and haven't been focusing on my diet as much as I probably should.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Verbose, given your age, symptoms, and… frankly, your weight, we need to rule a few things out. It could be something simple, like an overactive bladder. But we can't rule out diabetes. We need to do some bloodwork. And a urinalysis, of course. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Bloodwork and a… urinalysis. I suppose it’s better to be thorough. I trust your judgment. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Should I avoid drinking anything beforehand, or…? Just let me know, and I’ll do my best to comply. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this matter.
DOCTOR: Alright. For the bloodwork, you'll need to fast for eight hours beforehand. No food or drinks, except water. For the urinalysis, just a standard sample. We’ll have you collect that here in the office. The nurse will give you instructions. I'm also going to order a complete metabolic panel, just to get a wider picture of things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… comprehensive. Eight hours fasting, a water-only restriction. And a standard urine sample, collected here in the office. A complete metabolic panel… excellent. Whatever information you need, Doctor, I’m happy to provide it. I just want to understand what’s happening. Perhaps if you could tell me when the nurse will be available? I'm not sure how long these tests will take, and I have a… rather vague appointment later this afternoon. I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: The nurse, Brenda, is available now. We can get it done before you leave. It shouldn't take long. After the results come back, we'll schedule a follow-up to discuss them. Don't drink a lot of fluids before the urine sample, but don’t dehydrate yourself either. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly clear. Brenda is available now. No excessive fluids, but no dehydration. I'll go with Brenda immediately, then. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience with my… lack of specificity. I sometimes feel as though I’m speaking in riddles. I shall see Brenda now, then. Is her office nearby?
DOCTOR: Third door on the left. She’s expecting you. And try to be a little more… forthcoming next time, Mr. Verbose. It makes things easier for everyone.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The third door on the left. I shall endeavor to be… more forthcoming. Thank you again for your time and attention. Third door on the left… I do hope I remember. .
