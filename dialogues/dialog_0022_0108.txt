DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, I ain't one for pleasantries. Just... bleeding. From down there. Been happenin' a bit, and it's gettin' old. Not a pretty sight, I can tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. You're experiencing bleeding from the rectum, and it's becoming more frequent. That's certainly not something you want to ignore. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: "A little more?" What's that supposed to mean? Look, it's blood, alright? Red blood. Sometimes it's just a spot when I wipe, other times… well, other times it's more than a spot. It ain't like a waterfall, but it's enough to make a mess, if you catch my drift. And it's been goin' on, oh, I dunno… maybe a month or so? Started kinda slow, now it's…consistent. Mostly after I…you know. Use the bathroom. Is that enough detail for ya? I don't enjoy talkin' about this.
DOCTOR: No, that is helpful, Mr. Gentz. Thank you for being as specific as you can. It sounds like the bleeding is related to bowel movements and has been increasing over the past month. You mentioned it's mostly after using the bathroom. Is it mixed in with the stool, or is it separate?
PATIENT: Separate. Definitely separate. It ain't in the stool, it’s… on it, or just kinda drippin’ after. And look, don't get all technical with me, alright? I ain't a doctor. It's blood, it comes out my backside, and it’s gettin’ worse. Is that simple enough? I gotta ask, though...is this somethin’ serious? My wife… well, she always said I should go to the doctor for everything. But she’s gone now, and frankly, I don’t see the point in worryin’ about every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. And I apologize if I was being too technical. You’re right, it’s important to keep things simple. Separate blood with bowel movements, increasing over a month... that definitely warrants investigation. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It's completely understandable you're hesitant. But even small things can sometimes be important, and it’s good to rule things out, for your own peace of mind if nothing else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – like constipation, diarrhea, or a feeling of incomplete emptying?
PATIENT: Constipation? Nah, not really. I go when I go. Sometimes it’s a bit…hard, I guess. Old man problems. But nothin’ major. Diarrhea? No, thankfully. And no, I don’t feel like I’m not gettin’ everything out. It's all…normal, besides the blood, obviously. Look, I eat pretty regular, not a lot of fancy stuff. Steak, potatoes, you know. Maybe a bit too much coffee, but what’s life without coffee? And I don’t drink much, haven’t since… well, since she passed. So it ain’t that. What are ya thinkin’ it is? Just tell me straight. I don't like beatin' around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I appreciate your honesty. So, normal bowel habits generally, just a bit of occasional hardness, and you've cut back on alcohol. That's helpful to know. It's difficult to say definitively what's causing the bleeding without a proper examination. Several things could be responsible, ranging from relatively minor issues like hemorrhoids or anal fissures, to something more concerning. That’s why we need to investigate. To start, I’d like to perform a physical exam. This will involve a visual inspection of the area and a digital rectal exam – meaning I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel for any abnormalities. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it provides valuable information. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A…finger? Look, Doc, I really don't like the sound of that. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't ya just…give me somethin’ for hemorrhoids or somethin’? I've heard of those cream things. Honestly, the thought of a finger… it’s just…not appealin'. My wife always took care of all this. I never had to deal with any of this before. Is there any other way? I ain’t a fan of bein’ poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz. It's perfectly reasonable to feel uncomfortable with a digital rectal exam. And I apologize again for not explaining the necessity more clearly. The exam allows me to check for hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and feel for any masses or abnormalities that could be causing the bleeding. While hemorrhoid cream might help if hemorrhoids are the cause, we need to know what we're dealing with first. Applying cream without knowing the cause could potentially mask a more serious problem and delay proper diagnosis and treatment. To be thorough, and to rule out anything concerning, the exam is the best first step. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. It’s important to remember I’ve performed these exams many times, and my priority is to get you a clear answer. However, if you are absolutely opposed to the exam at this time, we could start with a stool test to check for blood. This wouldn’t give us a complete picture, but it could provide some initial information. But please understand that if the bleeding continues or worsens, we would still need to consider a more thorough evaluation, including the exam or potentially a referral to a specialist. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, you're makin' me feel worse just talkin' about it. Fine. Do the finger thing. Get it over with. But be quick about it, alright? And gentle, like you said. I just… I really don’t wanna be lyin’ here all day feelin’ uncomfortable. I got things to do. Mostly nothin’, but still. Just… let's get it done. But seriously, if you find anything bad, just tell me straight. No sugarcoatin'. I can handle it. I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for agreeing, Mr. Gentz. I appreciate your willingness to proceed. And I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Before we begin, I want to explain what you might feel. You may feel some pressure, and perhaps a slight urge to have a bowel movement, but it shouldn't be painful. If you do experience any pain or discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. I'm going to ask you to lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll apply some lubricant to the glove and gently insert it into your rectum. I will then be feeling around for any abnormalities. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Don't stand there talkin' to me all day. Yeah, I'm ready. Let's go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. That’s done. I did feel some internal hemorrhoids, which explains some of the bleeding. However, I also felt a small nodule on the left side of your rectum that is a bit firm and doesn't feel like a typical hemorrhoid. It's small, but it’s something we need to investigate further. There was also a small amount of dark, old blood on the glove. Because of the nodule, I recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. This is a procedure where they use a camera to examine the entire colon and rectum to determine the cause of the bleeding and to take a biopsy of the nodule if necessary. It's the most accurate way to diagnose the problem. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A nodule? What do you mean, a nodule? Is that… bad? Like, cancer bad? My brother, he… he had somethin’ in his colon. Didn’t end well. Is that what you’re tellin’ me? A colonoscopy… that sounds awful. Is it painful? And what about… biopsy? What does that even mean? Just tell me straight, Doc. Is it serious? I don't need fancy medical words, just tell me what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, please try to stay calm. I understand your concern, especially given your brother’s experience. It’s completely natural to be worried. A nodule simply means a small lump. It doesn’t automatically mean cancer. Many nodules are benign – meaning not cancerous. However, because of the location and firmness I felt, it’s important to investigate further to rule out any possibility of something more serious. A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to examine the entire colon. It’s usually painless, as you’re given medication to make you comfortable and relaxed. You might feel some pressure or bloating afterwards, but it's generally well-tolerated. A biopsy means taking a small sample of the nodule to examine under a microscope. This is the only way to definitively determine if it’s cancerous or not. It’s a quick procedure done during the colonoscopy. I’m not trying to scare you, Mr. Gentz. I’m simply being thorough. I want to get you a clear diagnosis so we can develop the appropriate treatment plan. The gastroenterologist will be able to explain the procedure in more detail and answer any questions you have. I’ll write a referral for you right now. Would you like me to help you find a gastroenterologist, or do you have one in mind?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t have anyone. You find someone. Someone good. And… look, Doc, if it is bad… what then? What happens if it’s cancer? I don’t want to be stuck in a hospital gettin’ poked and prodded and… and all that. I just want to know… what are my options? Be honest with me. No sugarcoatin’. I'm a simple man. Just tell me what I'm lookin' at. And… is there anythin’ I can do now? Anythin’ at all to… I dunno… make it better? Before I gotta go see this… this specialist?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand your fear and anxiety. It’s good you’re asking these questions. If the colonoscopy reveals cancer, the treatment options depend on the stage and location of the cancer. These can include surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon, chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, and radiation therapy. Sometimes, a combination of these treatments is used. The goal is always to remove the cancer and prevent it from spreading. I want to assure you that cancer treatment has come a long way, and many people live full and healthy lives after treatment. The gastroenterologist will be able to discuss your specific options in detail if cancer is found. For now, before you see the specialist, there are a few things you can do. Maintaining a healthy diet rich in fiber can help prevent constipation and reduce irritation to the colon. Staying hydrated is also important. And avoid straining during bowel movements. I’m going to write down a referral for Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s an excellent gastroenterologist with a good reputation. I’ll also include her contact information and instructions on how to schedule an appointment. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I want you to know I'm here to support you through this process. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's… enough for now. Just… get me the referral. And… thanks, Doc. I appreciate you bein’ honest with me. Even if it’s… not what I wanted to hear. I just… I gotta process all this. And… I guess I gotta call this Dr. Vance. I don’t like callin’ doctors. It always makes me feel… helpless. But I will. I will call. .
