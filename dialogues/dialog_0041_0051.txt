DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. I'm Dr. Polczynski, but you can call me Derell. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Derell. It is nice to meet you as well. Let me see… what brought me in… My goodness, it slips my mind so easily these days. Something about… blood? Yes, that’s it. I need to know my blood type, I think. My… someone told me I should, recently. A friend, maybe? Or a family member… It’s all a bit foggy, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, blood type. No problem at all, that's a very sensible thing to check. And it’s perfectly normal for things to be a little foggy sometimes, especially as we get older. Just to be sure, was there anything specific that prompted this request?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… No, not that I recall. I just… feel like it’s important to know, you know? For… emergencies, perhaps? Or… if I ever needed a… a transfusion? I do a lot of rigging work, you see, and things can be a little dangerous. Though, I’ve been doing it for… well, a very long time. Honestly, I wish I could remember who suggested it. It’s terribly frustrating!
DOCTOR: It is good to be prepared, and knowing your blood type is a great step. Rigging work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, rigging. Always have loved it. My husband… well, my late husband, he was a rigger too. We met on a… a film set, I believe. A very big one, but the name… it escapes me. We built… structures, you see. For the cameras. It's… physical work, but I enjoy it. Keeps me moving. Though these old bones do complain a bit these days. Do you… know much about rigging?
DOCTOR: I don't have personal experience with rigging, no, but I've treated a few folks who do similar types of work. It sounds like it requires a good deal of strength and precision. And yes, I can imagine it puts a strain on the body. Before we get to checking your blood type, I'd like to ask a few questions, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s nice to hear! It does take both, you’re right. And a good head for heights! Questions? Yes, of course. Ask away. I’ll do my best to answer, though, as I said, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. We’ll take it slow. First, have you ever had any problems with bleeding—like easy bruising, nosebleeds that are hard to stop, or bleeding that lasts a long time after a cut?
PATIENT: Hmm… bleeding. Let me think. Nosebleeds, yes, I’ve had a few in my time. But nothing… terrible, I don’t think. I bruise easily, that's true. But I’m an older woman! I’d expect a bit of bruising, wouldn’t you? As for cuts… they bleed like any normal cut, I suppose. Nothing that required a… a doctor’s attention. Not recently, anyway. I did have a rather nasty scrape on my knee last year, falling off a ladder, but that stopped bleeding fairly quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And have you ever been told you have a bleeding disorder, or anything like that?
PATIENT: A bleeding disorder? No, never. No one ever told me anything like that. I’ve been to doctors over the years, of course, but they never mentioned anything about… a problem with my blood. I’ve always just been a bit… delicate, perhaps. As a young woman, I fainted easily. But that’s hardly a bleeding disorder, is it?
DOCTOR: No, fainting isn’t a bleeding disorder. Just trying to cover all the bases. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… Let me see. I take something for my… arthritis, I believe. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take… ibuprofen? Yes, that’s it. A blue one. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor suggested it. Something about the sun, you see. I don’t think that’s all. But my mind is… blanking. I do try to keep things simple. It’s easy to forget when you get to my age, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Vitamin D, arthritis medication and ibuprofen. That’s a good start. Do you have the names of the arthritis medication, or perhaps bring the bottles with you next time?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The names… No, I haven’t the faintest. I just ask the pharmacist to give me what the doctor prescribes. I don’t bother with the names. Silly of me, I suppose. I can ask my daughter to bring the bottles next time, if that would be helpful? She’s very organized, my daughter. Unlike me!
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, thank you. Now, just one more quick question before we move on to the blood type test. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me think. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes, my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s just the heat, I think. Or maybe it’s the soap. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. I eat everything, I’m afraid! Though I don’t care much for Brussels sprouts. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, not an allergy. Alright, that’s very good to know. So, it sounds like no known allergies. Now, let's go ahead and get that blood type checked for you. We’ll just need a small sample. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. A small sample, you say? That doesn’t sound too bad. I’ve had blood taken before, of course. It’s just a little… poke, isn’t it? Go ahead, dear. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, and we’ll get this done quickly. I'll need to clean the area on your arm first, and then just a little pinch. Cleaning the antecubital fossa now…skin intact, no visible lesions. Preparing the tourniquet…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A tourniquet, you say? That sounds… serious. But I trust you, dear. Just let me know when you’re about to… poke me. I always did hate needles, even as a little girl. But needs must, I suppose. Is it cold in here? It feels a bit chilly.
DOCTOR: Applying the tourniquet now, comfortably snug. Just a little pinch, as you said. It's very quick, I promise. And you're right, it is a little chilly in here. I'll adjust the thermostat in a moment. There we go. All done. Just a little pressure here for a moment to stop any bleeding. Apply pressure for 3 minutes. Good job. You did great. Now we just wait a few minutes for the sample to settle and I can run the test. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Oh, good. It’s done already? That was quick. A little sting, yes, but nothing terrible. A few minutes… I wonder what my blood type is? I suppose it doesn’t really matter, does it? As long as they know it if I ever… need a transfusion. Yes, that’s it. Just need to be prepared. Perhaps I should call my daughter later. Just to check in. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Darl, I have your results back. You are type O positive. Do you know what your blood type is?
PATIENT: O positive… No, I don’t think so. Never had occasion to find out before. O positive… Is that… good? Is that a common one? What does that mean, exactly?
DOCTOR: Yes, O positive is very common. It’s one of the most frequent blood types. It means you have type O blood, and you have the Rh positive factor. Being type O is good because it's a universal donor type, meaning your blood can be given to people with many different blood types. However, you can only receive blood from O positive or O negative donors. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Universal donor… Oh, that is good, isn’t it? So I can help people? That’s nice. Only receive from O positive or negative… I think I understand. It’s a bit complicated, though. All these positives and negatives… So, if I ever needed a blood transfusion, they’d have to make sure it was O positive or O negative? And they wouldn’t be able to give me just any blood? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Exactly right. They would need to make sure it’s a compatible type – O positive or O negative. It's good to know in case of an emergency. We'll make a note of it in your chart, and you can always carry a medical ID card if you wish. Do you have any other questions about your blood type, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: A medical ID card… Yes, that’s a good idea. My daughter would approve of that. She’s very organized, you see. Always thinking ahead. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, dear. Thank you. It’s a relief to finally know my blood type. Just one less thing to worry about. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go have a nice cup of tea. All this talk of blood has made me a bit thirsty.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’m glad I could help, Darl. Here’s a printout of your results for your records, and I'll have the nurse give you the information on how to obtain a medical ID card. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any other questions or concerns. Enjoy your tea, and please be careful with the rigging work! .
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, dear. You've been very kind. I will be careful, I promise. And I will tell my daughter to call if I forget anything. Have a lovely day, Derell. And thank you again. .
