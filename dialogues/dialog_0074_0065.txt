DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… gaining weight, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s quite perplexing, really. It’s been happening for about three months now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: I understand. That can certainly be frustrating. Weight gain without any changes to your diet or exercise routine is something we should investigate. About three months… alright. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about how much weight you’ve gained over those three months, if you have an estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I weigh myself every week, religiously. About fifteen pounds, I believe. Perhaps a little more. It’s unsettling, because I am very careful with what I eat. I don't eat a lot of processed foods, and I try to walk at least thirty minutes every day. It’s just… appearing. I haven’t a clue why.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds over three months, with no changes to your habits. That is concerning, and it's good you're paying attention to it. You mentioned you're careful with your diet – can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. For breakfast, I usually have oatmeal with a handful of berries, and a small cup of black coffee. Lunch is often a salad with grilled chicken or fish, and a light vinaigrette. Dinner… well, it varies. Sometimes it’s roasted vegetables with lean protein, sometimes soup, always something relatively healthy. I do enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner, perhaps two squares. And, as I said, I drink plenty of water throughout the day. I really don’t indulge much, Doctor. It’s quite baffling.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy diet, Ms. Selbitschka. And you mentioned daily walks – are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I do try. As for other symptoms… well, I’ve been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And my skin… it’s been a bit dry, despite drinking enough water. Oh, and I’ve noticed I feel cold more easily. It’s August, and I’m still reaching for a sweater some evenings. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, those symptoms could be relevant, Ms. Selbitschka. Fatigue, dry skin, and increased sensitivity to cold can sometimes be associated with a slower metabolism. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Let me think… no, not really. Everything seems… regular, if you’ll pardon the expression. Perhaps a little sluggish at times, but nothing alarming. I take a fiber supplement most mornings, which usually helps. I haven’t noticed anything drastically different in that regard, no. Is that important, Doctor? I apologize if I’m being…dense.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being dense at all, Ms. Selbitschka. I just want to be thorough. It's good to hear your bowel habits are generally regular. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized for anything, and I don't take any regular medications. My husband, he has high blood pressure, but I do not. I see a dentist twice a year for check-ups, and I had a mammogram last year, which was normal. I'm usually very good about my preventative care.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Selbitschka. No significant medical history, regular preventative care. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type two, but she developed it quite late in life, in her seventies. My father had heart disease. Both of them smoked for many years, unfortunately. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… I believe it was arthritis. A rather bad case of it. Nothing else springs to mind immediately, Doctor. Is there something specific you're looking for? I’m happy to try and recall anything else.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Diabetes, heart disease, arthritis… alright. Now, to finish up with the background information, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I walk daily. I live with my husband, we’ve been married for twenty-three years. He retired from the factory last year, so he's home most of the time now. We enjoy gardening, and reading. We don’t drink alcohol, and we don’t smoke. I work as an orderly at the local hospital, mostly light duties. It keeps me on my feet, but it's not overly strenuous. We don't have any children. I lead a fairly quiet life, Doctor. Perhaps a little too quiet now that my husband is retired. Is that the sort of thing you were asking about?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Selbitschka. Quiet lifestyle, no smoking, healthy habits… It all paints a good picture, which makes this weight gain even more puzzling. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your thyroid gland, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure and pulse. It will just be a quick assessment to rule out any obvious causes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I'm eager to find out what's causing this, and I trust your judgment. I understand you need to investigate, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could please sit up straight for me. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/82, which is within the normal range. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m palpating your thyroid. It feels… slightly enlarged, and there’s a little bit of tenderness. It’s not dramatically enlarged, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation. I don’t feel any significant nodules. Based on this brief exam, the slightly enlarged and tender thyroid is the most concerning finding. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, as well as a complete metabolic panel to rule out other potential causes for the weight gain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood tests seem a logical next step. I'm happy to have them done. I'd appreciate knowing what we're looking for, if you wouldn't mind explaining it in layman's terms. I don't need every detail, of course, but a general idea would be helpful. I trust your expertise, but I do like to understand what's happening with my body, if that doesn't sound too presumptuous.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s always good to be informed. The thyroid is a small gland in your neck that controls your metabolism – essentially, how your body uses energy. The blood tests will check the levels of various thyroid hormones. If your thyroid isn’t producing enough hormone – a condition called hypothyroidism – it can cause weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, and increased sensitivity to cold, which are the symptoms you've been experiencing. The complete metabolic panel will give us a broader picture of your overall health and rule out other possibilities, like diabetes or kidney problems. It's a routine test, and it will give us a good starting point. Do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no allergies at all. Not to medications, not to foods, nothing. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m a fairly straightforward case, I assure you. Although, clearly not that straightforward, if we're talking about this weight gain! But, no allergies. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It does ease my mind to understand what we're looking for.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Selbitschka. No allergies. Alright, I'll write up the lab order now. You can go to the lab just down the hall, and they should be able to draw the blood right away. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant changes in your energy levels – please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and your clear explanations. I’m a little anxious about the results, of course, but I feel much better knowing we’re investigating this properly. I’ll go to the lab now, and I’ll await your call. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
