DOCTOR: Hi Jarvis, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been… experimenting with my diet, shall we say. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I… continue. It’s a bit of a silly thing, perhaps, for a man of my age to be attempting, but one gets bored, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jarvis. It's never silly to be curious or try new things, regardless of age. And it’s very smart of you to check in with a doctor beforehand. “Experimenting with your diet” – could you tell me a bit more about what that involves?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began innocently enough, with a rather restrictive juice cleanse, inspired by a younger colleague. That… didn’t suit me. Then I moved on to a rather… enthusiastic protein-only regimen. Very popular with the bodybuilders, you know. Now, I’ve been attempting a diet based entirely on foods that are coloured blue. It’s… proving more challenging than anticipated. I read about it online, naturally. One finds all sorts of things these days.
DOCTOR: A blue food diet… fascinating. And you’ve been following this for how long, Jarvis?
PATIENT: Approximately ten days now, Doctor. Ten days of blueberries, blue corn tortillas – surprisingly difficult to find, I assure you – and an alarming amount of blue spirulina. It began with a certain… vitality, but I’m finding my energy levels are… fluctuating. And frankly, the lack of variety is beginning to weigh on my spirits. I've always prided myself on a robust palate, you see. Though, I must admit, the aesthetic is quite striking. Everything is quite blue.
DOCTOR: I can imagine. Ten days is long enough to start noticing some effects. And you're right to be concerned about variety – a balanced diet is crucial. You mentioned fluctuating energy levels – can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's not a consistent fatigue, Doctor. More like… waves. A rather brilliant burst of energy for perhaps an hour or two, followed by a period of… lassitude. A general feeling of… not quite being present, if you understand. And, if I’m being entirely honest, my sleep has been rather disrupted. Vivid dreams, mostly involving… cerulean landscapes. Rather foolish, I suspect, to attempt such a thing. But one does get a bit carried away.
DOCTOR: It does sound a bit unusual, Jarvis. Those symptoms – the energy fluctuations and disrupted sleep – could certainly be related to the diet. Cerulean landscapes, though… that's a new one! Let's do a quick check-up, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at you generally. And perhaps we can run a few basic blood tests to see if anything is obviously out of balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A thorough examination is precisely what I require, I believe. I’ve always been a proponent of empirical evidence, you see. Yes, blood tests are an excellent idea. And please, do feel free to ask if anything seems… peculiar. I’m quite accustomed to unusual requests, given my profession. One encounters all sorts of things when constructing fantastical creatures, you see.
DOCTOR: Fantastical creatures! That does explain a lot. If you’d like to change into this gown, and we’ll get started. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Then we’ll get the bloodwork ordered. Is there anything I should know before I begin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe I’ve divulged all pertinent information. Though, if you happen to notice a faint shimmer, please disregard it. It’s a residual effect of a rather ambitious project involving holographic scales. And please, do not be alarmed if I occasionally lapse into technical jargon. It’s a rather ingrained habit. I’ve spent rather a long time explaining the intricacies of particle effects, you see.
DOCTOR: Holographic scales… fascinating. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not easily alarmed. I’ve encountered quite a few unusual cases myself. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion?
PATIENT: Certainly. No, Doctor, I don’t believe I do. I maintain a rather active lifestyle, despite my age. I frequently take long walks, and I'm rather fond of gardening. Though, I must admit, even digging in the soil feels slightly… more arduous than usual. Perhaps it’s simply the weather. It’s been rather humid lately, you see. And, if I may say so, a rather trying shade of grey. It lacks the vibrancy one expects from a summer’s day. One becomes rather particular, I suppose, when one dedicates one's life to creating illusions.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, good and strong. Lungs are clear, but you're right, taking those deep breaths sounds a little… labored. Not alarming, but worth noting. Any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain or tenderness. A slight… discomfort, perhaps, but nothing beyond the usual digestive grumbles. I've always had a rather sensitive constitution, you see. And, if I may add, the limited variety in my diet is undoubtedly contributing to the… internal unrest. Blueberries, while delightful, lack the fiber one requires for optimal functionality. It’s a rather ironic situation, isn’t it? A specialist in creating believable realities, undone by the constraints of a monochromatic one.
DOCTOR: It is rather ironic, you're right. And it's a good reminder that even the most fantastical endeavors need to be grounded in… well, reality. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. It could be a bit of anxiety about the diet, or simply the weather. Everything else seems fairly normal on the physical exam. Given your symptoms and the… unusual nature of your diet, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and a complete blood count. That will give us a better picture of what's going on. Also, I'm going to recommend you see a registered dietitian. They can help you create a balanced meal plan that doesn’t involve solely blue foods. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A thorough investigation is precisely what I require, and a registered dietitian is an excellent suggestion. I’ve always appreciated a pragmatic approach, you see. I confess, the prospect of a less… cerulean existence is rather appealing. And if the blood tests reveal any… peculiarities, please do not hesitate to inform me. I’m quite accustomed to dealing with the unexpected, given my profession. One encounters all sorts of things when constructing fantastical creatures, you see. Though, I do hope it's nothing too dramatic. I have a rather demanding deadline approaching, you see. A griffin requires a rather complex skeletal structure, you wouldn't believe.
DOCTOR: A griffin's skeletal structure… fascinating. I can only imagine. Alright, I'm ordering the blood tests now. They should be ready in a couple of days. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also print out a referral for a registered dietitian. They'll be able to help you with a more sustainable meal plan. In the meantime, I strongly recommend gradually reintroducing a variety of foods into your diet. Don’t try to switch back overnight. And stay well hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. The gradual reintroduction of sustenance is a sensible precaution, and I shall heed your advice. I suppose my only remaining query pertains to the… cerulean landscapes. Is there any possibility the diet has induced some form of… neurological effect? I confess, the dreams have been rather vivid, and I’m rather concerned about their potential impact on my creative process. A griffin requires a certain level of… mental clarity, you wouldn't believe. Perhaps I'm simply becoming overly fanciful in my old age.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Jarvis. It's unlikely the diet is causing a serious neurological effect, but it could be contributing to the vivid dreams. Restrictive diets and significant dietary changes can sometimes affect sleep patterns and dream recall. It's also possible the dreams are simply a result of stress or anxiety about the diet. However, if the dreams become particularly disturbing or interfere with your daily life, I would recommend consulting a neurologist. It’s always best to rule out any underlying issues. In the meantime, try to focus on getting a good night's sleep and reducing stress. We’ll see what the blood tests reveal, and that might give us a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A cautious approach is always prudent, and I shall endeavor to prioritize a restful slumber. I confess, the prospect of a neurologist is slightly unsettling. One encounters enough fantastical creatures in one's professional life without having to contemplate the intricacies of the human brain. Though, I suppose even the most imaginative creations require a certain level of… anatomical understanding. No, I believe that concludes my queries for the time being. I appreciate your thoroughness and your pragmatic approach. Thank you for your assistance, Doctor. I shall await the results of the blood tests with… cautious optimism.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jarvis. I'm glad I could help. And don’t worry too much about the neurologist – we’ll cross that bridge if we need to. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Have a good day, and try to avoid any further monochromatic adventures for a while! And if you do happen to create a particularly magnificent griffin, please send me a picture. I’m quite the enthusiast, you see. .
PATIENT: A pleasure doing business with you, Doctor. And I assure you, I shall refrain from any further dietary experiments for the foreseeable future. A griffin, you say? I shall certainly send you a photograph upon its completion. It promises to be a rather spectacular creation. Farewell, Doctor. And thank you once again for your assistance. .
