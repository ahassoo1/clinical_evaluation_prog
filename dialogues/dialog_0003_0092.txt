DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Efficient? Hmph. Good morning to you. I got things to do, you know. What's this about, doc? My throat feels like sandpaper, and my eyes…well, they just ache. Been happening a bit lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, many things can cause that. Sandpaper, you say?
PATIENT: Sandpaper! That’s what it feels like! You don't think I know my own body? Been workin' with traffic lights my whole life, seen a lot, felt a lot. This ain’t normal. It’s…dry. Everything is just dry. You understand “dry”, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Guilds, I understand “dry.” It’s a common descriptor. Now, to be thorough – and I will be – could you elaborate on when this dryness began?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Oh, geez. When did it start…Honestly? Not sure. A while back. Maybe…spring? Or was it summer last year? Everything kinda blends together when you get to be my age, you know? I ain’t got a calendar in my head, doc. I just know it's gettin' worse. It makes talkin' a pain. And I need to yell at the drivers sometimes! They don't pay attention!
DOCTOR: Right. Vague recollections. Very common. And this…yelling is pertinent, I suppose. Do you experience any fever, cough, or congestion with this…dryness?
PATIENT: Fever? Nah. No coughin' or…congesh…whatever that word is. Just…dry. Like the Sahara Desert in my mouth and eyes. And sometimes, I feel kinda…winded, you know? Like I climbed a hill. But I haven’t climbed a hill in…well, a long time. Traffic work ain't exactly mountain climbin'. Is that what you wanted to know? I don't know what a 'congestion' is, exactly. You explainin' this right?
DOCTOR: Winded, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, winded. Like I runnin' a race, but I ain't runnin' no race. Just…short of breath. It happens when I’m walkin', or even just talkin' sometimes. Especially if I gotta yell at those crazy drivers. They don't see the red lights, I tell ya! It's a problem. A real problem. You fixin' to help me, or just askin' questions?
DOCTOR: And how long has this shortness of breath been occurring?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Now that's a tricky one. Probably…a few months, maybe? Like I said, things kinda blend together. It wasn't bad at first, just noticed it a little. But it's gettin' worse, like everything else. You know, I used to be able to walk a whole block without stoppin'. Now…not so much. It's annoying, that's what it is. Very annoying. Is this gettin' somewhere, doc?
DOCTOR: We're getting somewhere. Now, Mr. Guilds, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as heart problems or lung disease?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Lung disease? Never. I'm a strong Cuban man! I worked with traffic lights! That's hard work! Never been sick a day in my life, 'til…well, 'til this dryness and windedness. I get my Medicare checkups, but they just poke and prod and tell me I’m gettin’ old. Which I know! But this ain't just old age, doc. This is somethin' else. Somethin’ wrong. Are you gonna listen to me, or just keep readin' from that…thing?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s move on. Any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. Just the ones the doctor gives me when I go for my checkups. Little white pills. I don’t even know what they are for. He says it's for my…pressure, I think? And somethin' for my…cholesterol. Old man stuff. I don't bother with 'em much, to be honest. Don't feel like they do much good. I got a bottle somewhere, but I can’t remember where I put it. This ain't about pills, doc! This is about feelin’ like a desert!
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? You kiddin' me? I live in Florida! Everything's an allergy here! Pollen, dust, bugs…you name it! I don't pay attention to 'em. You gotta be made of steel to live here. I don't sit around sniffin' and sneezin'. I got work to do. Is this important? Because I'm wastin' my time here askin' about allergies. I want to know what's wrong with my mouth and breath!
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s have a look. If you’ll just step over here… I suppose a brief examination is in order, despite the…lack of clarity.
PATIENT: Examination? Oh, great. More pokin' and proddin'. Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. Just try not to take too long, doc. I got things to do. Real things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound…slightly diminished bilaterally. Not alarming, but notable. Your throat is dry, as you stated. No significant swelling or tenderness. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is elevated. Heart rate is 88, regular. Everything appears…within acceptable limits for someone your age.
PATIENT: Acceptable limits?! You call feelin' like a mummy "acceptable limits"? I’m tellin' ya, somethin's wrong! It's not just my age! Traffic work is hard, alright? Maybe it's the fumes? All those cars, all day long… It’s gotta be somethin’ from the traffic. You gotta look into that! Don't just poke and prod and tell me I'm old! Those cars! They're killin' me, doc, killin' me!
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, while exposure to vehicle exhaust is a valid concern, it’s unlikely to be the sole cause of your symptoms. However, to be thorough, I’ll order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And, given your complaints of shortness of breath, a chest X-ray. We'll rule out any serious underlying conditions. Don’t anticipate anything dramatic. Just routine. I’ll also put in a referral to a pulmonologist. They are specialists in lung conditions. Satisfied?
PATIENT: Pulmonologist? Specialist? Sounds expensive. And expensive means paperwork. Oh, great. More paperwork. You sure this is necessary? Can't you just give me somethin' for the dryness? A lozenge, maybe? Or a cough drop? I don't need a specialist! I need somethin' quick, somethin' easy. And I don't want no paperwork, doc. I'm too old for paperwork. Just…fix my mouth, doc. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concerns about paperwork. However, responsible medical care requires a proper workup. A simple lozenge will not address the underlying cause of your symptoms. I can prescribe a saline nasal spray for the dryness, but that is all I can offer at this time without further investigation. The tests and referral are non-negotiable. And to reiterate, I highly doubt this is related to your occupation.
PATIENT: Non-negotiable, huh? Hmph. Fine. Do what you gotta do. But if this gets expensive, I'm holdin' you responsible. And don't be surprised if I show up at your office with a traffic ticket. I know a few people. Specialists…paperwork…the world is goin' to the dogs. Just get it over with, doc. Just get it over with. And where do I get this nasal spray? Hopefully, it won't cost me a fortune. .
