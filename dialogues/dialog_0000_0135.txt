DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Batara. My ear… it has been leaking some fluid. It started maybe one week ago. Not much at first, but now… more. It is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Leaking fluid, you say. One week, progressively worsening. Hmm. And is it painful?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not a bad pain, but… a dull ache. Especially when I touch it. And sometimes, when I lie down on that side. It feels… full. Like something is inside.
DOCTOR: "Full," you say. Interesting. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Yes. A little muffled, maybe? Not a big change, but sounds are not as clear as before. Like when someone speaks softly, I have to ask them to repeat. My wife… she notices it more than I do. She says I turn the television up too loud.
DOCTOR: Of course she does. And have you experienced any fever, dizziness, or nausea alongside this ear issue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No dizziness. And no… how you say… sickness of the stomach. Just the ear. And the trouble hearing. It is… worrying me, a little. I need to be able to hear well for my job. I teach students.
DOCTOR: Teaching, right. Important to have your hearing. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I did not. I do not know what to do. I tried to clean it with a cloth, but it did not help. I thought… best to come see a professional. I do not want to make it worse. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Radillo, it could be a number of things. It's difficult to say without a proper examination. We'll need to take a look inside your ear, of course. Do you have any allergies to ear drops or any previous ear surgeries or problems?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And no… I have never had surgery on my ears. Never had problems before this. Just… this leaking. It is new. I hope it is nothing serious. It is… distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look. This won't take long. Just sit back and relax. I'm going to gently insert this instrument into your ear to visualize the ear canal and eardrum. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Hmm… yes, I see some fluid in the canal… and the eardrum appears… slightly bulging. There's some redness as well. It looks like otitis media, possibly with a perforation, but we'll need to confirm. I'll need to check your temperature and listen to your lungs to rule out anything else. Do you mind?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need. Temperature and… lungs? Is that to see if it is… spread? I do not understand everything, but I trust you. Do what you need to do. I want to know what is happening. Is it… an infection?
DOCTOR: Yes, checking your lungs is just to be thorough, Mr. Radillo. We want to ensure there isn’t any associated respiratory infection. Your temperature is slightly elevated – 100.4 Fahrenheit. And I am hearing some mild congestion in your lungs. It does appear to be an infection, likely otitis media with a possible tympanic membrane perforation. It’s fairly common, but we need to treat it promptly to prevent complications. I’m going to order a tympanogram to confirm the perforation and assess the extent of the inflammation. It’s a quick, painless test.
PATIENT: A… tympano-what? A test? Is that… will it hurt? And what does this mean? Inflammation? I do not like this. Is it… serious? Will I be able to hear again? I have students to teach, Doctor. I need to hear.
DOCTOR: A tympanogram, Mr. Radillo, is a simple test that measures the movement of your eardrum. It won't hurt at all. It simply involves placing a small probe into your ear. As for the inflammation, it means your ear is swollen and irritated due to the infection. It can be serious if left untreated, leading to hearing loss, but we've caught it early, so I don't anticipate any long-term damage. The good news is it's treatable with antibiotics and possibly some decongestants. I’ll prescribe those for you now. However, with the potential perforation, I'm also going to recommend a referral to an ENT specialist. They can evaluate the perforation and determine if it requires further intervention, such as a tympanoplasty. Do you understand?
PATIENT: ENT… a specialist? Another doctor? A… timpa-what? This is becoming complicated, Doctor. I just want my ear to feel better. I do not want more doctors. I understand… antibiotics. Pills? And… this probe. You will put something in my ear again? I am… worried. Is this very common? Do many people have… holes in their ears? I do not like this. Is it… contagious? Will I give it to my wife?
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, it's understandable to be concerned, but you are overreacting. An ENT specialist, Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor, is simply a doctor who specializes in these types of conditions. They have more specialized equipment and expertise. The probe is a very small instrument, barely noticeable, used to confirm the diagnosis. Yes, it is common to get ear infections, and sometimes they can cause a small perforation. It's often self-healing, but we want to ensure it closes properly. And no, it is not contagious. It is caused by bacteria, not a virus. Here is a prescription for Amoxicillin 500mg three times a day for ten days. And here is a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a very reputable ENT specialist. I'm scheduling a tympanogram for you tomorrow morning to get a clearer picture. I want you to take the antibiotics as directed and follow up with Dr. Sharma within the week. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Tomorrow? Another appointment? So many appointments. And pills three times a day… I forget things, Doctor. I will forget to take the pills. And… Dr. Sharma. Another doctor to explain everything to. Will the pills make me sleepy? I need to be alert for my students. And… how long will this take to get better? A week? Longer? My wife will be very worried. She worries about everything. I just want this to be over. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, you need to prioritize your health. Forgetting medication is not acceptable. Set an alarm on your phone. Ask your wife to remind you. The Amoxicillin may cause mild drowsiness in some patients, but it shouldn’t be significant. As for how long it will take to get better, that depends on the severity of the infection and how well you follow the treatment plan. With the antibiotics and follow-up care, most patients see improvement within a week, but complete resolution may take longer. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Radillo. Please follow my instructions and schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as high fever, severe pain, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Some patients… honestly.
