DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’m here for… a check-up, I believe? Before a surgery. Something about wanting to make sure I’m healthy enough for it. It was my husband who… arranged it, mostly. I don’t recall all the specifics, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-operative assessment. That’s perfectly reasonable. Your husband’s being proactive, which is good. So, you’re scheduled for a surgery… do you happen to know what surgery it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. It was discussed, of course, but everything feels a little… hazy now. Something to do with… appearance? I think it involved… my face? Honestly, Doctor, it’s terribly embarrassing to admit, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s been… a difficult time. Perhaps you have it in your notes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Brightful, it appears you are scheduled for a rhinoplasty – a nose job – on August 15th. And, yes, the notes do indicate some… anxiety regarding the procedure. But before we proceed, it's important I get a full picture of your health. So, let’s start with the basics. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, a rhinoplasty. Yes… that sounds right. It’s… coming back to me a little. As for medical conditions… let me see. I… believe I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, but it cleared up quickly. Nothing chronic, I don’t think. My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments, so I wasn’t usually involved in the details. He was very careful about my health. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since… well, since he passed.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything been scheduled for you in the past?
PATIENT: Scheduled…? Oh, goodness. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, I think. A very long time ago. And… a few dental fillings over the years, of course. But nothing major. No surgeries aside from that, I don't believe. I truly wasn’t one for medical procedures. My husband was the one who… needed regular check-ups. He had a bit of a weak heart, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said your husband handled all of your medical appointments. Did he also handle any… family history information?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh… that's a good point. He did… yes, I believe he had a folder with all that information. He was very organized. I… don’t recall specifics, I’m afraid. I know my mother had… some issues with her joints, arthritis, I think? And my father… he was a very healthy man, as far as I know. He lived to be quite old. But the details… it’s all a bit of a blur, Doctor. Would your office have access to his records perhaps? He used a clinic in the city.
DOCTOR: We can certainly try to access his records, Ms. Brightful, but it often takes time and isn’t always successful. Let’s move on for now. Have you ever had any allergic reactions to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergic reactions… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never knowingly had a severe reaction to anything. I recall a slight rash once, from a lotion maybe? But nothing serious. And I can eat pretty much anything, as far as I know. I do get a little… sniffly during pollen season, but that's just seasonal allergies, I assume. Nothing that requires medication. Is that… a good sign, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's… acceptable. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don't take any medications regularly. I might take a pain reliever for a headache occasionally, but that's it. And I’ve never really been one for vitamins or supplements. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I used to garden, you see. It was a good way to stay active and get fresh air. Though I haven’t had much energy for it lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we get to a physical exam, let's quickly go over your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no, Doctor. Never. I’ve always found smoking quite distasteful. My husband… he tried it briefly when he was younger, but he gave it up quickly. He said it didn't agree with him. We both preferred fresh air and good food. We used to take walks in the park every evening, you see.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Very rarely, Doctor. Just… on special occasions. A glass of wine with dinner perhaps, during the holidays. But I wouldn't say I drink regularly. My husband wasn’t much of a drinker either, so it wasn’t something we did often. It wasn't a habit we ever really cultivated. We preferred a nice cup of tea, usually.
DOCTOR: And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! Doctor, I… I don’t even know where you’re going with these questions. That's… that's quite a thing to ask. I’ve never used any recreational drugs, and I wouldn't dream of it. I assure you. My husband and I lived a very… wholesome life.
DOCTOR: Right. Alright. Well, Ms. Brightful, let's move on to a brief physical exam, then. I’ll just need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and nose, since you're scheduled for a rhinoplasty. If you could just sit up there for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I hope everything is alright. I feel… a little overwhelmed, if I’m being honest. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. Just relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath in… and out. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Take another deep breath… and out. Lungs sound clear, but I do notice you’re breathing a little shallowly. Blood pressure is 130/85. A little on the higher side, but again, not alarming. Now, if you could open your mouth for me… ah. Throat looks normal. No signs of infection or inflammation. Finally, let's take a look at your nose… Your nasal passages are slightly congested, but that’s not uncommon. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, but your blood pressure and heart rate are something we should monitor. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't so bad. Thank you, Doctor. Um… well, you mentioned my blood pressure and heart rate being a little high. Is that… concerning? Should I be worried? I haven’t been feeling particularly stressed lately, but I suppose I have been a little… preoccupied. It’s just… everything has been so different since… I suppose I’m just a little anxious about the surgery, even though I know it's important. Is it alright if we postpone it if I'm not feeling completely up to it?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious about surgery, Ms. Brightful. And a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure can be attributed to that, as well as a general state of… adjustment, as you mentioned. It's not drastically concerning at this moment, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. I recommend a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to get a baseline and ensure everything is functioning properly. We can also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. As for postponing the surgery… that's certainly an option. However, delaying it unnecessarily isn't ideal. It’s best to get these tests done and see what they reveal. If everything comes back normal, we can proceed with the surgery as planned. If there are any concerns, we can address them before moving forward. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Getting the tests done seems like the right thing to do. I just want to make sure I'm… healthy enough for it. And I trust your judgment, of course. When would I be able to schedule those tests? And… how long do you think it will take to get the results? I suppose I should also cancel my other appointments for that day. Hopefully, everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. I can have my nurse schedule those tests for you today. She’ll likely want to do them at the lab across the street. They usually take about an hour, and the results should be back within 48-72 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. I'll also have the nurse send over a list of instructions for the tests – fasting requirements, things like that. As for canceling your appointments, yes, that’s a good idea. It’s best to be prepared. I'll write up a note excusing you for medical testing. In the meantime, try to get some rest and avoid unnecessary stress. I’ll also have my nurse provide you with a list of resources for stress management, just in case. Do you have any further questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very… thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I was a bit of a mess at the beginning, I’m afraid. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for making me feel… less anxious. I feel much better now, knowing we’re taking all the necessary steps. I suppose I’ll let your nurse get the tests scheduled, then. And I’ll try to rest, as you suggested. Thank you again, Doctor Pitmon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It’s my job. And don’t apologize for being a bit flustered – these things happen. Just remember to prioritize your well-being, and we’ll take it one step at a time. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Ms. Brightful.
PATIENT: .
