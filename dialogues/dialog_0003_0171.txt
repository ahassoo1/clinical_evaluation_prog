DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I am Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. It’s...my nails, I think? They just...changed. I don't really know what changed, exactly. They just look…off. Not good. I noticed it a few weeks ago, maybe? I don't keep track of dates. It's a bother, really.
DOCTOR: “Changed” is…not particularly helpful, Ms. Thut. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Okay, okay… they’re… thicker. And the color...it’s not the normal pink. More…yellowish, I guess? And one of them… it’s kinda lifting up. Like it's not stuck on right. Does that make sense? I don't do well with describing things. It's just…weird looking. I used to have nice nails.
DOCTOR: Right. Thicker, yellowish discoloration, and one is lifting. And this has been occurring for…weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Weeks, yeah. A few weeks. I don't know exactly. Time just...goes. I do a lot of things, you know? Not that any of it matters if my nails look awful. It's embarrassing. I try to paint them, but you can still see it under the polish. It's just… not a good look.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, with all due respect, a precise timeline is quite important for a medical evaluation. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with these changes?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Maybe a little…sensitive when I’m typing. I type a lot. But it’s not like… hurting pain. Just…awareness. You know? Like something’s there. I just want them to look normal again. Is that too much to ask? I used to get compliments on my hands.
DOCTOR: Alright. No acute pain, just some sensitivity with typing. Let's move on. Do you have any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: Underlying… what now? Like… a secret illness? No. Not that I know of. I go to the doctor when I need to. I don't just go poking around looking for problems. I have Medicare, you know. They don’t like you wasting their money. I'm healthy enough, I think. I eat…food.
DOCTOR: “Healthy enough” is insufficient, Ms. Thut. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, thyroid issues, or any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Auto…what-now? Look, I don’t remember all those fancy words. I've had… the usual things. Colds, the flu, a bad back once. But nothing serious. The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but I don't take pills. They make me feel funny. I don’t like pills. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. Elevated blood pressure in the past, but currently unmanaged. And no history of autoimmune disease or thyroid problems, as far as you recall. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… dust bunnies, maybe? I don’t like dust. They make me sneeze. And sometimes cats. But that’s not a medical allergy, is it? I haven’t had a really bad reaction to anything…recently. Just the usual sniffles when the seasons change. I used to be allergic to my ex-husband, but that's a different kind of reaction.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, we are discussing medical allergies. Any reactions to medications, foods, or insect stings?
PATIENT: Oh! Right, right. Medical. I... I think I got a rash once from a lotion. A really cheap one. But that was ages ago. And… I don’t eat a lot of…exotic foods. Mostly just normal things. Chicken, potatoes… you know. Nothing fancy. And I don’t go around poking bees, so no stings. Is this a quiz?
DOCTOR: It is a medical consultation, Ms. Thut. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No! I told you, I don't like pills. I really don't. I might take an aspirin if my head really hurts, but that's it. And I don’t believe in all those…supplements. Waste of money, that’s what they are. People just trying to take your money. I try to stay natural, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. No current medications or supplements. Let’s perform a physical examination of your nails, Ms. Thut. Please extend your hands. I observe some thickening and yellowing of multiple nails, particularly on the…right hand. There appears to be onycholysis—separation of the nail plate—on the index finger. And the nail texture is somewhat brittle. I will need to document these findings.
PATIENT: Onycho…what-now? Oh, that one? That's the one that's lifting, right? It's been bothering me. It feels… loose. Like it's going to fall off. I don't want it to fall off! It's embarrassing, you know? What does 'brittle' mean? Are they going to break? I have a garden party next month.
DOCTOR: “Onycholysis” is the separation of the nail from the nail bed, Ms. Thut. And "brittle" means prone to breaking or chipping. As for your garden party… we’ll address that. Based on my preliminary examination, your symptoms are suggestive of a fungal infection—onychomycosis. However, a definitive diagnosis requires a laboratory test—a nail clipping will be sent for analysis. Prepare a fungal culture. We’ll proceed with that now. It's a standard procedure.
PATIENT: A fungus?! Oh, goodness gracious! A fungus on my nails? That sounds…horrible. Like something you get in a dirty basement! Is it contagious? Will I have to throw away all my shoes? And a clipping? You mean… you’re going to cut my nail? That sounds awful! I don't like that at all. Are you sure you need to cut it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, please remain calm. Fungal infections are common, and while unpleasant, they are treatable. It is not indicative of poor hygiene. And no, you will not have to discard your footwear. A small clipping is necessary for accurate identification of the fungal species. It’s a minimal procedure, and quite frankly, essential for determining the appropriate course of treatment. We can, of course, delay the procedure if you prefer to live with the uncertainty. But that is not advisable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But make it quick, please. And gentle. I don’t want you to hurt me. And don't make it look too awful. I have a reputation to uphold, you know? I used to win prizes for my flower arrangements. People expect me to have nice hands. But if it’s really necessary… just… be careful. And tell me exactly what you’re doing, okay? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. I will explain each step as I proceed. We will begin with the affected nail on your index finger. I am carefully removing a small portion of the nail plate to obtain a sample for analysis. It may cause a slight pressure sensation, but should not be painful. There. That is all that is required for now. Send this to the lab for fungal culture and sensitivity. We will await the results, which should be available in approximately two weeks. In the meantime, keep your nails trimmed and dry. We will discuss treatment options once the results are in. Is that satisfactory?
PATIENT: Okay. It didn't hurt...too bad. But it feels...strange now. All empty-feeling. Two weeks? That’s a long time to walk around with a half-a-nail. What kind of treatment are we talking about? Pills again? I really don't want pills. And is it… contagious? Could I give it to my friends at the garden club? Oh dear, this is just dreadful.
DOCTOR: The treatment options include topical antifungal medications – creams or lacquers – or, in more severe cases, oral antifungal medications. We will, of course, explore the topical options first. As for contagion, the risk of transmission is relatively low, but it is advisable to avoid sharing nail clippers or other personal hygiene items. And to practice good hand hygiene. While we await the lab results, I will schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks hence. To discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks... alright. As long as there’s no sharing of… things. And you promise we’ll try the cream first? I really, really don’t want pills. I get enough trouble just remembering to take my vitamins. Okay, a follow-up… fine. But if you tell me I have to take pills, I’m getting a second opinion. You hear me? A second opinion. And could you maybe… write down the cream options? Just in case. And the name of a good second opinion doctor. Just… to be safe.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. I will provide you with a list of topical antifungal medications commonly used for onychomycosis. And a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a dermatologist with excellent credentials. Though, I assure you, we will endeavor to avoid oral medications if at all possible. Here are the lists. With that, I believe we have covered all pertinent details for now. I will see you in two weeks. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of symptoms or have any pressing concerns. Good day, Ms. Thut.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Thank you, I guess. . And I will call if things get worse. Or if you tell me about pills. . Good day.
