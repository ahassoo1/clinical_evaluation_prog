DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Galena, you say? Hmm. Well, honestly, I don't rightly know why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… not wanting me to do something they don't think I should? Honestly, these young people… always telling you what's best. It's my feet, I suppose. They've been bothering me, but bothering isn't enough to let someone poke and prod.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Wynell, it happens. Daughters often worry, and it's good of you to come in anyway. So, your feet are bothering you… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not just my daughter. My ex-husband, God rest his soul, always said I was stubborn. And he wasn't wrong! Anyway… my feet. They ache, mostly. A dull ache, not a sharp pain, thank goodness. And they're…swollen, I suppose. Not terribly, but enough that my shoes don't fit quite right anymore. I used to have such lovely shoes, you know. Now they just sit in the closet. It’s a waste, really.
DOCTOR: A dull ache and some swelling… alright. And this has been happening for… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes, that's a good question. Time just… slips away, doesn't it? It’s been a while, definitely. Months, I reckon. Maybe six? Longer? I honestly couldn't say for sure. It comes and goes, you see. Some days are better than others. I just ignore it when I can. That’s what my mama always did.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ignoring it can sometimes make things harder down the road. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or any particular activity?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… gardening. I love my garden. Tomatoes, peppers, a little bit of everything. But being on my feet all day, weeding and watering… oh, it flares up something awful after that. And walking, if I try to go too far. I used to walk miles, but now… not so much. Everything aches after a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it sounds like activity makes it worse, especially gardening and walking. Do you notice any redness or warmth in your feet?
PATIENT: Redness… hmm. I haven't really looked, to be honest. I'm not one for staring at my feet. Too… practical, I suppose. Warmth… sometimes, maybe? It’s hard to say. I tend to get warm easily, you know? Especially in this weather. It’s been dreadfully hot lately.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your feet?
PATIENT: Injuries? Oh, goodness. Let me think. I tripped over a root in the garden a few years back… twisted my ankle a bit, I think. But nothing serious. I just rubbed some liniment on it and kept going. And… I think I broke a toe once when I was a child, running around barefoot. But that was ages ago! It healed up just fine, as far as I remember. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to these things. A little pain is just part of life, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You’re a remarkably resilient woman, Wynell. Alright. Now, let's talk about other health issues. Do you have any problems with things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Now you're asking things I don't rightly recall. High blood pressure… the doctor did mention something about that, years ago. I think I was supposed to take a pill, but… honestly, I have so many little bottles, it's hard to keep track. Diabetes… I don't think so. I do love my sweet tea, though. Maybe I should cut back. And heart trouble… no, not that I know of. My heart’s just fine, thank you very much. It's just getting tired of all the worrying!
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Well, I take something for my arthritis in my hands. Little white pills. Can’t remember the name of ‘em, though. And sometimes I take ibuprofen when my hands are really bothering me. And that arthritis cream, the one that smells like wintergreen. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I’m not one for taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to finish up the history, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, thank goodness. Except maybe shellfish, I think I had a bit of trouble with that once. But that was a long time ago, and I haven't eaten it since. Mostly, I just try to avoid anything too fancy. Give me a good tomato sandwich any day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. Thank you for that information. Now, would you mind if I took a quick look at your feet?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… that’s what I was afraid of. Look at ‘em? Really? I suppose I can’t stop you. But don't poke too much, dear. They’re sensitive, you know. And I haven't had a pedicure in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: I promise not to poke too much. Just a quick examination to get a better idea of what’s going on. If you’re comfortable, please sit back and I'll take a look. Could you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here goes. There. Happy now? Don't judge them too harshly. They've seen a lot of gardens, you know. And a lot of miles.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look… I see a little swelling, as you mentioned, and some discoloration around the ankles. It doesn’t appear to be acutely inflamed, but there is some tenderness when I press here… and here… . Your pulses feel good – strong and regular. Your skin feels warm to the touch. It appears there's some mild arthritis in both feet, and possibly some early signs of venous insufficiency, which can cause swelling and discoloration. It’s not alarming, but we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Venous… what-now? Insufficiency? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. Arthritis I understand, my mama had that too. But this other thing… is it serious? Will I have to get… shots? I really don’t like needles. And will I have to stop gardening? That would be a tragedy.
DOCTOR: It sounds more complicated than it is, Wynell. Venous insufficiency just means the veins in your legs aren’t quite as efficient at returning blood to your heart as they used to be. It’s common as we get older. And it’s not necessarily serious, but it can cause discomfort and swelling. As for shots, we're not talking about that right now. We'll start with some simple tests to confirm the diagnosis, likely some bloodwork and possibly an ultrasound of your legs. And we definitely don’t want to stop gardening right away. We can discuss ways to manage the swelling and discomfort so you can continue to enjoy your garden. But first, let's get those tests done. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… bloodwork… oh dear. My daughter is going to be thrilled. She's always telling me I need to see a doctor more often. Alright, alright. Tests it is. As long as I don't have to be stuck with a needle too many times. And as long as it doesn't keep me from my tomatoes. What kind of bloodwork are we talking about? And where do I go for these tests? I don’t like going to strange places.
DOCTOR: We'll just need a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and some inflammatory markers to get a better idea of what's going on. It’s a pretty standard blood draw. And the inflammatory markers will help us understand the arthritis better. As for where to go, you can go to the lab right here in the clinic. Mrs. Peterson is the phlebotomist, and she's very good. She'll take good care of you. I’ll send an order over electronically right now, and they'll be expecting you. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild compression stocking to help with the swelling. It can make a big difference, especially when you’re gardening. I also want you to keep an eye on any changes in your feet - any new pain, redness, or sores. And if you notice anything concerning, please call the clinic right away. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Compression… stocking? Oh dear. That sounds… unflattering. But if it helps me keep gardening, I suppose I can try it. As long as it’s not too tight. I can’t stand anything constricting. And I'll try to remember all this… bloodwork, stocking, looking for changes… it’s a lot to keep track of. My daughter is going to be so pleased with herself. She always says I need to be more careful. Alright, alright. I’ll go to the lab. And I'll try to remember everything you said. Just… don't make me wear one of those hospital gowns. I’m too old for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: No hospital gowns, I promise, Wynell. Just the bloodwork. I'll also have the nurse print out a summary of everything we discussed today, including instructions for the bloodwork and information about the compression stocking. It will help you keep track of things, and your daughter will appreciate it too. We'll get those tests done, see what's going on, and make a plan to keep you gardening for many years to come. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you, dear, printing everything out. I do forget things so easily these days. No, I think that’s all for now. Unless… Do you think gardening is bad for my arthritis? I really do love my tomatoes, you know. They just taste better when you grow them yourself. And I'm rather proud of my peppers this year. They're quite fiery.
DOCTOR: Gardening itself isn’t necessarily bad for your arthritis, Wynell. In fact, gentle activity can actually be helpful. But it’s important to be mindful of how you’re doing it. Avoid prolonged bending or kneeling, take frequent breaks, and don’t overdo it. We can talk about some adaptive tools to make it easier on your joints, like a gardening stool or long-handled tools. And the compression stocking can also help reduce swelling and pain while you’re gardening. We'll work together to find ways to keep you enjoying your garden without aggravating your arthritis. Now, I think you’re all set for today. The nurse will come in shortly to get you started with the lab order and print out the summary. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Wynell.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor Galena. You're a kind man, even if you do want me to wear a stocking. I suppose I’ll go see about this bloodwork now. And I'll try not to worry too much. Though my daughter will be expecting me to be a model patient, I’m sure. Thank you for your help, dear. And… try not to let them poke too much at the lab, will you?
DOCTOR: I’ll make a note to tell Mrs. Peterson to be gentle. And don't worry, you've already done the hardest part – coming in to see me. It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Wynell. And please, remember to call if you have any questions. You take care now, and enjoy your tomatoes. .
PATIENT: .
