DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Brege, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It ain’t nothin’ serious, I don’t think, but it’s annoying, ya know? I just wanna get rid of it. Been happenin’ for a couple weeks now, on and off.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fever that’s been coming and going for a couple of weeks. I understand. Annoying is right – it’s good you're getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about the fever itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the evenin’, feels kinda chilly, then I get warm. Not real high, not like I’m shiverin’ or nothin’. Just…warm. Then it goes away by mornin’. Usually. Sometimes it sticks around a little longer. I haven't actually taken my temperature, if that makes a difference. I just feel warm, ya know?
DOCTOR: It does make a difference, but I understand not everyone has a thermometer handy. Feeling warm is a good start. So it's primarily in the evenings, and usually resolves by morning. Anything seem to trigger it, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I've noticed, honestly. I’ve been workin’ pretty regular, seein’ patients, same as always. Nothin’ different there. I mean, sometimes I feel a little achy when it starts, but that could just be from bein’ on my feet all day, ya know? I’m a chiropractor. Gotta bend and twist a lot. Makes things sore sometimes. As for makin' it better… a little rest, maybe? It usually just goes away on its own. I haven't taken nothin' for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regular work as a chiropractor, some aches, and it seems to resolve with rest. No medications taken so far. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fever and aches?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin’ like that. I haven't lost my appetite, and I'm sleepin' okay. Maybe a little tired, but that’s probably just from workin’. I guess I’m just… not feelin’ 100%, but nothin’ major. Just wanna get this fever to stop comin’ back. It's disruptin’ my routine, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Disrupted routine is frustrating. Okay, so no cough, no loss of appetite, sleeping okay, just a little tired. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I'm pretty healthy, actually. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, mumps, chickenpox... but nothin’ serious now. I got high blood pressure a few years back, but it's under control with diet. I try to eat right. And I had a bad back once – that's why I became a chiropractor! Other than that, nothin' much. No diabetes, no heart problems... I'm a simple man, doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear you're generally healthy. High blood pressure controlled with diet – that's excellent. And that back issue makes perfect sense! Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. I’ve been lucky so far. I believe in keepin’ things natural, if ya know what I mean? I try to fix things without cuttin’ or anything like that. That’s why I got into this business. Now, are we gettin’ close to figurin’ out what’s wrong with me, doc? I got patients waitin' this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand you have patients waiting, and we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more questions. No surgeries, that’s good to know. Let’s talk about your family history – any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mom had arthritis when she got older, pretty bad. And my dad, he had heart problems, needed a pacemaker. My brother's got high cholesterol, but that's about it. Not much else. We're a pretty healthy bunch, overall. Listen, doc, is this fever somethin' I should be worried about? I really gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your father, high cholesterol in your brother. I appreciate you sharing that information. It’s good you’re thinking about your family history. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions or over-the-counter medications, even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one thing. I take a multivitamin, every day. Keeps me goin'. And sometimes, when my back’s really botherin’ me, I take ibuprofen. But not regularly. Just when I need it. Otherwise, nothin'. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. And lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can eat anything, take anythin’. I’m pretty lucky, like I said. Are we done now, doc? I really gotta go. This fever better not be somethin' serious…
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, that’s great. Alright, Mr. Brege, thank you for answering all my questions. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. It won't take long. Can you sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, alright? I got a full schedule this afternoon. I carefully sit up on the exam table. Just tell me if it's somethin' I should worry about. I’m not one for long doctor visits.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Just get it over with. I shift a little uncomfortably on the table. Hurry up, doc, I got patients waitin'!
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good airflow on both sides. Okay, your temperature is 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, which is a low-grade fever. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of strep. Alright, Mr. Brege. Everything seems pretty normal on the exam. The red throat is minor and likely related to the fever. Your temperature is slightly elevated. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have a mild viral infection. It's common to get these, especially with the change in weather.
PATIENT: A viral infection? Is that serious? Do I need pills? I told ya I got patients waitin', doc. I can't be out sick. Is there somethin’ I can take to get rid of it fast? I need to get back to work!
DOCTOR: It's not serious, thankfully. Most viral infections resolve on their own within a week or so. No, you don't necessarily need pills. Antibiotics won’t help with a virus, and we want to avoid unnecessary medications. The best thing you can do right now is rest, drink plenty of fluids—water, juice, broth—and manage any discomfort with over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, which you already use for your back. Those will help with the fever and aches. I recommend you monitor your symptoms. If your fever goes above 102 degrees Fahrenheit, if you develop a severe cough, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or if your symptoms worsen significantly, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. But for now, it sounds like you should be okay to return to work, as long as you take it easy and listen to your body. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: So... just rest and drink water? And take ibuprofen if I need it? That’s it? I cross my arms, looking skeptical. Listen, doc, I appreciate you not givin’ me a bunch of pills, but I’m still worried about missin’ work. I got a reputation to uphold, ya know? Patients depend on me. Is there anything else I should be doin’? Anything at all? And can I get a note for work, just in case? It’d be nice to have somethin’ official.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about work, and wanting to maintain your reputation – that’s admirable. And yes, you're right to be proactive. Besides rest and fluids, there isn't much else medically necessary at this point. Since it's a mild viral infection, your body just needs time to recover. Good hygiene is important too - wash your hands frequently to avoid spreading anything. And yes, absolutely. I can write you a note for work stating that you were seen today for a mild viral illness and are advised to take it easy for the next few days. It’ll state that you may experience fatigue and discomfort, and to limit strenuous activity. Here you go. And again, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week, please come back to see me. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay. A note, that’s good. I take the note and glance at it. Yeah, that’ll do. I pause, thinking for a moment. Listen, doc, you’re alright. You didn’t push a bunch of pills on me, and you gave me a note. I appreciate that. I think…I think that’s all. Alright, I gotta get goin’. Patients are waitin’. Thanks, doc. I start to get off the exam table.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brege. I'm glad I could help. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to come back if you need anything else. And thank you for coming in today. Have a good afternoon, and I hope you feel better soon! .
