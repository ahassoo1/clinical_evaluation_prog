DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Lilly. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Bula to you too, I suppose. Well, honestly? I just…thought I’d come in. My daughter kept telling me I should get a check-up, but I feel perfectly fine. Just curious, really. It's not like anything hurts. I don’t usually bother doctors unless something’s broken, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilly. It's good to be proactive, even when you're feeling well – your daughter sounds like a wise woman! A check-up is a great idea. We can just go over everything to make sure things are as they should be. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why your daughter encouraged you to come in?
PATIENT: Oh, she worries too much, that one. Always has. She said I was getting…forgetful. Something about not remembering things. Honestly, I think she just notices every little thing. I remember most things. It’s her that forgets where she put her keys, not me! It’s probably just getting older, right? It happens to everyone.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, and it is common to have some changes in memory as we get older. But it’s always good to check it out, just to be sure. So, when you say “forgetful,” can you give me some examples of what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm…examples? Well, sometimes I go into a room and…what was I going to do? Oh dear. It’s not like I can’t find my way around, it’s just…the reason I went in there escapes me. And names. People's names. Not important ones, usually. Just…acquaintances. You know, the grocery store cashier, that nice lady at church…things like that. It's embarrassing, really. I used to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it sounds like mostly difficulty recalling recent events and names of people you don't see often. And it’s not affecting your ability to navigate or remember important things, like family members?
PATIENT: No, no, family, I remember perfectly. My grandchildren's birthdays, my husband…all that’s fine. It’s just…the little things. It’s not like it’s disrupting my life, you see? Honestly, I think it’s just old age catching up. It happens to everyone, right? You doctors always make a big deal out of things. It’s probably just a normal part of getting older.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Lilly, some memory changes are a normal part of aging. But it's good we're talking about this, because there are also things we can look at to rule out other causes. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That's a long story. I had my gallbladder out years ago, and…something with my blood pressure, I think? It’s been a while. My husband always handled all the doctor's appointments. I just went along and did what I was told. I don’t really pay attention to those details. Honestly, it's all a blur. I suppose I should have been more involved, but… he was very capable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for one partner to take the lead on medical things. We can look through your records here to get a more accurate picture. Okay, it looks like you had your gallbladder removed in 1998, and you were diagnosed with hypertension – high blood pressure – about ten years ago. It’s currently well-controlled with medication, which is good. Do you remember taking any other medications currently, or have you had any other surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, the blood pressure! Yes, that's right. I take a little white pill every morning. Can't remember the name of it, though. And…let me think. No, nothing else. I really don't think so. I haven't been seriously ill in…well, a long time. Maybe a bad cold now and then, but nothing a little rest and some chicken soup couldn't fix. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my vegetables, don't smoke… although, my husband… he was a smoker. That was a terrible habit. But I never touched them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And just to be thorough, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh dear. That's another long story. My mother… she lived to be a very old age, I think. Ninety-something, maybe? And my father… he had something with his heart, I believe. Not sure what exactly. They lived in Korea, you see, and we didn’t talk about those things much. It was… different then. My brother… he was healthy as a horse, always running around. He’s gone now, though. A long time ago. Honestly, I don't remember much detail. It was all so long ago, and so far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. So, a long-lived mother, a father with heart issues, and a healthy brother. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat everything. My daughter always tells me to be careful now, but I’ve never had any problems. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just from spicy food. I love my kimchi, you see. Can’t live without it! Honestly, I think all these doctors just try to scare you about everything. A little spice never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to finish up, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements, besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… My neighbor gave me some… something for my joints. Said it would help with the aches and pains. It’s a little brown pill, I think. I take it sometimes when my knees are bothering me. But honestly, I forget if I actually am taking it today. I have so many little bottles around the house. My daughter keeps telling me to organize them, but… I just don't have the energy for all that. It’s probably nothing important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a brown pill for joint pain, taken occasionally. That’s helpful to know. Now, Lilly, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. If you think it's necessary. I suppose it can't hurt. Just don't poke around too much, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be. And don't be surprised if I ask a lot of questions. I just like to know what's going on, you see? It’s a habit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilly. We’ll take it slow and easy, and I’ll explain everything as we go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… Good. Your heart rate is regular and a little elevated, around 88 beats per minute. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Next, I’ll check your blood pressure again to confirm it’s well-controlled. 142/88. A little higher than we’d like, but not dangerously so. Now, let’s just take a look at your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common with age. I'm also going to check your gait and balance. Walk slowly, if you will... Okay. It's just to see how you are moving. Finally, I’ll just do a quick cognitive assessment, a few simple questions to check your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. More tests, more tests. I suppose it's better to be thorough. My gait? What does that even mean? I walk like everyone else, I think. It’s just… getting older, that’s all. And a cognitive assessment? What are you trying to find out? Are you thinking I'm losing my mind? Honestly, I feel perfectly… adequate. But fine, go ahead. Ask your questions. But don't expect a genius answer. It’s been a long day already.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lilly. "Gait" just means the way you walk. And a cognitive assessment is just a simple way to check your memory and thinking skills – it doesn't mean I think you're losing your mind at all. It's a routine part of a check-up, especially when we're talking about memory concerns. Let's start with something easy. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The year? Let me think… Is it… 2023? No, that can’t be right. My daughter said something about… 2025, is it? Yes, I think it’s 2025. But honestly, they all blur together after a while. I don’t pay much attention to the dates, you see. Too many birthdays and anniversaries to keep track of. Is this going to be a test on history now?
DOCTOR: Okay, 2025 is correct. Good. Now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The President? Honestly, I can never remember those names. They come and go so quickly. Is it… Biden? Yes, I think it’s Biden. But don’t ask me what he's done, because I haven’t the slightest idea. I just try to stay out of politics, you see. It's too stressful. Honestly, I probably should be more informed, but… my daughter watches the news. She’ll tell me if anything important happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly. Now I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Please try to remember them, as I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Is this some kind of trick? What are you trying to prove? Honestly, I can remember three words perfectly fine. It’s just… other things I forget. Like where I put my keys. And what I went into the kitchen for. But three words? Easy. Apple, table, penny. Now, can we get on with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you tell me what month it is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What month is it? Is it… September? No, that’s when the leaves change. Is it… July? No, that was too hot. Honestly, they all feel the same after a while. August! Yes, I think it's August. My grandson's birthday is this month, I believe. But honestly, I could be wrong. My daughter keeps a calendar. She knows all these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly. Now I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing all the numbers, and set the time to ten past eleven. I have a piece of paper and a pen here for you. Don’t worry about being perfect, just do your best. This will just help me get a better understanding of your spatial reasoning and cognitive function.
PATIENT: There. It's not a masterpiece, but it tells the time, doesn't it? Honestly, I haven't drawn a clock since elementary school. You doctors ask the strangest questions. I suppose it's good to be thorough, but… it's a bit undignified, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilly. That’s helpful. Okay, now let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Hmm… apple… I remember that one. And… table? Yes, I think so. But the third one… Oh dear. It’s on the tip of my tongue… It was something… small… and round… No, I can’t quite recall it. Was it… orange? No, that’s a fruit. I just… can’t remember. It’s terribly frustrating. Honestly, it's a perfectly good memory, I’m sure of it. It just… slipped away. It's probably just a temporary lapse, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilly. The third word was penny. It’s alright that you didn’t recall it right away. Based on the questions I asked and the physical exam, you’re experiencing some mild cognitive impairment, specifically with short-term memory and recall. The clock drawing test also showed some slight difficulties with spatial reasoning. It’s important to understand this doesn't necessarily mean you have dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. There are many possible causes for cognitive changes, including stress, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or even normal aging. I recommend we order some blood tests to check for any underlying medical conditions or vitamin deficiencies. We can also discuss a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Oh, dear. More doctors? Honestly, I just came in for a check-up, not to be poked and prodded by a whole team of specialists. I feel perfectly… functional. I can still cook, I can still clean, I can still manage my own affairs. A little forgetfulness is just part of getting older, isn’t it? Blood tests, alright. I suppose that’s not too terrible. But I don’t want any unnecessary tests, and I certainly don’t want to be sent to a specialist unless it’s absolutely necessary. And please, don’t start talking about… those diseases. I don’t want to hear about dementia or Alzheimer’s. It's just a little forgetfulness, I tell you. My daughter worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilly. I completely respect your wishes, and I won’t push you to undergo any tests or referrals you’re not comfortable with. We can start with the blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. If the results are normal, and your symptoms don’t worsen, we can monitor your condition and reassess as needed. The goal is to ensure your health and well-being, and we’ll work together to achieve that. I'll write a lab order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good baseline. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood anytime. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Alright, blood tests. As long as it's not too much trouble. And please, tell the lab technician not to poke around too much. My veins aren’t what they used to be. Vitamin B12 and… what did you say? The thyroid? Honestly, all these medical terms are just confusing. Is there a reason you’re testing for those things? Are you implying I have some kind of deficiency? And please, no scary results. I just want to go home and relax. This has been a very stressful day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilly. We test for vitamin B12 and thyroid levels because deficiencies in these nutrients can sometimes cause cognitive changes, such as memory problems and difficulty concentrating. It doesn't mean you necessarily have a deficiency, but it's important to rule them out as a potential cause. I'll make a note on the lab order to ask the technician to be gentle. And don't worry, we'll discuss the results thoroughly when they come back, and I'll explain everything in plain language. After the blood tests, I'll also send you home with some information about brain health and strategies to improve memory. Things like staying mentally active, getting regular exercise, and eating a healthy diet can all be beneficial. Do you have any questions about any of that, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: Alright, brain health… exercise… healthy diet. My daughter tells me the same things. Honestly, I try to stay active, but it's hard when my knees are bothering me. And I eat my vegetables, even if I don't always enjoy them. No, I don’t think so. I think that’s all I need to know for now. Just… please, no unnecessary tests or referrals. And no scary results. I suppose I should go get the blood tests done. Where is the lab, exactly? And can you write down the name of those vitamins and… that thyroid thing? Just in case I want to look them up later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilly. I'll write down the names of the tests for you. It’s a Complete Blood Count , Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone . The lab is just down the hallway to your left. The technician’s name is Maria, and she's very gentle. She’ll take care of you. I’ll call you with the results once they come back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Alright, Maria… gentle… good. I hope so. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I should be going now. I have a lunch date with my daughter. She'll want to know how it went. And please, remember… no scary results.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilly. You have a good lunch with your daughter. And I'll do my best to ensure we get some clear answers. .
