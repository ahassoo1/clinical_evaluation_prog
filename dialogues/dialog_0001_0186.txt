DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, let’s get this over with. You're 62, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Sixty-two. Look, I got a tryout later, so if we could kinda…speed things up, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: A tryout?
PATIENT: Yeah. For the…uh…the Silver Steppers. It’s a senior…dancing team. Don't look so surprised! It keeps a man young. Point is, I need to be in good enough shape to, you know, not pull a muscle.
DOCTOR: Dancing. Right. And what brings you to my office, needing a medical assessment for dancing?
PATIENT: Well, they require a check-up before you join. Just to be sure, you know? Old bones and all that. They want to make sure I’m not gonna collapse on the floor or somethin’. Honestly, it feels a little silly, but rules are rules.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's just run through the basics so I can get this done. Any complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Not really. Little aches and pains here and there, like you’d expect at my age, but nothing I can’t work through. Knees sometimes feel a bit stiff in the mornings, but that’s about it. No major illnesses or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, stiff knees. And anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… oh! Sometimes my breathing gets a little short if I’m really pushing it, like when we're learning a fast routine. But it passes quickly. Usually just gotta catch my breath for a minute.
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, just when I'm exerting myself. Look, I'm not training for the Olympics here, it's just dancing! Mostly just a lot of… vigorous stepping. It hasn't stopped me from doing anything yet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a basic physical exam done. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your range of motion. Then we can…move on.
PATIENT: Sounds good. Whatever gets this over with faster. Let’s just…get it done.
DOCTOR: Have a seat. Shirt off, please. Don’t tell me you’re shy.
PATIENT: Look, I’m sixty-two, not a teenager. Just try to be quick about it, alright? It’s a bit chilly in here.
DOCTOR: Heart rate’s a little elevated, but that could be from walking up the stairs. Lungs… A little wheezing, but nothing alarming. Some crepitus in the knees. Not unexpected. Range of motion is… limited. Can you bend your knees all the way?
PATIENT: Ugh, not really. It’s… tight. It feels like somethin' is blockin' it. Not a sharp pain, just…stiff. Like a rusty hinge. I can get most of the way, but not all the way down. See? It’s not easy at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited range of motion, some crepitus. History of intermittent shortness of breath. I'm going to order some x-rays of your knees and a basic blood panel just to rule out anything serious. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: X-rays? Blood panel? For dancing? Look, I appreciate you bein' thorough, but... isn't that a bit much? As for allergies, no, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. This is getting complicated.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, Mr. Kingan. Just covering my bases. We need a baseline. Blood work will check for inflammation, and the x-rays will show us the state of your knee joints. I’ll have the receptionist schedule those for you. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Nope. No insurance. Look, I’m a little worried about the cost now. I really just needed a quick sign-off so I could try out. Is there any way to just…skip the tests? I'll sign a waiver or somethin'. I'm responsible for my own health, honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I am a doctor. I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on a physical exam without basic investigations, especially given your symptoms and age. No insurance means you’ll have to pay out of pocket, yes. But that’s your responsibility. I'm not going to compromise patient safety just so you can join a…dancing team. I can give you a list of affordable imaging centers. Do you want that?
PATIENT: Affordable imaging centers… Great. Fine. Alright, look, just give me the list. And tell me how much I’m lookin’ at, roughly, for all this. I need to know if it’s even worth it at this point. This is turning into a whole thing. Honestly……dancing team. .
DOCTOR: X-rays will be roughly $200 to $300, depending on the center. Blood panel, another $100 to $200. Those are estimates, of course. Once I have the results, we can discuss a plan. I suggest physical therapy, regardless of the results, to strengthen your knees. And perhaps reconsider the… vigorous stepping. .
