DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Terasa! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, bula to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit hard to explain. My hearing’s been going funny. Like, it just… disappears sometimes. And I get really dizzy with it. It’s been happening on and off for a little while now, I think. My daughter, Lani, she’s the one who really pushed me to come in. She worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning, and I’m glad Lani encouraged you to come in. It’s good to have someone looking out for you. So, the hearing disappearing and the dizziness – do they happen at the same time, or separately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Lani is a good girl. Always has been. Um… mostly together, I think. The dizziness comes with the hearing loss. It’s a spinning feeling, like I've had too much kava, but I haven’t had any! It doesn’t last long, thankfully. Maybe a few minutes… sometimes longer? It's all a bit… fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few minutes to sometimes longer with a spinning sensation and hearing loss – that helps. And it feels like the dizziness is similar to what you’d experience after kava, but without actually having any?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Like… a woozy feeling, you know? And it's not just the spinning. Everything seems… off. Hard to describe. And then my ears will ring sometimes, before it all goes quiet. My husband… he used to get ringing in his ears too. It runs in the family, I think. He’s… gone now, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite unsettling. And the ringing you're experiencing beforehand – is that a constant ringing, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Not always there. More often before one of the spells, like I said. It’s a high-pitched sound… like a mosquito buzzing, maybe? It's not loud, but annoying. It’s just… another thing. Everything feels a bit… broken lately, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Terasa. It sounds like a lot to deal with. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes – certain movements, stress, anything like that?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly? Not really. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m resting, sometimes when I’m… well, just doing things. I was hanging laundry last week when it hit me. Another time I was at the market, picking out mangoes. Nothing special either time. I haven't been overly stressed, not more than usual anyway. Life is… life, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand. Okay, so no obvious triggers. And have you had any other symptoms along with the hearing loss, dizziness, and ringing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my head feels a bit… full, like pressure in my ears. Not a headache, exactly. Just… stuffy. And I get a little bit nauseous with the dizziness, but I haven’t actually been sick. Small things, really. Nothing major. I don't want to bother you with everything.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Terasa. These details are very helpful. Pressure in the ears and a little nausea with the dizziness – that’s good to know. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I have my blood pressure, the doctor told me it goes up sometimes. But I try to watch my salt. And I had a little bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but it’s mostly okay now. Nothing else, I don’t think. I’ve been to the doctor a few times, you know, regular check-ups. But nothing serious ever came of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and some past knee trouble. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… yes, I take a little white pill for the blood pressure. Every morning. Lani makes sure I don’t forget. I can’t remember the name of it, though. It’s… small and round. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small, round white pill for blood pressure and a vitamin D supplement. We can look up the name of the blood pressure medication in your records. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Not that I remember, no. Not any major ones, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long time ago. That’s about it. Nothing since then. I’m not a fan of hospitals, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child. And any family history of hearing problems, dizziness, or balance issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s what Lani was worried about. My mother, she had terrible dizziness when she got older. She fell a few times. And my brother, he had problems with his ears his whole life. Always getting infections. And like I said, my husband had the ringing in his ears. So, yes, it runs in the family, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. Now, let's quickly go over allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. I eat everything Lani puts in front of me! I've never had a bad reaction to anything. No, I don't think so. I’m very lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. Now, Terasa, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your ears, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few balance tests. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I suppose it has to be done. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, I'm just going to take a quick look inside your ears. They look a little bit red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Oh dear… I’m not very good at this, am I? Everything’s spinning a little bit. I feel a bit unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That's alright, it's a common reaction. It shows some balance issue. And now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’m trying, Doctor. It’s a bit hard, everything feels… shaky. I hope I’m not making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: You’re not making a mess of things at all. This is all helpful information. Okay, Terasa, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called Vestibular Neuritis or possibly Ménière’s Disease. Both can cause episodes of dizziness, hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. Your family history also makes this more likely. However, we need to rule out other causes. I'm going to order a hearing test and a balance test to get a clearer picture. I’d also like to check your blood pressure to see if that’s contributing to the problem. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… those are big words, Doctor! Vestibular… whatever it was and… Ménière’s. It sounds serious. But if you think it’s important, then yes, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Hearing test and balance test… and check my blood pressure. Yes, that sounds alright. Just… please explain everything to me afterwards, alright? I don’t want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Terasa. I will explain everything to you thoroughly, and we will go through the results together. We won’t do anything without discussing it first. The hearing test and balance tests are painless and will help us understand what’s going on with your inner ear. We'll get those scheduled for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help with the nausea and dizziness. It's called Meclizine. It won't cure the problem, but it should help you feel a bit more comfortable during an episode. And I recommend avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and salty foods, as these can sometimes worsen the symptoms. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Meclizine… to help with the sick feeling. And no coffee, no grog, no salt. I can do that, I think. Lani will be happy to hear that, she always tells me to watch my salt anyway. So, you’ll schedule the tests for me? And then we’ll talk about everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. My nurse, Sisi, will schedule those tests for you before you leave today. She’ll also give you a prescription for the Meclizine. I want you to know, Terasa, that these conditions are often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. We’ll work together to figure out the best plan for you. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… not right now, I think. I’m a bit overwhelmed with all the big words and everything. I suppose I’ll wait to see the results of the tests before I ask too many questions. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. Sisi will also give you a number to reach me directly if needed. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. Vinaka vakalevu, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Vinaka vakalevu to you too, Doctor. I’ll try. I think I’ll go home and have a nice cup of chamomile tea. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Terasa. Take care, and we’ll see you soon. Sisi will be right with you to schedule those tests. .
