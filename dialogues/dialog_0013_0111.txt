DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Drahota, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Frankly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… my skin. It’s gotten darker. And I tire easily. It’s… troubling. I’ve been working, of course. Always working. Reinforcing iron, you understand. A respectable trade. But this… this isn’t normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darker skin and increased fatigue – those are definitely things we should look into. And you mentioned you work with iron, reinforcing it?
PATIENT: Yes, reinforcing iron. It's hardly a secret, Doctor. It's physical labor. Heavy lifting. Been doing it for… well, a long time. Longer than you’ve been alive, I suspect. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply stating the obvious?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely, Mr. Drahota. You're right to want to get straight to the point. We are getting somewhere. And I apologize if my questions seemed basic—I just want to get a complete picture. So, this darkening of the skin… has it been gradual, or did it happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. It’s… difficult to say precisely. Time blurs, you understand. I haven’t been keeping a detailed log of my pigmentation, Doctor. It just… became more noticeable. And the tiredness… it used to be a good tiredness, after a hard day's work. Now it’s… draining. Like something is taking my energy. Honestly, I don’t know what details you expect from me. It’s skin and fatigue. Is that not enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Draining" fatigue and gradual skin darkening. Let's try to pinpoint a few more details, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Weight? Good heavens, Doctor. I eat when I’m hungry. And my weight… fluctuates. What does that have to do with dark skin? I assure you, I maintain a perfectly respectable physique for a man of my age and profession. It’s not as though I’ve suddenly lost a limb. This line of questioning is… unproductive.
DOCTOR: You’re right to push back, Mr. Drahota. I apologize if I'm being frustrating. Changes in appetite and weight can be related to underlying conditions that also cause skin changes and fatigue, so I'm just trying to rule things out. Okay, let's try a different approach. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… My wife nags, if that counts. But I believe that is a constant, not a symptom. No… I feel a little warmer than usual, perhaps. A bit of a flush, sometimes. But that could be the heat. This summer has been dreadful. Really, Doctor, I'm a working man. I don't have time for ailments. I need to know if this is serious, or if I can simply get back to my work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit warmer than usual, and a flush. That's helpful. And I understand you're a busy man, and want to get back to work as soon as possible. We will try to figure this out quickly. Just a few more questions, if you'll indulge me. Do you have any history of liver problems or anemia?
PATIENT: Liver problems? Anemia? Goodness gracious. Are you implying something, Doctor? I've lived a respectable life! I do not spend my evenings indulging in… vices. And I’ve never had a blood test in my life, so how would I know about anemia? My wife handles the medical matters. Ask her. This is preposterous. I simply have darker skin and am tired. Is that so hard to comprehend? Perhaps I should just go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration. I apologize for the line of questioning. It’s not my intention to imply anything. I’m simply gathering information to understand what might be causing these changes. Let’s put that aside for now. Let me quickly review your chart… I see you haven’t had a recent physical exam. And there’s no record of blood work. Given your symptoms—the darker skin, fatigue, and the feeling of being warmer—and to rule out some potential causes, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Fine. Do whatever you deem necessary. But I expect a quick turnaround. I have work to do. And please, tell me the results plainly. I don't need medical jargon. Just tell me if it's serious or not. And if it isn't, I'd like to be on my way. This is a waste of my time, frankly. But… alright. Blood tests. Just… make it quick. .
DOCTOR: Alright, I've ordered a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a liver function test. The lab is just down the hall. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. It will take a few days to get the results back, but I'll have my assistant call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—like shortness of breath, dizziness, or significant weakness—please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
