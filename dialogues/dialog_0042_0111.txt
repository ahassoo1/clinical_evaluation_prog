DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s darkened. And I’m terribly fatigued, constantly. My wife insisted I come, said I was looking… unwell. Though, frankly, I feel perfectly capable. I’ve worked with iron my entire life, you know. It shouldn’t be anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about changes to your skin and experiencing fatigue. And it's good that your wife encouraged you to come in; it's always wise to get things checked out. You mentioned working with iron – that’s helpful information. When you say your skin has darkened, can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s… all over, I suppose. Not in patches. Just… a general… dullness. And a bit… brownish, perhaps. It’s difficult to say precisely. I don’t spend much time examining myself. I’m a practical man. It’s been… gradual, I think. Though, time seems to slip away these days, doesn’t it? I can't give you specifics. It's just… not the color it used to be. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Drahota. A general dullness and brownish discoloration all over, developing gradually. Thank you for clarifying. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… weariness. A lack of… pep. I used to be able to work all day, come home and still tend to the garden. Now? I need a nap in the afternoon. And sometimes even then… it doesn’t help much. It's a persistent drag, you see. Not debilitating, mind you. Just… inconvenient. I don’t understand why I need to explain this. A man works hard, he gets tired. It’s simple logic.
DOCTOR: It is simple logic, Mr. Drahota, and you're right to want to understand what's going on. Even seemingly simple things deserve investigation, especially when there's a change from your usual state of health. Now, let's go through some more details to get a better picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and skin changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Good heavens, Doctor, are you suggesting something is wrong with me? I assure you, I'm quite healthy for my age. Let me think… No. Nothing specific comes to mind. Perhaps a bit of indigestion sometimes, but that's hardly worth mentioning. Old age comes with its… peculiarities. Really, I think my wife is making a fuss over nothing. I'd rather not waste any more of your time, or my own, with trivialities.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Drahota, and I certainly wasn’t implying anything is definitively wrong. It's simply my job to gather as much information as possible to ensure we're considering all possibilities. Even seemingly minor details can be important. Alright. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? I eat when my wife puts food in front of me, naturally. Weight? I haven't stepped on a scale in decades. Why would I? I feel perfectly… substantial. Honestly, these questions are rather… undignified. Is this standard procedure? I'm a practical man, Doctor. I build things. I don't concern myself with frivolous measurements. I'm starting to feel rather… inconvenienced by this entire process. Perhaps I should just leave.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem undignified, Mr. Drahota. You're right, they might seem unnecessary, but they help me get a complete picture. I assure you, I'm not trying to cause any inconvenience. Let's move on. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. My legs are as solid as… well, as iron beams, naturally. I walk perfectly well, thank you very much. I’ve always been a strong man. A bit of… stiffness in the mornings, perhaps. But swelling? Absolutely not. I've spent my life on my feet, Doctor. I assure you, my circulation is quite robust. Frankly, I'm starting to suspect this is simply a waste of both our times. Is there anything concrete you can tell me, or are we simply going to continue this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. Perhaps a brief physical exam would be helpful. It would allow me to assess your overall health and potentially identify any physical signs related to your fatigue and skin changes. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But make it quick, Doctor. I have… commitments. And don't expect miracles. I'm a perfectly functional man, despite what my wife may tell you. Just… get it over with. Though I must warn you, I’m rather sensitive to cold stethoscopes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. And I’ll warm the stethoscope first. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. And I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lungs when I listen with the stethoscope. Your abdomen is soft, but a little distended. And I’m feeling some mild swelling in your ankles. As you mentioned, your skin does appear generalized dull and brownish. I don't see any lesions or areas of inflammation. Okay, Mr. Drahota. I’d like to order some blood work. This will help me assess your overall health, check for any underlying infections, and evaluate for potential causes of fatigue and skin changes. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and an iron panel. Also, let’s get a chest X-ray to evaluate those crackles in your lungs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work? A chest X-ray? Good heavens, Doctor, this is becoming quite the ordeal. I came in for a darkened complexion and a bit of tiredness, not a full medical investigation! My wife will be pleased. Though, frankly, I find this entire process rather… insulting. Fine. Do whatever tests you deem necessary. But I expect results quickly. I haven’t got all day to spend in a doctor’s office. And if it turns out to be nothing serious, I expect a full apology. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to leave. </stage>
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, I'm not trying to cause any inconvenience, and I’ll expedite the tests as much as possible. We’ll get the results to you as soon as they're available, and we can discuss them thoroughly. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood before you leave, and we’ll schedule you for a chest X-ray at the imaging center nearby. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Drahota. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
