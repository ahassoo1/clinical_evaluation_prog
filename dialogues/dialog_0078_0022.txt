DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, my tummy feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much these days. Not like I used to. It’s just… not feeling right. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. Everything is a little… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I see. Your tummy feels bigger than usual, and you've noticed a decrease in your appetite. And you mentioned it’s been happening for a while now, but you’re having some trouble recalling exactly when it started. That’s perfectly alright, we'll try to piece things together. Could you describe what you mean by "not feeling right"?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Not feeling right… it’s… hard to say. Not pain, exactly. More like… full? Even when I haven’t eaten much. And sometimes… a little uncomfortable. Like something is… pressing. But not hurt. Do you understand? It's just... strange. I used to be so good at explaining things when I was a sociologist... but the words don't come so easy now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand. Fullness even with a small amount of food, and a general discomfort, like pressure. It sounds quite bothersome. Don't worry about explaining things perfectly; we’ll get there. You were a sociologist—that tells me you're good at observing and describing, and that’s what’s important now. Has this feeling of fullness or pressure changed at all since it started?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… changed. Hmm… I think it's gotten… more. More often, I feel it. And maybe… bigger? The tummy, I mean. It feels bigger more of the time now. It used to be just sometimes, after I ate… well, I don't even remember what I ate! It’s all so mixed up. I used to be so sharp, remembering everything. Now… not so much. Do you think… is it something bad? I get worried sometimes.
DOCTOR: It sounds like the fullness and pressure have become more frequent and noticeable over time, and you're understandably concerned about what might be causing it. It's good that you're paying attention to these changes. Let’s try to get a little more information. Besides the fullness and pressure, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm… let me think. Well… I get tired easier these days. Much easier. Used to be, I could walk for hours! Now, just a little bit and I need to sit. And… maybe a little bit of trouble… going to the bathroom. Not every time, but sometimes it’s harder. Oh, and I haven't been sleeping very well. Lots of waking up in the night. Does that… does that make sense? I'm sorry if I'm rambling. It's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Soila. You're giving me very helpful information. Fatigue, some difficulty with bowel movements, and trouble sleeping—those are all important things to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… a long time ago. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, I don't even remember! Years and years. I used to be so healthy, though. I walked everywhere, ate good food… not too much of anything bad. I don’t think I have any serious problems. Maybe… high blood pressure, a long time ago? The doctor said something about it, but I stopped taking the pills. They made me feel funny. I don’t remember much else. I'm sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s all… gone. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. We’ll work with what you remember. It’s helpful to know you were generally healthy and that you were previously treated for high blood pressure, even if you stopped taking the medication due to side effects. We'll need to check your blood pressure today to see where it stands. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me think very hard. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago. And… I think I was in the hospital once, when I broke my arm. I was playing with my friends, and I fell. But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Everything is just… a blur. I don’t think I’ve had any other surgeries or been in the hospital. But… I could be wrong. It’s hard to be sure. I'm so sorry for being such a bother. I wish I could remember things better.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Soila. It’s perfectly understandable that memories fade over time. Knowing about your tonsillectomy and broken arm is helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s… tricky. My family… well, they lived in Russia, a long, long time ago. I don’t know much about their health. My mother… I think she had something with her heart, but I don’t remember the details. And my father… he was a strong man, but he died young. I don’t know what he died of. We didn’t talk much about those things back then. It wasn’t considered polite. I’m sorry, I wish I could tell you more. Everything is… lost in the past. It’s just… gone. Do you think it’s important?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. It's common for family medical history to be difficult to recall, especially if family members lived far away or weren’t open about health issues. Knowing that your mother had a heart condition and that your father passed away young is helpful, even if we don't have specific details. Let’s move on to some current information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… let me think very hard. I don’t think I have any allergies. I’ve eaten everything over the years! I used to love pickles and herring… and lots of other things. I haven’t had any trouble with food. And medications… I haven’t taken many medications. I used to try to avoid them if I could. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… maybe? It’s hard to be sure. I haven’t had any serious reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. Do you think it’s important? I’m sorry for being so vague. It’s just… everything is so fuzzy.
DOCTOR: No allergies reported, that’s good to know. And don't worry about being vague, Soila. We're just trying to gather as much information as possible. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no. I don't take any medications now. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a long time ago, like I said. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. And I don’t take any vitamins or supplements. I used to try to get everything I needed from my food. I don't really believe in all those fancy things. I just eat what I like, when I feel hungry. And I don’t take anything for sleeping or anything like that. I just try to rest when I’m tired. I hope that’s alright. Do you think I should be taking something?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good to know you're not currently taking any medications. We'll discuss whether any medications might be helpful later on, based on our examination and any further tests. Now, let’s move on to a physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. A physical exam… that’s alright. I don’t mind. I used to be very active, so I’m used to being poked and prodded. Just tell me what you need me to do. I hope I don't disappoint you. I'm not as spry as I used to be. Just be gentle, if you don't mind. And tell me if anything hurts, so I can let you know. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Soila. We'll take things slowly and gently. I'll let you know what I'm doing every step of the way. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – that includes your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look at your abdomen. This cuff will inflate around your arm for a moment. It might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't be painful. Just relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 160 over 95. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are a little shallow. Now, let's examine your abdomen. Could you lie back on the exam table for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. 160 over 95… that sounds high, doesn't it? I knew I shouldn’t have stopped taking those pills. My doctor warned me, but I didn't listen. I always thought I was healthy enough without them. Yes, I'm lying down now. It's a little hard to get comfortable these days. My bones aren't as strong as they used to be. Just tell me what you need me to do, and I’ll try my best. Be gentle, please. And tell me if anything hurts. I’m ready when you are. I hope my tummy isn’t too… problematic. It’s been acting up lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I'm noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, and it feels a little… distended. It's not sharply painful, but it's definitely more firm than it should be. There’s no rebound tenderness, which is good. I don't feel any masses, but it’s a little difficult to assess fully due to the distention. Given your symptoms of fullness, pressure, decreased appetite, and fatigue, combined with the elevated blood pressure and abdominal distention, I think it would be helpful to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood tests and a CT scan? That sounds… serious, doesn’t it? I haven’t had any tests like that before. I always tried to avoid doctors as much as possible. Is it really necessary? I mean, I just feel a little… unwell. Could it be something simple? Maybe I just need to rest more? I don’t know… I’m a little scared, to be honest. I don’t like the sound of those tests. What are you looking for? Is it something bad? I just want to feel better, that’s all. I don’t want any complicated procedures or anything. Could we try something else first? Maybe some medicine? I just want to go home and rest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It is a little unsettling to think about tests, and you're right to want to explore less invasive options first. However, given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, these tests will help us determine the cause of your discomfort and rule out anything serious. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health, including your kidney and liver function, and check for any signs of infection. The CT scan will allow us to get a more detailed look at your abdomen to see what's causing the distention and tenderness. I'm not trying to scare you, Soila, but it’s important to be thorough. If it turns out to be something simple, that’s great! But if it's something more serious, the sooner we diagnose it, the sooner we can start treatment. We can discuss the risks and benefits of each test in more detail, and I will be with you every step of the way. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary… I guess I’ll agree to the tests. But please explain everything very carefully. I don’t understand all the medical terms. And I’m a little worried about the CT scan. Is it safe? Will it hurt? I don't want to be exposed to anything dangerous. And what about the blood tests? Will they take a lot of blood? I don’t like needles. I always faint when I see them. Just please be gentle with me. And tell me everything you’re doing before you do it. I just want to feel better, that’s all. And I want to go home as soon as possible. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Soila. That's not too much to ask at all. We'll take things at your pace, and I'll explain everything very carefully before we do it. It's important you feel comfortable and informed. Let's start with the CT scan. It uses X-rays to create detailed images of your abdomen. It’s painless, but you will need to lie still on a table for about 20-30 minutes. We might give you some contrast dye intravenously to help the images be clearer, but it's generally safe. Some people experience a warm sensation when the dye is administered, and rarely, some people have a mild allergic reaction. We'll monitor you closely throughout the procedure. As for the blood tests, we'll only take a small amount of blood—usually a few vials. I understand your fear of needles, and we can take some precautions to make it easier for you. We can have a phlebotomist who is experienced with anxious patients draw the blood, and we can have you lie down during the procedure to prevent you from feeling faint. We can also use a numbing cream to minimize any discomfort. I will be with you every step of the way, Soila. We'll take breaks if you need them, and we can stop at any time if you're feeling overwhelmed. Would you like me to explain the specific blood tests we're ordering?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds a little better, knowing you’ll be there with me. And the numbing cream… that would be very helpful. I always get so nervous around needles. It’s silly, I know, but I can’t help it. Yes, please explain the blood tests. What are you looking for? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what’s going on inside my tummy. And I want to feel better soon. Is there anything I can do to prepare for the tests? Should I fast? Should I stop taking any medications? Just tell me everything I need to know. I’m ready when you are. But please be gentle with me. I’m an old woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I understand your anxiety, and I will be as gentle as possible. Let's go over the blood tests and how to prepare. We're ordering a complete blood count, which will give us information about your red and white blood cells and platelets. We're also ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel, which will assess your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. We'll also check your thyroid function and a few other markers to get a complete picture of your health. As for preparation, yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks except for water. You can continue to take your usual medications unless I specifically tell you otherwise. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them with you and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the tests or the preparation process?
PATIENT: Oh… 8 hours of fasting. That sounds… difficult. I always get so hungry. But I guess I can manage. And no food or drinks except water… alright. I can do that. And you’ll tell me when to come back after the results are ready? Just make sure to remind me. I sometimes forget things these days. And I hope the results are nothing serious. I just want to feel better, that’s all. So… what do I need to do now? Should I go home and start fasting? Or is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Just tell me everything, please. I don’t want to forget anything. And thank you for being so patient with me. I appreciate it very much. You’re a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. I'm happy to help. Yes, you can go home now and begin fasting. I'm writing down instructions for the fasting and a list of the tests we ordered. I'll also schedule you for the blood draw tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The CT scan will be scheduled for later in the week, once we have the blood test results. Here's my direct line. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I’ll make a note to remind you about the appointment. We will get to the bottom of this, Soila. And we’ll take things one step at a time. Please try to rest and stay hydrated. If you experience any severe symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s very kind of you to write down everything. And giving me your number… that’s very thoughtful. I appreciate it very much. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll try to rest and stay hydrated, like you said. And I’ll call you if I have any problems. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I feel a little better now, knowing you’re taking care of me. I hope the tests don’t take too long. And I hope they don’t find anything serious. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. We’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. Take care, and I'll see you tomorrow morning. .
