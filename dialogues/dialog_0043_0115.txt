DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about my… about a patient. A young man. He’s… quite yellow, you see. It’s his skin. And I’m… I’m supposed to be figuring out the… the amounts. The doses. For… for treatment. But it's all a bit… foggy, honestly. I just want to get this sorted, if you don’t mind. It’s about his liver, I believe. He has… something with his liver. And jaundice, yes, that’s it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Durig. It sounds like you're assisting with the care of a young man experiencing jaundice, and you're needing some clarification regarding treatment and dosages. That's perfectly alright – it’s always best to be thorough. Just to be clear, are you a medical professional yourself, or are you a family member assisting with his care?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, a professional. A… a dosimetrist, I am. Though, as I said, things aren’t as clear as they used to be. It’s been a long time, you see. A very long time. I work with the… the radiation. To… to make it just right. For the… for the cancer. Though I'm not sure this is cancer, specifically. Just… helping with the amounts. That's all. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Durig. A dosimetrist – that’s very helpful to know. So, you're assisting with radiation therapy planning for this young man, and you're concerned about potential liver involvement, leading to the jaundice. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me more about why you suspect liver involvement?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… it was the doctor. The other doctor. He said something about… Hepatitis. And the liver being… unhappy. Something about the bilirubin being high. I calculate the… the units. The grays. But I don’t… I don’t really understand the Hepatitis part. Or why his skin is yellow. I just… I need to be sure I’m putting the right numbers in the machine. Is that… is that making sense? It’s all very technical, and I'm afraid I’m not as sharp as I once was.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Durig. You're focusing on your area of expertise – the radiation calculations – and you're rightfully seeking clarification on the underlying medical condition to ensure accurate treatment planning. Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, and that inflammation can cause bilirubin, a substance your liver processes, to build up in the body, leading to jaundice – the yellowing of the skin and eyes. To help me understand the situation better, do you have access to this young man’s medical records?
PATIENT: Records? Oh… I don't believe so. I just received the… the order. With the… the specifications. The area to treat. And… and a note about the jaundice. And the… the Hepatitis. I don't have anything else. The other doctor, he just sent me the… the numbers, essentially. And asked me to… to calculate the doses. It's… very unusual, honestly. Usually, I have more information. More… context. It’s all a bit rushed, if you don’t mind my saying so. I just want to be certain. Certain that I’m doing it correctly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Durig. Receiving an order without sufficient clinical context is unusual, and your diligence in seeking clarification is commendable. It's always best to err on the side of caution, especially when patient safety is involved. Given the limited information, and the fact that you don’t have access to his full medical history, I would recommend we proceed with caution. Do you know the young man’s name and date of birth?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, let me see… …His name… it’s… Elias Vance. And his date of birth… August 14th, 1998. Yes, that’s right. 1998. I believe that is correct. Though… sometimes these numbers look similar, you see. It’s hard to be certain. I apologize. But I think that is accurate. Is that enough for you to… to look things up?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, that's perfect. Thank you. Okay, it appears Elias Vance was seen in the emergency department three days ago, on July 31st, with complaints of fatigue, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Initial labs show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, consistent with acute hepatitis. The likely cause is listed as Hepatitis A, though further testing is pending. He was admitted to the hospital for observation and supportive care. It seems he is now being considered for radiation therapy, presumably to address a related underlying condition. Do you know what condition they are intending to treat with radiation?
PATIENT: Radiation? Oh… I don't… I don't know what they’re treating. The order just said… “Hepatic mass.” That’s all it said. “Hepatic mass, calculate dose for radiation.” I assumed… well, I assumed it was related to the Hepatitis. Something… growing in the liver. But I didn't ask. I rarely ask. It's… not my place, usually. I just calculate the numbers. I worry about the… the grays. The units. The proper dosage. That’s all I do. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. This is all very… confusing. And I'm afraid I'm not feeling very well myself today. Perhaps… perhaps this should be reviewed by someone else?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Durig. Receiving an order with such limited information, especially when it concerns a complex condition like a hepatic mass and potential radiation therapy, is concerning. And I appreciate your honesty about not having the full clinical picture. You are absolutely right to question this, and you are not being unreasonable at all. It’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the diagnosis and treatment plan before proceeding with any calculations. Given the situation, and your own concerns, I would strongly recommend we do have this reviewed by the oncologist overseeing Elias Vance’s care. It would be irresponsible to proceed without a complete understanding of the situation. I can contact them directly, if you’d like. Or, if you prefer, we can postpone any calculations until we have more information. What would you be most comfortable with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, that would be… wonderful. Please, contact them. Contact the oncologist. That would be… a great relief. I just want to be sure. Sure that I’m not… making a mistake. It’s… it’s a lot of responsibility, you see. And I'm afraid I'm not as sharp as I once was. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Perhaps… perhaps I should just go home now. I don't think I'm being very helpful. It's all a bit… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Durig. Absolutely. It sounds like you need to rest. Please, don't worry about a thing. I will contact the oncologist immediately and get clarification on the diagnosis and treatment plan. I will also make sure you are kept informed every step of the way. Please, go home and take care of yourself. We will handle this from here. And thank you for bringing this to my attention – your diligence is greatly appreciated. Have a good day, Ms. Durig. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. .
