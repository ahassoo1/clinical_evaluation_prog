DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I… I gotta go somewhere. Just need… shots, I think? For travel. My wife… she always took care of this stuff. Now I just… gotta get it done. Don't know where exactly I'm going yet, though. Something with mountains, maybe?
DOCTOR: “Something with mountains.” Very specific. Travel vaccinations require knowing where precisely you’re traveling, Mr. Tayar. We can’t simply administer a broad-spectrum assortment of injections based on vague geographical preferences. Do you have any concrete travel plans?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, my wife handled everything. I just… I got a letter, okay? From… someone. Said I need to go. She would have known all the places… I don't remember the name of the country. It was… cold. Lots of snow. That’s all I got. Is that good enough? Look, I work with planes all day, I don't have time for remembering countries! Just tell me what I need, alright?
DOCTOR: “She would have known.” Right. Well, without a destination, we’re operating in the dark. Let’s see… any history of travel vaccinations at all that you recall?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe? I think so. When I was younger, I went… somewhere with my wife. Some islands, I think. Hot. Lots of beach. But that was… a long time ago. Before… everything. I don’t remember what shots I got, just that I got them. Honestly, it’s all a blur. Don't make me think so hard, okay? It makes my head hurt.
DOCTOR: “It makes my head hurt.” Hmm. According to this EHR – and frankly, it’s rather sparse – you had a tetanus booster ten years ago and… a flu shot last winter. That’s it. Mr. Tayar, if you’re intending to travel internationally, particularly to a region with “mountains” and “snow,” you absolutely need to know your destination. We’re talking potential risks like Hepatitis A, Typhoid, Yellow Fever… possibly even Rabies depending on the location. I need specifics. Do you have any documentation, a travel itinerary, anything at all that might indicate where you're going?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you, I don’t! It was a letter. Just a letter saying “go to the mountains”. No address, no nothing. Some old friend of my wife’s, maybe? I don't know! And look, I work with airplanes. I'm around germs all the time. I got a good immune system, alright? I don't need all these… fancy shots. This is ridiculous. Just give me something, anything, so I can go! Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: “A good immune system” is not a substitute for proper vaccination, Mr. Tayar. Your insistence on withholding vital information is… frankly, irresponsible. I am obligated to ensure your health and safety, and I cannot do so without knowing your destination. However… given your… reluctance to cooperate and the limited time, I will offer a very basic course of preventative measures. This is not comprehensive and does not absolve you of responsibility should you encounter any health issues abroad. I will administer a Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccine. We will also administer a booster of Tdap, given the ten-year lapse. This will provide some protection, but it is far from ideal. Do you consent to these vaccines, understanding their limitations?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just do it. Get it over with. I gotta go. And don't try to tell me I'm irresponsible. You're the doctor, shouldn't you just know what I need? Just… hurry up. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: “Just hurry up.” Very well. Nurse, please prepare Mr. Tayar for Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and a Tdap booster. I trust you've documented his… unconventional medical history. And Mr. Tayar, I strongly advise you to obtain detailed travel information and consult with a specialist upon your return. I have documented my concerns regarding your lack of cooperation. Please remain seated.
