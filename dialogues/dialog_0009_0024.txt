DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx, and I’m pleased to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, it’s a bit complicated, but basically, the airline needs it. I lost my husband last year, and there’s some paperwork involved with traveling internationally to settle things. They just need a doctor’s note saying I’m fit to fly, I think.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Kiante. That must be incredibly difficult. I'm happy to help with the letter, of course. To make sure I can write a comprehensive note, could you tell me a little more about your current health?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… sudden. As for my health, I’m generally okay. No major problems, really. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. I'm 176 centimeters tall and weigh around 131 pounds, if that helps. I haven’t been sick in… well, I can’t even remember the last time, honestly. Everything's been pretty routine. I mostly just wanted to get this letter so I can… move on with things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy, Kiante. And thank you for providing that information – height and weight are always helpful. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you experienced any recent changes in your appetite or weight, aside from what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. My appetite is normal, and my weight has been steady. I haven’t lost or gained anything significant. I really don’t have any digestive issues or anything like that either. I eat pretty regularly, mostly healthy foods when I can. Honestly, the biggest change in my life recently is… well, you know. Losing my husband. Everything else feels…secondary.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kiante. Grief can certainly overshadow everything else. Okay. And have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of that. My heart feels fine. I walk a fair bit, just around town, nothing strenuous, but I don't get winded or anything. No pain, no fluttering… nothing like that at all. I really don't have any heart problems that I know of. My doctor always said my blood pressure was good during my check-ups too.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring. Any issues with your sleep?
PATIENT: That… is a bit harder. I have trouble falling asleep sometimes. I think about things, naturally. But once I’m asleep, I sleep okay. I don't wake up gasping for air or anything like that. It's just… getting to sleep can be a struggle. I don’t take anything for it, though. Just try to relax before bed. I do try to maintain a routine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It’s very common to have sleep disturbances during times of grief. Now, just to cover all bases, have you noticed any recent changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No. Everything’s… regular. No problems there. I haven’t noticed anything unusual at all, honestly. I apologize if I seem… detailed, I just want to be sure I’m telling you everything. I really just want this letter and to get back to things. It’s a long story involving estates and… well, it’s complicated. I just need to fly there to sort everything out.
DOCTOR: You aren’t being overly detailed at all, Kiante. It’s good you’re being thorough, and I appreciate it. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take any pills, vitamins, or anything. I try to eat healthy and get enough rest, as I said, and that’s usually enough. I haven't needed anything stronger. I really avoid taking medication if I can. It’s just… not something I do. I really don’t have any allergies either, as far as I know. Just nothing. I apologize for being so… straightforward, it’s just a simple case, I think.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Kiante. It's good to know you aren't taking any medications or have any known allergies. Now, I'd like to just ask a few questions about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or asthma?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, honestly. My regular doctor always said I had a clean bill of health. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing. I haven't been hospitalized for anything serious in my life. A few minor things when I was a child, like chickenpox, but nothing major. I really haven’t had any significant medical issues to speak of. Does this seem like enough information for the letter?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Kiante. It sounds like you have a very healthy medical history. Before we proceed with the letter, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to be thorough. It will be quick – checking your heart and lungs, blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I understand you want to be thorough. The quicker we get this done, the better, honestly. I just want this letter and to be able to move forward. Please, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 120/78 – good. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes briefly. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Everything seems to be within normal limits, Kiante. Do you have any questions about anything I've done so far?
PATIENT: No, everything seems fine. You said everything’s normal, right? That’s good. I wasn’t worried, but… it’s good to hear. I’m just glad it wasn't a long process. So… can you write the letter now? I really appreciate your help, Doctor. This means a lot to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything appears to be within normal limits. Absolutely. I can write the letter for you now, stating that you are medically cleared to fly. It will mention your generally good health and the findings of the physical exam I just performed. Is there a specific airline or any particular requirements I should include in the letter?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a general statement saying I'm fit to fly is fine. I think they just need something on official letterhead from a doctor. I didn’t really ask many questions when they told me, I just wanted to get this sorted. Honestly, I was still… dealing with things when they requested it. I just need it to be official and say I’m okay to travel internationally. Do you need my full name and date of birth for the letter? I can give it to you.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Full name and date of birth would be helpful for the letter. Also, do you have any preferred method for receiving the letter?
PATIENT: My name is Kiante Sayar, and my date of birth is July 12th, 1992. As for receiving the letter… could you just print it out for me? I’m here now, so that would be the easiest. I don’t really need a digital copy or anything. Just a hard copy would be perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. I really can't thank you enough for your help. This is a huge weight off my shoulders.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kiante. Here is the letter, dated August 2nd, 2025, stating that you are medically cleared for international travel. It includes your full name, date of birth, and a summary of your good health. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that looks perfect. Everything’s correct. My name and date of birth are right, and it says everything I need it to say. Thank you so much, Doctor Petrimoulx. You’ve really been a lifesaver. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me with this. I think this is everything I needed to finally… get things sorted.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Safe travels, and I wish you all the best in settling everything.
