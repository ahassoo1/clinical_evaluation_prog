DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s about… a letter. For a pet, you see. A very important pet. Honestly, all this paperwork these days, it’s just… a nuisance. I think they said I needed something from a doctor to… prove I can handle it? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A letter… for a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter! Really, it's quite ridiculous. They want to make sure I'm… capable. As if! I’ve always been perfectly responsible. It's just… some sort of requirement for… well, never you mind what kind of pet. It’s a beautiful one, that’s all that matters. And a bit high-maintenance, I suppose. But still. A letter. Do you need me to tell you what it's for, specifically? It feels like a lot of unnecessary questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, I need some information to write this letter. “Capable” is rather vague. Is this related to any specific health concerns of yours that might affect your ability to care for… this pet?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Goodness, no! I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. A little tired, perhaps, but who isn’t? I just… don’t understand why my personal health is any of their business when it comes to an animal. It's not like I'm incapable of walking or feeding myself, is it? Honestly, it's probably just some new rule someone made up to bother people. But fine, if you must know… I get a little forgetful sometimes. But that’s it! It's hardly a debilitating condition.
DOCTOR: Forgetful, you say. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… just little things. Where I put my keys, appointments… sometimes I blank on names. Nothing serious! It’s just… as you get older, things aren't as sharp, you know? It's not like I'm wandering off or anything. It’s more… I might need a reminder. Or I might ask you to repeat yourself. But it doesn’t mean I can't provide for a lovely creature, Doctor! I’m a very capable woman, despite a few… senior moments. Really, the whole thing is quite insulting.
DOCTOR: And what sort of care does this “lovely creature” require?
PATIENT: Oh, it needs… everything, really. Proper food, of course. And lots of attention. It’s a very social animal. And regular… well, it needs to be exercised, and kept clean. It's a bit of a diva, to be honest. Demands a certain… standard of living. It's not a goldfish, if that's what you were thinking! Honestly, I shouldn’t have to be explaining all this. Anyone could see it's a special animal. It's just… a lot. But I can handle it. I do handle it!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm… Let me think. Oh! Yes, there was something the doctor gave me a while back… for my… well, for helping me sleep. It wasn't doing much, to be honest. I stopped taking it, really. It just made me feel… foggy. And I didn't want to be more forgetful, if you can believe it! I think it was a small blue pill… but honestly, I don’t even remember the name. It was ages ago. Why is this so important, Doctor? This is starting to feel like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: It's important because medications can sometimes affect memory and cognitive function, Ms. Wrye. Even something you stopped taking can have lingering effects. Do you recall the name of the doctor who prescribed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A doctor… It was… Dr. Adebayo, I think? Yes, Dr. Adebayo. He was… somewhere downtown, I believe. He retired last year, I heard. Honestly, I just went to him because my sister recommended him. She always thinks I need something. Always fussing over me. And this sleep thing wasn't even that bad, just a bit of trouble getting off. Look, Doctor, are we going to get to this letter or are we going to talk about my sister and my sleeping habits all day? I have things to do, you know. This animal needs me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Oh dear… Let me think. Well, I had a bit of trouble with my… well, my blood pressure a few years back. But it was nothing serious! A bit of stress, that’s all. And the doctor said I needed to watch my salt intake. Honestly, it's hard to remember everything. I'm a busy woman, you know. And it was ages ago. They gave me some pills for that too, I think… But honestly, I don't recall the details. It’s all a bit fuzzy. Really, I'm generally quite healthy, for my age. I don't go around complaining, you know. Are you sure all these questions are necessary for a simple letter?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I'm documenting your medical history. It's important to have a complete picture. Did this blood pressure issue require any hospitalization or specialist care?
PATIENT: Hospitalization? Oh, no, goodness no! Never. Just regular check-ups with my GP. He was a lovely man, Dr. Olamide. Very patient. He said it was just a little… elevated. And I was supposed to… cut back on caffeine, I think? Honestly, it’s hard to keep track of all these doctors and their instructions. They all say different things. And frankly, I enjoy my tea. I’m a Nigerian woman, Doctor! We drink tea. It’s… it’s part of our culture! Are you suggesting I change my lifestyle for a… for this letter? It's absurd!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. However, I need to gather enough information to responsibly fulfill this request. Have you noticed any recent changes in your memory or cognitive abilities beyond the occasional forgetfulness you've mentioned?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… now that you mention it… I have been misplacing things more often. Not just keys, but… important papers. And sometimes I struggle to find the right words. It’s… frustrating, really. I used to be so sharp. And I’ve been getting a bit more… irritable, I suppose. Snapping at people. My daughter says I’m being unreasonable. Honestly, I don't know what's happening! But I wouldn't say it's anything serious. Just… getting older. It happens, doesn't it? Are we nearly finished with this interrogation, Doctor? I really need to get going. This animal is waiting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, based on what you’ve described, and the changes you've recently reported, I have some concerns. While I can write a letter, I strongly recommend you undergo a more thorough evaluation by a neurologist. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. It could be something entirely benign, but it's important to be certain. I can provide a referral if you wish.
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, goodness no! That sounds… dreadful. Are you saying I’m… losing my mind? Honestly, Doctor, I just want a letter for my pet. It's not like I'm piloting a plane or anything! I’m perfectly capable of caring for an animal. And I resent the implication that I’m not. I think I’ll just… find another doctor. This is all a bit too much. I came here for a simple letter, not a medical examination. I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. I understand your reluctance. However, I must prioritize your well-being, and I cannot responsibly fulfill this request without addressing my concerns. I am unable to write the letter at this time. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a neurologist for a proper evaluation. I wish you all the best.
