DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… satisfactory to meet you as well. I understand you’re Scottish? My husband… he finds the Highlands quite fascinating. But, to the matter at hand. I require some forms. Advance Directive, I believe it is called, or perhaps a POLST. My solicitor suggested I have these prepared, just in case. It’s… prudent to be organized, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am originally from Scotland – the Highlands are rather special. And you are absolutely right to be proactive, Marija. It’s very sensible to have those documents prepared. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both excellent ideas. Before we get started on those forms though, and just to be thorough, is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: Anything else? No. Really. I am perfectly healthy, thank you very much. It’s simply a matter of… foresight. My solicitor, a very reputable man, explained these documents are for when one is… incapacitated. Not that I expect to be. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, you know. But one must be prepared. Is this going to be a lengthy process? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're feeling well and proactive about your health. And no, it shouldn't be a lengthy process at all. We’ll mostly be going through the forms to ensure your wishes are clearly documented. It’s more about understanding your preferences and making sure everything is legally sound. Just so I have a complete picture, and it’s standard practice, could I ask a few quick questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Really, Doctor? I assure you, it’s quite unremarkable. I’ve had the usual childhood ailments, of course – measles, mumps… things of that nature. But nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized, never had surgery. I've always been… robust. Are you suggesting I might have some hidden ailment? Because I assure you, my annual check-ups are impeccable. My physician in Casablanca… well, he was very thorough.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Marija. I apologize if that came across that way. It’s simply routine – I ask everyone about their medical history, even those who are in excellent health, as you clearly are. It helps me get a complete understanding, and ensures I can guide you appropriately with these important forms. So, if you don’t mind, just a few quick questions. Have you been seeing a physician regularly, and when was your last check-up?
PATIENT: Regularly? Of course. Dr. Benani, in Casablanca. A very distinguished gentleman. However… well, that was… some time ago. Perhaps a year and a half ago. My husband and I relocated to the States last year, and I haven't yet… established a new physician here. I’ve been meaning to, of course. It's simply been… difficult, settling in. A great deal of paperwork, you understand. And finding a doctor of comparable… caliber to Dr. Benani? That’s proving rather challenging, I must say. Are you acquainted with any physicians in the area? Perhaps someone with international experience?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand settling into a new country can be quite disruptive, and finding a new physician is often a priority. A year and a half since your last check-up is a little while, so it would be good to get a general check-up scheduled soon, alongside completing these forms. I’m happy to provide some recommendations. Before we move on to recommendations though, are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any chronic health conditions – even something seemingly minor, like high blood pressure or cholesterol?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. A healthy diet, plenty of exercise… that’s all one needs. As for chronic conditions… absolutely not. My blood pressure is impeccable, my cholesterol is… well, let’s just say I eat a very sensible diet. I do occasionally suffer from… mild headaches, if I’m particularly stressed, but nothing that requires… intervention. Honestly, Doctor, I am a very healthy woman. Are you questioning my self-assessment?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Marija. I am certainly not questioning your self-assessment. It’s good to hear you’re so diligent about your health. I'm simply asking routine questions to ensure I have a complete picture. Regarding the headaches, could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. They're… tension headaches, I believe. Usually occur when I am… preparing for a particularly important social event. Or dealing with… administrative difficulties. Things of that nature. They are not debilitating, Doctor. A cup of mint tea and a darkened room usually suffice. Honestly, I fail to see the relevance of this line of questioning. Are you implying these… insignificant headaches warrant some sort of… medical attention? My time is rather valuable, you know. I have a book club meeting this evening, and I haven’t even begun to prepare my critique of Proust.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Marija. I assure you I’m not implying anything requires immediate attention. I simply ask to understand the context of your health as a whole. Even seemingly minor symptoms can sometimes be helpful information. Now, just to complete the basic history, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I have a rather robust constitution, as I’ve mentioned. I eat everything, travel everywhere… I’ve never had an allergic reaction in my life. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… patronizing. It’s as if you don’t believe me when I tell you I am a perfectly healthy woman. I have a very demanding social calendar, and I simply don’t have time for this… exhaustive interrogation. Can we please move on to the forms? I'd like to get this completed before my luncheon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. It’s simply my practice to gather a comprehensive understanding, but I respect your wishes and we can absolutely move on to the Advance Directive and POLST forms. Before we begin, would you mind if I quickly measure your height and weight?
PATIENT: Measure my height and weight? Now really, Doctor. Do you find my stature… questionable? I am perfectly aware of my dimensions. As I mentioned, I am a tall woman. And, frankly, it feels rather… demeaning to be subjected to a physical examination for what is, ostensibly, a paperwork exercise. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of completing the forms myself. If you would simply provide them, I would be most grateful. I have important things to attend to, and this… scrutiny is proving rather… time-consuming. Do you have the forms ready, or must I wait while you continue to… assess my physical attributes?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. I sincerely apologize. It was inappropriate of me to suggest a physical examination without explaining the relevance and obtaining your consent. I am clearly not being as considerate of your time and preferences as I should be. Please accept my apologies again. Let's move directly to the Advance Directive and POLST forms. Here they are. I will be happy to answer any questions you have as you complete them, and I can offer guidance if you'd like.
PATIENT: Finally. Thank you, Doctor. That is all I ask. I prefer to work independently, you see. I am perfectly capable of understanding the legal implications of these documents. My solicitor, as I’ve mentioned, is a very reputable man, and he’s already explained the key provisions. Although, honestly, the font size is rather small. Perhaps you have a magnifying glass? My eyesight isn't quite what it used to be. And the terminology… rather dense, isn't it? "Surrogate decision-maker?" Goodness. It sounds positively Dickensian.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here you are. And you're right to point that out – the legal terminology can be quite dense. I'm happy to explain any terms or provisions that are unclear. That's what I'm here for. Please, take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need assistance with anything at all. I apologize again for the unnecessary delays and for not being more mindful of your time and preferences.
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. Thank you. This is… marginally better. Although, honestly, the question of life-sustaining treatment is rather… alarming. "Do not resuscitate?" Goodness. As if one wants to be resuscitated? It’s all rather morbid, isn’t it? My husband believes strongly in aggressive intervention, you see. He’s a very practical man. And I always defer to his judgment on… these matters. Although, honestly, the thought of… prolonged artificial life support… it’s rather ghastly. Perhaps you could explain the implications of ticking this box? In plain English, of course. None of this legal jargon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. It's perfectly understandable that this section feels alarming. It's a difficult thing to consider. Essentially, this "Do Not Resuscitate" section addresses what happens if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. "Resuscitation" means CPR – chest compressions and attempts to restart your heart – and potentially, the use of a breathing machine. If you do not wish to have these interventions performed, ticking this box indicates that you want your healthcare team to focus on comfort and pain relief, rather than attempting to prolong life through aggressive measures. It doesn't mean you won't receive any care; it simply clarifies your wishes regarding life-prolonging procedures in a critical situation. It’s a very personal decision, and it’s entirely appropriate to discuss it with your husband. Many people choose to have a conversation with their loved ones and make a joint decision. Would you like me to go over the other options available, or perhaps explain the potential consequences of each choice in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm. "Comfort and pain relief…" That sounds… acceptable, I suppose. Although, my husband… he’s rather insistent on “doing everything possible.” He believes modern medicine offers… miraculous interventions. He read an article about a man who was… brought back from clinical death with a new experimental procedure. Honestly, I’m rather overwhelmed. This is all so… complicated. Perhaps I should simply leave this section blank? Would that be… permissible? Then my husband could… make the decision when the time comes? He has a very… pragmatic mind. Although, frankly, I dread the thought of him… interfering with my final arrangements. He has such… strong opinions.
DOCTOR: Leaving the section blank is a permissible option, Marija. It essentially means that your husband would be considered your surrogate decision-maker, and he would have the authority to make decisions regarding your care in the event you are unable to communicate your wishes. However, leaving it blank also means that medical staff would likely defer to his preference for aggressive intervention, as you mentioned. It’s often helpful to have a conversation with your husband about this, and to try to reach a consensus on your wishes. We could even schedule a time for all three of us to discuss it together, if you’d like. There's no right or wrong answer, and it's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. The important thing is to make a decision that you are comfortable with, and that reflects your values and priorities. Would you like me to explain the potential benefits and drawbacks of ticking the box, versus leaving it blank, in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm. A joint discussion… Perhaps. Although, my husband… he can be rather… dominating in these matters. He believes he knows what's best for me, you see. And he's very good at… articulating his opinions. Honestly, this is all so… exhausting. I simply wanted a few forms completed, and now I'm embroiled in a philosophical debate about… the sanctity of life! What about this section here? "Advance Healthcare Directive?" What precisely is an advance healthcare directive? It sounds rather… bureaucratic. And what does it entail? Is it something I need to do in addition to this "Do Not Resuscitate" order? Or is it… redundant? Honestly, Doctor, I am beginning to feel quite faint. Perhaps a glass of water?
DOCTOR: Here you are, Marija. Please, take a moment to drink this. I understand this is overwhelming, and you're absolutely right to question everything. I apologize for the complexity. An Advance Healthcare Directive is a legal document that allows you to specify your wishes regarding your healthcare in the event you are unable to communicate them yourself. It's broader than a "Do Not Resuscitate" order, which specifically addresses resuscitation. The Directive can include things like your preferences for medical treatment, the types of care you want to receive, and who you want to make healthcare decisions for you if you are unable to do so. It’s a way to ensure your wishes are respected, even if you are unable to speak for yourself. It’s not redundant – it’s actually a complementary document. The "Do Not Resuscitate" order can be included within the Advance Healthcare Directive, along with other specific instructions. Would you like me to go through an example of an Advance Healthcare Directive, so you can see how it works in practice?
PATIENT: Hmm. So it’s a… comprehensive document. A sort of… testament to my healthcare preferences. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure I have… strong preferences on all these matters. I trust medical professionals to make sound judgments, you see. I believe they have years of training and experience. But my sister… she had a rather… unfortunate experience with a doctor a few years ago. He insisted on aggressive treatment, even though she explicitly stated she wanted palliative care. It was… traumatic for all of us. Perhaps it’s better to be… proactive, in case something like that happens to me. But honestly, I’m dreadfully unqualified to make these sorts of decisions. I’m a literature professor, not a medical expert!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Marija. It’s not about being a medical expert; it’s about expressing your values and ensuring your wishes are respected. And your sister’s experience is a valid reason to be proactive. The Advance Healthcare Directive doesn’t require you to make detailed medical decisions. You can simply state your overall preferences – for example, that you prioritize comfort and quality of life, or that you trust your doctor to make the best decisions for you. You can also designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. Would you like me to provide you with some examples of common preferences, so you can see how others have approached this?
PATIENT: Hmm. Examples, you say? That might be… helpful. I suppose it’s easier to understand if I see how others have… phrased their wishes. And what about this "healthcare proxy?" Who would be… suitable? My husband, of course, is the obvious choice. But he can be… rather inflexible in his views. And my sister… she lives in Morocco. She wouldn’t be able to… readily attend to these matters. Honestly, Doctor, this is all so… complicated. I simply wanted a few forms completed, and now I'm embroiled in a… existential crisis! Perhaps I should simply leave everything blank and hope for the best? It’s less stressful, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, Marija. And it’s perfectly acceptable to consider leaving everything blank if that’s what feels most comfortable for you. However, before you make that decision, let’s explore some options. The healthcare proxy doesn’t have to be your husband, even though he’s the obvious choice. It can be a close friend, a trusted family member, or even your literature colleague, if you believe they would respect your wishes. The important thing is to choose someone you trust implicitly, and who is willing to advocate for your preferences. Let me provide you with some examples of common preferences and proxy selections. Then we can discuss which options feel most comfortable for you. And if you’re still unsure, we can always revisit this at a later date. There’s no rush.
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. Examples, you say? Perhaps that will… clarify matters. Although, frankly, the thought of discussing my mortality with my colleagues… it's rather… unbecoming. I’m a literature professor, not a… medical case study! "I wish to receive aggressive treatment at all costs?" Goodness. That sounds… alarmingly proactive. And "I wish to prioritize comfort and quality of life?" That sounds… rather defeatist. Honestly, Doctor, this is all so… subjective. There's no right answer, is there? Perhaps I should simply defer to my husband. He has a very… pragmatic mind. Although, frankly, I dread the thought of him… making these decisions for me. He has such… strong opinions.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Marija. There’s no right or wrong answer. It’s entirely subjective, and it’s perfectly valid to feel conflicted. And it’s understandable to feel pressured by your husband’s opinions. Let's approach this differently. Instead of focusing on specific treatment options, let's think about your overall values and priorities. What’s most important to you in life?
PATIENT: Hmm. Values and priorities… That’s a rather… philosophical question. I suppose… intellectual pursuits are paramount. A love of literature, art, music… the pursuit of knowledge, beauty, and truth. And… a comfortable existence, of course. A beautiful home, good food, stimulating conversation… Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to live a meaningful life, surrounded by beauty and intellectual stimulation. And I want to die with dignity and grace, without suffering unnecessary pain or indignity. But… how does one translate those abstract values into… medical instructions? It's all so… bewildering.
DOCTOR: That's beautifully put, Marija. And you’ve already translated those values into something very concrete. You prioritize a meaningful life and a dignified end-of-life experience. In medical terms, that often translates to a preference for comfort care, pain management, and avoiding aggressive interventions that may prolong life at the expense of quality of life. It doesn’t mean you wouldn’t receive medical treatment if you were seriously ill. It simply means you would want your healthcare team to focus on relieving your suffering and ensuring your comfort, rather than pursuing treatments that may be more harmful than beneficial. Would you like me to explain how that might look in practice?
PATIENT: Hmm. Comfort care, pain management… That sounds… acceptable, I suppose. Although, my husband… he believes in fighting to the very end. He read an article about a man who… recovered from a terminal illness with a new experimental drug. He believes in miracles, you see. Honestly, Doctor, this is all so… frustrating. I simply want to live a meaningful life, surrounded by beauty and intellectual stimulation. And I want to die with dignity and grace, without suffering unnecessary pain or indignity. But I also want to avoid upsetting my husband. He can be… rather inflexible in his views.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re in a difficult position, Marija, trying to balance your own wishes with your husband’s beliefs. It’s perfectly understandable to feel frustrated. Perhaps we can frame this as a conversation with your husband, rather than a decision you need to make alone. We could explain the benefits of both aggressive treatment and comfort care, and help you both reach a consensus that feels comfortable for everyone. Would you be open to scheduling a joint appointment?
PATIENT: Hmm. A joint appointment… That might be… helpful, I suppose. Although, frankly, I dread the thought of a… confrontation with my husband. He can be… rather dominant in these matters. He has a very… strong personality. Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to live a meaningful life, surrounded by beauty and intellectual stimulation. And I want to die with dignity and grace, without suffering unnecessary pain or indignity. But I also want to avoid upsetting my husband. He can be… rather inflexible in his views. Perhaps… perhaps we should simply leave everything blank. It’s less stressful, you see. And then… then my husband can make the decisions. It’s less stressful, you see. But… but what if he makes the wrong decisions?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly acceptable to choose to leave everything blank, Marija. It's your decision, and we will respect your wishes. However, before you finalize that decision, let’s just explore one more option. Even if you defer to your husband, you can still have a conversation with him about your wishes. You can express your preferences for comfort care, pain management, and avoiding aggressive interventions that may prolong life at the expense of quality of life. You don’t need to have a formal Advance Directive to have that conversation. It’s simply a way to ensure your voice is heard, even if you ultimately defer to his judgment. Would you be open to discussing how to approach that conversation with your husband?
PATIENT: Hmm. A conversation… That might be… acceptable, I suppose. Although, frankly, I dread the thought of a… confrontation with my husband. He can be… rather dismissive of my opinions. He has a very… strong personality. Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to live a meaningful life, surrounded by beauty and intellectual stimulation. And I want to die with dignity and grace, without suffering unnecessary pain or indignity. But I also want to avoid upsetting my husband. He can be… rather inflexible in his views. Perhaps… perhaps you could help me… phrase my wishes in a way that he will understand? He respects… authority figures, you see. Perhaps if you explained the benefits of comfort care… he might listen. But… but what if he still disagrees?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I would be happy to facilitate that conversation. I can explain the benefits of both aggressive treatment and comfort care in a neutral and objective manner, and help you both reach a consensus that feels comfortable for everyone. We can schedule a joint appointment, or if you prefer, we can simply have a phone conversation with all three of us present. It’s entirely up to you. I want you to feel comfortable and empowered, regardless of what you decide. Would you like me to schedule a joint appointment, or would you prefer to start with a phone call?
PATIENT: Hmm. A phone call… Perhaps that would be… less stressful, I suppose. A joint appointment feels… rather confrontational. And a phone call allows me to… prepare my talking points in advance. Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to live a meaningful life, surrounded by beauty and intellectual stimulation. And I want to die with dignity and grace, without suffering unnecessary pain or indignity. But I also want to avoid upsetting my husband. He can be… rather inflexible in his views. Perhaps… perhaps you could help me… formulate those talking points? He respects… logic and reason, you see. Perhaps if you could explain the benefits of comfort care in a logical and objective manner… he might listen. But… but what if he still disagrees?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I would be happy to help you formulate those talking points. We can discuss your wishes and concerns, and I can craft a logical and objective presentation of information that you can share with your husband during the phone call. Here’s what we can focus on: the importance of comfort care, pain management, and avoiding unnecessary suffering. We can also discuss the potential benefits of focusing on quality of life, rather than simply prolonging life at all costs. Would you like to start by sharing your biggest concerns with me?
PATIENT: Hmm. My biggest concern… is that he will insist on aggressive treatment, even if it causes me unnecessary suffering. He read an article about a man who… recovered from a terminal illness with a new experimental drug. He believes in miracles, you see. Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to live a meaningful life, surrounded by beauty and intellectual stimulation. And I want to die with dignity and grace, without suffering unnecessary pain or indignity. But I also want to avoid upsetting my husband. He can be… rather inflexible in his views. And he can be… dismissive of my opinions. He believes in… logic and reason. But he also believes in… fighting to the very end. It’s… exhausting. What if he refuses to listen? What if he insists on aggressive treatment, even if it causes me unnecessary suffering?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're very worried about your husband's potential reaction, Marija. And it's perfectly understandable to feel that way. It’s okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. We can approach this by framing aggressive treatment not as the default option, but as one of several options. We can discuss the potential benefits and risks of each option, and help him understand that aggressive treatment may not always be the best choice. We can also emphasize that your comfort and quality of life are just as important as prolonging your life at all costs. I will help you articulate those points in a clear and logical manner. We can rehearse the conversation if you'd like, so you feel prepared and confident. Before we start formulating those talking points, would you like me to share my contact information with you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Your contact information… Perhaps. That might be… helpful. If I need to… clarify something before the phone call, you see. Or if I simply need… reassurance. Honestly, Doctor, I simply want to live a meaningful life, surrounded by beauty and intellectual stimulation. And I want to die with dignity and grace, without suffering unnecessary pain or indignity. But I also want to avoid upsetting my husband. He can be… rather inflexible in his views. And he can be… dismissive of my opinions. He believes in… logic and reason. But he also believes in… fighting to the very end. It’s… exhausting. And I’m… I’m simply not prepared for a… confrontation. What if he refuses to listen? What if he insists on aggressive treatment, even if it causes me unnecessary suffering?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. Here’s my card. Please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you need anything at all. I’m here to support you, and I will do everything I can to help you navigate this difficult situation. Before we start formulating those talking points, let’s just take a moment to focus on your wishes. What’s most important to you?
PATIENT: Hmm. What's most important to me… is to be comfortable. To not suffer. To… to die with dignity. And to… to be surrounded by beauty. To be able to listen to music. To… to read poetry. To… to spend time with my loved ones. Honestly, Doctor… I simply want to live out my remaining days in peace. But I’m afraid… I’m afraid my husband won’t allow me to. He believes in… fighting to the very end. And he won’t listen to reason. What if he insists on aggressive treatment, even if it causes me unnecessary suffering? What if he refuses to listen? I… I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Marija, it's okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. It sounds like you have very clear wishes, and it’s perfectly valid to want to live out your remaining days in peace. You deserve to have those wishes respected. We're going to work together to help your husband understand your perspective. We can frame it not as refusing treatment, but as choosing the right treatment – the treatment that prioritizes your comfort and quality of life. We can also emphasize that aggressive treatment isn't always the best choice, and that sometimes, the most compassionate thing to do is to focus on palliative care. Let’s start by writing down a list of your wishes. Then, we can formulate those wishes into a clear and logical presentation that you can share with your husband. We will rehearse the conversation if you’d like, so you feel prepared and confident. Would you like me to start by writing down those wishes for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes… please. That would be… helpful. I’m… I’m too upset to… to think clearly. Please… please write down my wishes. I want to be comfortable. I want to be free from pain. I want to be able to listen to music. I want to be able to read poetry. I want to spend time with my loved ones. I want to die with dignity. And… and I don’t want to be subjected to unnecessary suffering. Please… please write it down. And… and help me… help me explain it to my husband. I’m… I’m afraid he won’t listen.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marija. Let’s write this down together. “I wish to be comfortable and free from pain.” “I wish to be able to listen to music and read poetry.” “I wish to spend quality time with my loved ones.” “I wish to die with dignity and grace.” “And I wish to avoid unnecessary suffering.” Here you are. We have a clear list of your wishes. Now, we can work on formulating these wishes into a clear and logical presentation that you can share with your husband. Would you like me to help you craft those talking points?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes… please. That would be… helpful. I’m… I’m not sure how to… to express these wishes in a way that he will understand. He believes in… logic and reason. But he can be… dismissive of my feelings. He believes that fighting to the very end is… noble. But I… I simply want to live out my remaining days in peace. I want to be comfortable. I want to be free from pain. I want to die with dignity. Please… please help me craft those talking points. I’m… I’m afraid he won’t listen.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. We can absolutely frame these wishes in a logical manner. Let’s focus on the quality of life aspect. We can explain that aggressive treatment isn’t always the best choice, especially if it causes unnecessary suffering and reduces your quality of life. We can also emphasize that palliative care isn’t about “giving up,” but about focusing on comfort and dignity during your remaining days. Let’s start by crafting a statement that summarizes your wishes in a clear and concise manner. How about this: “I want to live out my remaining days in peace, surrounded by beauty and loved ones. I prioritize comfort and dignity, and I wish to avoid unnecessary suffering. I believe that palliative care is the best option for me, as it focuses on enhancing my quality of life during this difficult time.” How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm. That… that sounds good. Yes… that sounds good. But… but he will probably ask me… what exactly is “palliative care?” He believes that aggressive treatment is… always the best option. He believes that giving up is… unacceptable. He will probably ask me… why I don’t want to fight. He believes that fighting to the very end is… noble. He believes that suffering is… inevitable. What should I tell him? What should I say? I’m… I’m afraid he won’t listen.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point, Marija. It’s likely he will ask those questions. Let’s prepare some responses. Regarding what exactly is palliative care, you can explain that it focuses on relieving symptoms, enhancing quality of life, and providing emotional support. It’s not about “giving up,” but about prioritizing your comfort and dignity during this difficult time. You can emphasize that it allows you to spend quality time with loved ones, without unnecessary suffering. Regarding why you don’t want to “fight,” you can explain that you’ve thought long and hard about this, and you’ve come to the conclusion that aggressive treatment isn’t the best option for you. You can emphasize that you want to live out your remaining days in peace, surrounded by beauty and loved ones. You can also explain that you’re not afraid of dying, but you’re afraid of suffering. Does that sound helpful?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes… that sounds helpful. But… but he will probably ask me… what if the aggressive treatment works? He believes that miracles can happen. He believes that fighting to the very end is… always the best option. He will probably ask me… what if I regret my decision? He believes that giving up is… unacceptable. He believes that I’m not thinking clearly. What should I tell him? What should I say? I’m… I’m afraid he won’t listen. I’m… I’m afraid he’ll dismiss my feelings.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Marija. It’s likely he will bring up those points. Regarding the potential success of aggressive treatment, you can acknowledge that miracles can happen, but you can also explain that aggressive treatment isn't always successful, and it can have significant side effects. You can explain that you’ve weighed the risks and benefits, and you’ve come to the conclusion that palliative care is the best option for you. Regarding the potential for regret, you can explain that you’ve thought long and hard about this, and you’re confident in your decision. You can also explain that you’re not afraid of dying, but you’re afraid of suffering. You can emphasize that you want to live out your remaining days in peace, surrounded by beauty and loved ones, and you're making this decision to prioritize your quality of life. You can also say that you've discussed this with me, and I support your decision. Let’s practice saying some of these things out loud. Would you like to role-play with me?
PATIENT: Hmm. No… I… I can’t. I… I’m too upset. I… I can’t practice. I… I’m afraid I’ll… I’ll fall apart. I… I just want him to understand. I… I want him to respect my wishes. I… I want to live out my remaining days in peace. I… I want to die with dignity. What if he doesn’t listen? What if he dismisses my feelings? What if he… he forces me to undergo aggressive treatment? I… I’m afraid. I’m… I’m very afraid.
DOCTOR: Marija, it's okay to be afraid. It’s perfectly understandable to feel this way. You have very clear wishes, and you deserve to have those wishes respected. I’m here to support you, and I will do everything I can to help you navigate this difficult situation. If he doesn’t listen, we can explore other options. We can involve a mediator, or we can discuss the legal implications of his actions. But let’s focus on preparing you for the conversation first. Even if you don’t role-play with me, just having these talking points prepared will help you feel more confident and empowered. Let’s take a deep breath together. Now, let’s focus on what you want to say to him. What’s the most important thing you want him to understand?
PATIENT: Hmm. The most important thing… is that I want to live out my remaining days in peace. I… I want to spend time with my loved ones. I… I want to be comfortable. I… I want to die with dignity. I… I don’t want to suffer. I… I want him to respect my wishes. I… I want him to understand that I’ve thought long and hard about this. I… I want him to know that I’m not afraid of dying, but I’m afraid of suffering. I… I want him to listen to me. I… I want him to understand that this is my decision. I… I want him to respect my autonomy. I… I just want him to let me live out my remaining days in peace. I… I want him to understand that this is what’s best for me.
DOCTOR: Marija, those are very powerful and important words. You have every right to live out your remaining days in peace, and you deserve to have your wishes respected. You’ve thought long and hard about this, and you’ve clearly articulated what’s best for you. That’s all that matters. Now, let’s focus on preparing you for the conversation with your husband. We can write down a summary of your wishes, and we can practice some responses to his potential objections. But even if you don’t remember everything we’ve discussed, just remember those words: “I want to live out my remaining days in peace.” That’s the most important thing. Would you like me to write down a summary of your wishes now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes… please. That would be… helpful. I… I want to have something to show him. I… I want him to see that I’m serious. I… I want him to understand that this is not a whim. I… I want him to know that I’ve thought long and hard about this. I… I want him to respect my wishes. I… I just want him to let me live out my remaining days in peace. I… I want him to understand that this is what’s best for me. Please… please write it down.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marija. Here’s a summary of your wishes: “I have thought long and hard about my end-of-life care, and I have come to the conclusion that palliative care is the best option for me. I want to live out my remaining days in peace, surrounded by my loved ones. I prioritize comfort and dignity, and I wish to avoid unnecessary suffering. I am not afraid of dying, but I am afraid of suffering. I want to spend quality time with my loved ones, without unnecessary pain or discomfort. I am making this decision to prioritize my quality of life, and I respectfully request that my husband honors my wishes. I am confident in my decision, and I ask that he supports me in pursuing a peaceful and dignified end-of-life experience." Here you are. This is a clear and concise summary of your wishes. You can show this to your husband, and you can use it as a starting point for your conversation. Would you like me to make a copy of this for your medical record?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes… please. That would be… helpful. I… I want to have something on file. I… I want to make sure that my wishes are respected, even if… even if something happens to me. I… I just want to make sure that I’m in control of my own destiny. I… I want to live out my remaining days in peace, surrounded by my loved ones. I… I want to die with dignity. Thank you… thank you so much for your help. I… I don’t know what I would have done without you. You’ve given me hope… you’ve given me strength. I… I think I’m ready to talk to my husband now. I… I think I can do this.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Marija. I'm so glad I could help. And you are absolutely right – you can do this. You have every right to live out your remaining days in peace, and you deserve to have your wishes respected. I will make a copy of this for your medical record, and I will be here to support you in any way I can. If you’d like, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss how the conversation went. But even if you don’t schedule an appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact me if you need anything at all. Now, take a deep breath and remember those words: “I want to live out my remaining days in peace.” You are strong, and you are capable. Is there anything else I can do for you before you talk to your husband?
PATIENT: Hmm. No… I think I’m okay. I… I have everything I need. I… I just want to talk to my husband now. Thank you… thank you so much for everything. You’ve given me hope… you’ve given me strength. I… I will never forget your kindness. I… I think I’m ready.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Marija. I’m so glad I could help. Remember, you are strong, and you deserve to live out your remaining days in peace. I wish you all the best in your conversation with your husband. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you need anything at all. Take care, Marija. .
