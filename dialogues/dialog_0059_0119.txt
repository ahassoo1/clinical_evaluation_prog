DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me a little about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I don't usually complain, you see. But it’s… a problem. A rather unpleasant problem, frankly. And it’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. There’s no need to feel embarrassed – we’re here to help, and many things can be quite sensitive. Please, feel free to take your time and explain whatever is troubling you. We'll get to the bottom of it together. Perhaps you could start by telling me when you first noticed this problem, and what it feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it started… oh, goodness, let me think. Perhaps three weeks ago? It's a discharge, Doctor. An… unwelcome discharge. And it’s not… normal. It's a bit yellowish, if I may be so blunt, and there’s a… a smell. Not a pleasant smell, naturally. It’s… concerning. I’ve been trying to keep things very clean, you understand, but it hasn’t improved. I really don't know what’s brought this on. I haven’t… well, I haven’t been with anyone for quite some time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Wartick. It’s helpful to have those details. A yellowish discharge with an odor is certainly something we need to investigate. And it's good you've been keeping things clean. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe if there's any discomfort—burning, itching, or pain—associated with the discharge?
PATIENT: Well, no burning, exactly. But it is… irritating. A constant sort of… unpleasantness. And sometimes a bit of itching. Not terribly severe, mind you, but enough to be… bothersome. It’s most noticeable after… after I’ve been… well, after I’ve used the facilities, if you understand. It’s just… not dignified, Doctor. Really, a woman my age shouldn't have to be dealing with this. I always prided myself on being… clean.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable in this situation, and you’re not alone. The irritation and itching, especially after using the restroom, are important clues. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the discharge and irritation?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no aches… nothing like that. Just… this. It’s not affecting my appetite, thankfully. And I’m still sleeping alright. I just… I keep worrying about what it is, you see. Is it something… serious? I read things online, and honestly, it frightens me. It’s probably nothing, but one can’t be too careful, can one? I’ve always been very… cautious.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you haven’t experienced any other symptoms like fever or changes in your appetite, that’s reassuring. And you’re right to be cautious, and it’s understandable to be concerned, especially with information available online. We'll figure this out together. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright with you. Have you had any previous vaginal infections or sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, that’s… rather personal, isn’t it? I haven’t… I haven’t ever really spoken about this with a doctor before. In my day, ladies didn't discuss these things. But… I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? No, I haven’t had any… infections, as such. Not that I know of. I was very careful, you see. Very, very careful. I had a… a brief engagement many years ago, but it didn't amount to anything. And after that… well, I’ve been on my own. It’s just… this is all so unsettling. I really don't understand how this could have happened.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Wartick. It's perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable discussing these things, and I appreciate you sharing this information with me. It's helpful to know that you haven't had any previous infections. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or medical conditions, such as diabetes or a weakened immune system?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. I’m very proud of that, actually. And no diabetes, thank goodness. My mother had it, a very nasty business. I eat very healthily, you see. Lots of vegetables, not too much sugar. And… no, my immune system has always been quite strong, as far as I know. I rarely get sick. A little cold now and then, but nothing serious. I’ve been very fortunate, health-wise. This… this is a complete anomaly. I just hope it’s nothing… embarrassing. Or contagious. That would be dreadful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Wartick. A strong medical history is very helpful. It sounds like you've taken very good care of your health. To rule out any potential causes and get a definitive diagnosis, I would like to perform a quick physical exam. This will involve a visual inspection and potentially taking a small sample for testing. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… a physical exam? Oh dear. I haven’t had one of those in… goodness, decades. Is it… necessary, Doctor? I mean, couldn’t we just… prescribe something? Perhaps an ointment? I’m not comfortable with being… examined. It’s just… a bit much. I really don’t understand why it’s required. I’ve told you everything, haven’t I? And I’m very careful about hygiene. Surely that counts for something.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Wartick, and I absolutely respect your discomfort. You're right, you have provided me with a great deal of information, which is very helpful. However, to accurately determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment, a physical exam is really the best course of action. It will help me rule out other possibilities and confirm a diagnosis. The exam is quite straightforward, and I will explain every step before I do it. We can take things at your pace, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. It’s important to remember that this is a private and confidential setting, and my priority is your comfort and well-being. We can start with a visual inspection, and if you're comfortable, we can collect a small sample for testing. If you'd prefer, we can start with just the visual inspection and see how you feel. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… a visual inspection… I suppose that’s… less intrusive. Yes, alright. A visual inspection. But no… no collecting anything. Not today, at least. And please, Doctor, be gentle. And… explain everything beforehand. I really dislike surprises. And if it’s… if it’s something unpleasant, please just tell me plainly. I’d rather know. I don't want to be left wondering. This is all rather… distressing, you see. I haven’t felt this… vulnerable in years.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Wartick. We'll proceed entirely at your pace and with your comfort in mind. We will start with just the visual inspection. I will explain every step before I do it, and you can stop me at any time. I will be as gentle as possible, and I promise to be straightforward with you about what I see. To begin, I'll just have you lie down on the examination table, with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll use a light to gently examine the external area. This will allow me to look for any signs of irritation, inflammation, or discharge. It will be quick and painless. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, I suppose. But… must I really lie down? Couldn't I just… lean forward? I find it difficult to get up and down these days, you see. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And please, Doctor, be quick about it. I really don’t want to be here any longer than necessary. It’s… unsettling, this whole process. Very unsettling. And please, try not to make any… comments. Just tell me if you see anything. Plainly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. You are absolutely right to express your concerns, and I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable. We can definitely do this while you're seated. There's no need to lie down if that's more comfortable for you. I will simply ask you to lean forward slightly so I can get a good look. I will explain what I'm observing as I go, and you can feel free to ask any questions. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I promise to respect your privacy. I will also refrain from making any unnecessary comments, and simply tell you what I observe, plainly and directly. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds much better. Seated is preferable. Much preferable. And… plainly, you said? No medical jargon? I dislike that terribly. I just want to know… is it something serious? Is it… contagious? And is there anything I can do to… to alleviate the irritation? That’s all I really want to know. No need for complicated explanations, just… the facts. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Wartick. I promise to use plain language and avoid any medical jargon. I will simply tell you the facts, and we’ll focus on what’s important. I'll do my best to answer your questions as clearly and concisely as possible, and we’ll focus on alleviating your irritation. Now, if you could just lean forward slightly… I’m observing some redness and mild swelling around the opening of the vagina. There is also a yellowish discharge present, as you described. It doesn’t appear to be a severe inflammation, but it is certainly something we need to address. I do not see any signs of blisters or open sores at this time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Redness and swelling… and a yellowish discharge… That’s what I’ve been experiencing. So… it’s not something… dreadful? Not a terribly serious illness? I’ve been terribly worried about… well, about everything. And no blisters or sores… that’s good, isn’t it? That means it’s… not contagious, perhaps? Oh dear, I’m rambling. I always do when I’m nervous. Is it… is it something an ointment can clear up? Please tell me it’s something simple.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns with me. Based on my examination, it appears most likely you are experiencing a case of bacterial vaginosis, or BV. It’s a common infection caused by an imbalance of bacteria naturally present in the vagina. It’s not a sexually transmitted infection, so it is not contagious. And thankfully, it is usually very treatable. It’s often not serious, but it can be uncomfortable, as you've experienced. An ointment may provide some relief, but typically, we treat BV with a course of oral antibiotics or a vaginal cream. To be certain, I’d like to send a small sample of the discharge to the lab for testing. This will confirm the diagnosis and help me determine the best course of treatment for you. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Bacterial vaginosis… An imbalance of bacteria… That sounds… less dreadful than I imagined. And not contagious… that’s a relief. A great relief. Oral antibiotics… or vaginal cream… I… I suppose I prefer the cream, if possible. I dislike taking pills. They always upset my stomach. A small sample… yes, alright. If it will help determine the best treatment… yes. But please, Doctor, be gentle. And explain everything beforehand. I really dislike surprises. And if it’s… uncomfortable… just tell me plainly. No need for elaborate explanations, just… the facts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Wartick. We will use the vaginal cream, if possible. And I promise to be as gentle as possible during the sample collection. To collect the sample, I'll use a sterile swab to gently collect a small amount of discharge from inside the vagina. It may feel slightly uncomfortable, like a brief pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. It will only take a few seconds. I’ll walk you through each step and explain everything as I go. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, I suppose I’m ready. But please, Doctor… go slowly. And explain everything beforehand. And if it’s… uncomfortable… just tell me. No need for false reassurances. I just want to get this over with. And please, be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be. This whole experience is… unsettling. Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. We will go as slowly as you need, and I will explain every step. I promise to be gentle, and I'll tell you if you might feel any discomfort. First, I'm going to ask you to lean back slightly on the examination table. Then, I’ll gently insert the swab into your vagina, just a few centimeters. It may feel like a brief pressure, or a slight tickle. You may feel a bit of discomfort, but it should be minimal. If you feel any sharp pain, please let me know immediately, and I will stop. I'll gently rotate the swab to collect a small sample, and then quickly remove it. It will only take a few seconds. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, let’s get it over with. Quickly, please. And gently… please remember gently. I really dislike this… this whole experience. It’s… humiliating, frankly. And if you feel anything… anything at all… just tell me. Don’t hesitate. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick, we're finished. That was very quick. You did wonderfully. That's all we need for now. I'll send this sample to the lab, and we should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a topical cream called metronidazole. It's a common treatment for bacterial vaginosis, and it should help relieve your symptoms. Are there any other questions or concerns I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… topical cream… Alright. That’s good. That’s… a relief. No pills, thankfully. And… no, I think that’s all. Just… please, can you just confirm again that it’s not… contagious? And that it’s… treatable? I just want to be certain. And perhaps… perhaps you could suggest something for the irritation? It’s terribly uncomfortable, you see. Something I can purchase at the pharmacy?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Wartick. Let me confirm for you one more time. Bacterial vaginosis is not a sexually transmitted infection, so it is not contagious. And thankfully, it is usually very treatable with the metronidazole cream. For the irritation, I recommend using a gentle, unscented moisturizer like a plain petroleum jelly or a cream specifically designed for sensitive vaginal skin. You can find these at any pharmacy. Avoid douches, scented soaps, or feminine hygiene sprays, as these can further irritate the area. Sitz baths with warm water can also provide some relief. Here's your prescription for the metronidazole cream, and this handout provides more information about bacterial vaginosis, how to use the cream, and tips for managing your symptoms. Do you have any other questions before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… you’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate that. It's just… it’s not easy discussing these things. Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Wartick. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after you've started the treatment. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a speedy recovery. Have a good day as well.
