DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s mostly just… paperwork, I think? The nice lady on the phone said I needed some lab work done. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don't really recall why exactly. Something about checking things, I suppose. I just want to get it over with, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. That's perfectly alright. We do routine annual labs for patients on Medicare, and it sounds like this is likely that. It’s good you came in. I can certainly review the reason for the labs with you and we’ll get everything taken care of. To start, do you have any current symptoms you’ve been experiencing – anything at all that’s been bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but that's just old age, isn't it? And my knees ache when it rains… but that's been happening for years. Nothing new, nothing… worrying. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. Honestly, I’m probably wasting your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not wasting my time at all, Mr. Croonquist. It’s important to check in, even if you’re feeling generally well. And it's helpful to know about things like the knee pain, even if it’s chronic. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, so it's good you mentioned it. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you mind if I ask about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That’s a tough one. I’ve seen a few doctors in my time, you know? Lived a long life. I had something with my… gallbladder, a long time ago. Had it taken out. And… there was something with my blood pressure, maybe? They put me on pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. I can't really remember all the details. It was years ago, and honestly, I don’t keep track of things like that. Does that help? I wish I was more organized.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Gallbladder removal and some history of high blood pressure – I’m making notes of that. Do you remember approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. Must have been… the 1980s, maybe? Or early 90s? I was living in… Kabul then, I think. Everything gets blurry after a while, you know? I was younger, definitely. And thinner! It was a small hospital, not fancy. They did a good job, though. I recovered quickly enough. I really wish I could recall more specifics, but my memory is just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. The 1980s or early 90s is helpful. And it’s good to know you recovered well. Now, are there any other past surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not that I recall. I broke my arm once when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that wasn’t a hospital stay, just a cast. And I had some dental work done over the years, of course, but nothing major. I think that’s it, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I haven't needed to spend much time in hospitals, thankfully. Is this taking too long? I have an appointment later, you see.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. You’re doing great. And you have been lucky, it sounds like. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to the lab work. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that went away years ago. I eat pretty much anything, never had a reaction to food. And no known drug allergies, to my knowledge. I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, and never had any problems. I think I'm pretty clear on that front. Though, to be honest, I don't always remember the names of the medications…
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped. I don’t think I’m taking anything right now. Oh, wait! My neighbor gave me some fish oil capsules a few months ago, said it was good for my joints. I’ve been taking those on and off, but it’s not regular. Just when I remember. And sometimes I take an aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s it. Really, that’s it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fish oil capsules occasionally and aspirin as needed. Good. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I really do have that appointment later.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 142/88, slightly elevated. Ears are clear, tympanic membranes intact. Throat is clear, no visible inflammation or lesions. Everything sounds and looks good so far, Mr. Croonquist. Your blood pressure is a bit high, but we can discuss that further. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to order some routine blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. That sounds… fine. The more you check, the better, I suppose. I just… don't like needles. But if it’s necessary… then go ahead. Is it going to take long? And will I need to fast beforehand? I had a late breakfast, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about needles, Mr. Croonquist. It will only take a few minutes. And yes, for the most accurate results, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. Since you had a late breakfast, we’ll need to reschedule the blood work for tomorrow morning. You can have water, but no food or sugary drinks. I’ll have the lab technician schedule you for 8:00 AM tomorrow. In the meantime, we'll discuss your slightly elevated blood pressure and monitor it at your next appointment. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that’s much better. 8:00 AM is fine. Fasting… I can manage that. Water, yes. Good. And you’ll talk to me about my blood pressure later? That's good. I appreciate that. Well, I think that’s everything for today, isn’t it? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man with a bad memory. I really need to get going now. That appointment… it’s important.
