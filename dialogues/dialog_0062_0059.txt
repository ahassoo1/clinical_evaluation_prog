DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome! I’m Dr. Decosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about my speech, I suppose. It’s been… a bit off. Hard to explain, really. I just… stumble over my words sometimes. It’s not constant, but it’s been happening more recently, and my husband thought it best to get it checked out. I don’t… fully remember when it started, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's common for things to develop gradually, and it's good your husband encouraged you to come in. "A bit off" and stumbling… can you describe what that feels like, or how it sounds when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s like… the words are there, in my head, you know? But when I try to say them, they don't always come out right. Sometimes I repeat myself, or… switch words around. It’s not a full mess, just… a little jumbled. I don’t feel different when it happens, if that makes sense. No numbness or anything. Just… the words aren’t cooperating. It's probably silly, honestly.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Adyn. It's good you're able to articulate that it feels like the words aren’t flowing correctly, and that you don't have any other neurological symptoms like numbness. That helps me narrow things down. And you said it’s been happening more recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It… it feels like it’s gotten worse in the last few weeks, maybe a month? Before that, it was just… very occasional. Like once in a blue moon. Now… it’s almost daily, though not every time I speak. It's… frustrating, mostly. I work in construction, you see, and clear communication is… important.
DOCTOR: I understand. Construction definitely requires clear communication – that’s a good observation on your part. And the fact that it's become more frequent in the last month is useful information. Just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed it happening more in specific situations?
PATIENT: That's a good question… Hmm. Thinking about it… I think it's worse when I'm tired. Definitely worse after a long day on the job site. And… if I’m trying to explain something complicated, it seems to trip me up more. When I’m just chatting normally, it’s less frequent. Though, like I said, it still happens. I don’t… know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Adyn. That pattern – worse with fatigue and complex explanations – is helpful. Okay, let’s talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have… well, my husband handles most of the doctor's appointments, so I don’t always remember everything. I do have… I think it’s mild hypertension, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. And… I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but I’ve fully recovered from that. Other than that… not that I recall. I take a daily multivitamin, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild hypertension, well-controlled with medication, and a history of bronchitis – good to know. And the multivitamin is helpful information too. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… I believe it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. My husband picks up the refills, and I just take it every morning. He’s very organised, bless him. I’m not very good at remembering names of things, I'm afraid. I know it’s a small white pill.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Adyn. Lisinopril is a common medication for hypertension. And it's great that your blood pressure is well-controlled. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. My husband always asks when we’re at the pharmacy, and they haven’t noted anything down. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven't had any issues with insect bites or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies – that’s good. And you mentioned you work in construction. Do you use any protective equipment, like earplugs or earmuffs?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Safety is very important on site, you know. We’re required to wear ear protection whenever we’re operating heavy machinery. I use earmuffs most of the time. They’re quite bulky, but they do the job. And a hard hat, of course. Always a hard hat.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how long have you been working in construction, and have you been consistently using ear protection for the duration of that time?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I’ve been in construction for… about five years now. And yes, we’ve always been required to use ear protection. The site supervisors are very strict about it. It’s drilled into us during training. I suppose… I’ve been using them consistently since I started, yes. Though… sometimes they’re uncomfortable after a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good to know. And before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a tough one. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn't know my father. I have an aunt in Jamaica, but I haven’t seen her in years. I don’t… really know much about anyone else’s medical history. I think my mother had high blood pressure, but that’s just what I vaguely remember hearing. I’m not very close to any relatives, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Adyn. It’s alright if you don’t have a lot of information about your family history. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure is helpful, though. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I’m a little nervous, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax as much as possible. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, everything sounds clear on both sides. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’m just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll check your coordination. Your coordination seems fine as well. No obvious signs of weakness or imbalance. One last thing: I’m going to quickly check your ears. Okay, your ear canals appear clear. Everything looks normal on the surface.
PATIENT: That… wasn’t so bad. Thank you, Doctor. Is everything alright? You seem to be… thinking.
DOCTOR: Everything appears normal, Adyn. However, given your speech pattern, the fact it’s worsening with fatigue, and your consistent use of ear protection, I want to explore a few possibilities. It's unlikely, but we need to rule out any potential inner ear issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. Also, it’s important to consider the possibility of early-onset occupational noise exposure effects. To be thorough, I'd like to order an audiological evaluation—a hearing test—to get a baseline reading of your hearing. And I'm also going to recommend a referral to a speech-language pathologist for a comprehensive assessment. They can evaluate your speech and identify any underlying issues. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it rules things out, all the better. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? A hearing test and seeing a speech therapist… I can definitely do that. Will the doctor’s office help me schedule those appointments? And… will my insurance cover them?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Adyn. We’ll handle scheduling both appointments for you. Our office staff is very experienced with insurance pre-authorization and will verify your coverage with Medicare before scheduling. They’ll let you know if there are any out-of-pocket costs. I’ll also write a referral for the speech-language pathologist, and a requisition for the audiological evaluation. We typically recommend a full comprehensive assessment to start. To summarize: we're going to rule out hearing loss and speech pathology issues. If both are clear, then we'll re-evaluate and explore other possibilities, such as potential neurological causes – though, given your exam and history, that's less likely at this point. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very thorough plan, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel much more reassured, knowing we're being proactive. Thank you. I suppose… just let me know when and where I need to go for those appointments, and I’ll be there.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could reassure you. Our office will call you within the next two business days to schedule the appointments. We’ll provide all the necessary information – location, date, time, and any preparation instructions. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience any dizziness, double vision, weakness, or severe headaches – please contact us immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. But otherwise, we'll see you after the tests are completed. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. You’ve been very helpful. I'll wait for the phone call, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and please get some rest.
