DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I requested this lab panel myself, actually. I just turned seventy-four last month, and my wife, bless her heart, she insists I keep a close eye on things. Nothing specific is wrong, you understand. Just… a general check-up, a bit of preventative maintenance, as it were. I like to know what’s going on under the hood, so to speak.
DOCTOR: I see. A proactive approach. That’s… commendable, though generally these panels are ordered when there’s a clinical indication. Still. You requested a comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a complete blood count, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is precisely right. My wife, Elena, she did some research, and those seemed to be the things one ought to be looking at at my age. She’s very thorough, my Elena. I trust her judgment implicitly. And, well, if I’m being honest, I was curious myself. It's good to have a baseline, isn't it? Knowing what’s normal for me, should anything… change in the future.
DOCTOR: A baseline, yes. Though “normal” varies considerably from person to person. We’ll have something to compare to, certainly. Now, have you been experiencing any symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, Doctor, not really. I feel… quite well, all things considered. Perhaps a little stiffness in my knees in the mornings, but that’s just age, I suppose. And I tire a bit more easily when I’m working, but construction work is demanding, even for a younger man. Nothing alarming, certainly nothing that would bring me to the doctor if Elena hadn’t prompted this. I eat well, I sleep reasonably well… honestly, I’m a pretty simple man with simple needs.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the knees… and fatigue. Okay. And how long have you been noticing this increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s been… gradual, I suppose. Maybe the last six months or so? It’s not debilitating, Doctor. I still go to work every day, I still help around the house… it’s just that at the end of the day, I feel a bit more… depleted than I used to. It used to be I’d come home and still have energy to putter around in the garden. Now, I mostly just want to sit and relax. Nothing dramatic, you understand. Just… a lessening.
DOCTOR: A lessening. Right. Do you notice any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been a bit more thirsty lately. I always drink plenty of water, but I seem to be reaching for the glass more often than usual. And… this is a bit embarrassing, but I’ve had to get up a couple of times during the night to… relieve myself. That hasn't happened in years. I assumed it was just a change in the weather, honestly. It’s been quite humid.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and nocturia… That’s… pertinent information, Mr. Mombrun. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thankfully, no. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man. A little arthritis in my hands, the doctor told me years ago, but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything major, and I don’t take any regular medications… just the occasional ibuprofen for a sore muscle after a long day at work. My blood pressure has always been good, at least when the nurse checks it at the doctor’s office. It sometimes spikes a bit when I’m nervous, but it always comes back down. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Good genes, I reckon. My mother lived to be ninety-five, and my father, eighty-eight.
DOCTOR: No history of chronic illness… excellent. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, actually. When I was quite young, maybe ten years old, I had my tonsils removed. And… oh, yes. About twenty years ago, I had a small piece of glass removed from my hand after an accident at the construction site. Nothing major, just a local anesthetic and a few stitches. No complications either time, thankfully. Other than that, nothing. I’ve always been careful at work, you see. Safety first. Though accidents do happen, as they say.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, foreign body removal… all right. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, family history. My mother’s side… there was a great-aunt who had diabetes, I believe. And my father’s brother, he had heart trouble later in life. But generally, my family is quite robust. Lots of long lifespans, as I mentioned before. My wife, Elena, she keeps very detailed records, you see. She’s always been very concerned about our health, even before this. She's got a chart for everything! She'll likely remind me of something I’ve forgotten in a moment, I suspect. But to the best of my knowledge, those are the most significant issues.
DOCTOR: Okay. And your social history, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, as I said, I’m a construction laborer. I’ve been doing that for… oh, nearly forty years now. It’s hard work, but honest work. I enjoy it, mostly. I live with my wife, Elena, as I mentioned. We’ve been married for forty-two years, a blessing, truly. We don’t have any children. I used to enjoy fishing, but my knees don’t allow me to get around as easily these days. I don’t smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two on a weekend. Nothing excessive. And… I believe that covers most of it. A simple life, Doctor, a simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. And finally, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with insect bites or anything like that. Elena always double-checks when we try new foods, just to be safe, but I’ve never given her cause for concern. I'm a pretty straightforward man, you see. Not much to worry about with me. Though, perhaps this tiredness is something to worry about. That's why I'm here, after all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a brief neurological assessment. I’d also like to palpate your abdomen and check your reflexes. It’s standard procedure, but given your symptoms, I want to get a more complete picture. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment implicitly. Palpate away, listen as you need to. I'm a simple man, as I said, and I have no objections whatsoever. I just want to know what’s going on, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. Though I doubt it will.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, if you'll just sit here. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not dramatically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Neurological exam is unremarkable. Overall, the physical exam is relatively normal, but the elevated blood pressure and your reported symptoms warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, in a way, Doctor. That nothing obvious is amiss. Though I must admit, I'm a bit concerned about the blood pressure. My wife will likely have something to say about that. What sort of investigation are you thinking of? Is it something serious? I understand you can't give definitive answers yet, but a general idea would be helpful. Perhaps blood work? Elena mentioned something about a fasting glucose test…
DOCTOR: You are correct, blood work is the next step. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – that will assess your kidney function, liver function, and electrolytes – and a fasting glucose test, as your wife suggested. We’ll also check your lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. And given the elevated blood pressure, I'd like to have a urinalysis performed to rule out any kidney issues. The urinalysis and blood work will help us to determine the cause of your symptoms and assess your overall health. The elevated blood pressure is concerning, but it’s often manageable with lifestyle changes or medication, if necessary. We need to understand why it's elevated first. I don't want to jump to conclusions. But given your symptoms of increased thirst and nocturia, we should also rule out diabetes as a possibility. It’s important to be thorough. I'm not suggesting anything serious at this point, Mr. Mombrun, but these tests will give us the information we need to make an informed decision about your care. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… very sensible, Doctor. Thorough, as you say. I appreciate your cautious approach. And yes, absolutely acceptable. I trust your judgment completely. I’m happy to have whatever tests you deem necessary. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not what I want to know. And… just to be clear, what does “fasting” entail? Elena is quite particular about these things, and I don’t want to accidentally ruin the results by having a biscuit with my coffee. She’ll never let me live it down.
DOCTOR: A very good question, Mr. Mombrun. And a wise one to ask. "Fasting" means that you should not eat or drink anything – except water – for eight to twelve hours before the blood draw. No biscuits, no coffee, no juice. Just water. It’s important because food and drink can significantly affect the results of the glucose test and other blood work. We’ll schedule the blood draw for first thing in the morning, so you can have dinner as usual tonight and then refrain from eating or drinking after that. I’ll give you a written list of instructions, just to be sure. Elena sounds like a very meticulous woman, and it's best to be certain. I'll also give you a referral to the lab. They are quite efficient, and the phlebotomists are very skilled. It should be a quick and painless procedure. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable. Dinner tonight, then nothing until tomorrow morning. I can certainly handle that. And a written list is a very good idea. Elena will appreciate that, I assure you. She likes things in writing. And… one more question, if you don't mind. How long will it take to get the results? I know you’re busy, and I don't want to pester you, but I imagine I’ll be worrying about it. Is it a matter of days? Weeks? Just a rough estimate would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Here you are. All the details are outlined here, including the fasting requirements and the lab’s contact information. As for the results, typically it takes between three to five business days for the lab to process the blood work and send the results to me. Once I receive them, I’ll review them carefully and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a plan. I understand your concern, Mr. Mombrun, and I will do my best to expedite the process. I know waiting can be stressful, but it’s important to have accurate information before making any decisions. If you have any questions in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. We'll get you scheduled for a follow up as soon as I have the results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Three to five business days. I can certainly manage that. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. You’ve put my mind at ease, honestly. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. I’ll be sure to follow the instructions carefully and contact the lab to schedule the blood draw. Thank you for your time and your patience, Doctor. I truly appreciate it. And please, if you think of anything else I should be aware of, don’t hesitate to contact me. Elena would insist on it, you see. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. And rest assured, if anything comes to mind, my office will contact you. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And do try to get some rest. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun.
