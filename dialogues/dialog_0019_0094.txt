DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um… hi. My husband… he said I should come. Something about… learning? I don't really remember what he said exactly. He just said the doctor needs to… talk to me. Is this a long visit? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can take things at your pace. It sounds like your husband is looking out for you, wanting to make sure you're feeling your best. It doesn’t have to be long at all. We’ll just chat a bit, see how you're doing. Perhaps we can start with just… generally, how have you been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Like… okay, I guess. I work a lot. Sheet metal… it's hard work. My back hurts sometimes, but that's normal, right? Everyone at work complains about their back. I don't know what you want me to say. I don't get sick often, if that's what you mean. Mostly just tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Tiredness is… common, especially with physically demanding work. And back pain with sheet metal work?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. It's… bending and lifting, all day. And the metal is heavy. My husband keeps telling me to be careful, but… you have to get the job done, right? He worries too much. He always has. Is this about my back? Because if it is, I don't need anything done to it. Just tired. I told you.
DOCTOR: Right, right. So, the tiredness is the biggest thing bothering you right now, and the back pain is just… part of the job. It sounds like you’re very dedicated to your work. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Dedicated? I have to pay the bills! It’s not like I enjoy being sore all the time. Tiredness… hmm. It’s just… always there. Even when I sleep. I go to bed early, but I don’t feel rested when I wake up. It’s hard to explain. Like… dragging yourself through mud all day, even before work. And then work makes it worse. I don't know what else to tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds… really draining. “Dragging yourself through mud” is a good way to put it. It’s more than just being physically tired from work, it sounds like. Now, sometimes feeling that way can be related to a lot of things. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I don’t know. Everything’s pretty much the same. Work, home, sleep, repeat. My hair is falling out a little more, maybe? But everyone says that happens when you get older. I’m 33, is that old? And I’ve been… a little more grumpy, I guess. My husband said so. He’s always noticing things. Honestly, I don't know what you want me to tell you. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: No, we're just trying to get a complete picture, Airam. You’re not doing anything wrong. Hair loss and being a bit more irritable can happen for lots of reasons. It’s good your husband is paying attention, and it’s helpful that you noticed it too. Do you have any trouble sleeping besides not feeling rested?
PATIENT: Trouble… like, can't fall asleep? No, I fall asleep okay. It's just… staying asleep. I wake up a lot. Maybe once or twice a night. Sometimes I can get back to sleep, sometimes I just… lie there. Thinking about work, usually. Bills. Things like that. My husband doesn't notice when I get up, he snores really loudly. It’s annoying. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Waking up during the night, even if you can sometimes get back to sleep… that can definitely contribute to feeling tired all the time. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other things, just to make sure we aren't missing anything. Have you noticed any changes in your weight lately?
PATIENT: Weight? I don't know. I haven’t really been… weighing myself. I eat okay, I guess. Not fancy food, just… normal things. Rice, noodles, some meat. My husband cooks mostly. He worries about me eating enough. I think I've… maybe gained a little weight? My clothes feel a little tighter. But it could be the laundry, he shrinks everything. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. Is this about my weight? Because I'm not… overweight.
DOCTOR: No, we're not focusing on that specifically. Just trying to get a complete picture. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm. It's dry, I guess. Always has been. The factory air… it's not good for your skin. I use lotion sometimes, but I forget. I have… a little patch, on my arm. It's been there a long time. Nothing new. It doesn’t itch or anything. My mother had something similar. She said it was just… old age. Is everything about old age with you people? I'm only 33.
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. It sounds like you've been dealing with dry skin for a while, and it’s good that you're aware of the patch on your arm. Now, have you noticed any unusual fatigue, like extreme tiredness that doesn’t get better with rest?
PATIENT: Extreme tiredness… well, isn't all my tiredness extreme? I feel tired all the time. Like I told you. Even on weekends. Even when I sleep for ten hours. It doesn’t… go away. It’s just… always there. It's annoying. I used to have more energy. Before… well, I don’t know. It’s just… things have been different lately. Everything is harder. Is this getting somewhere? I have a hair appointment later.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere, Airam. It sounds like this has been building up for a while. Just a couple more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What does that mean? Are you asking me about… going to the bathroom? This is ridiculous. Why are you asking me about this? I don't talk about these things with strangers! My husband… he would be so embarrassed if he knew you were asking me this. This is a waste of my time. I'm leaving. This is enough. I need to go.
DOCTOR: I am so sorry, Airam. You’re absolutely right, that was inappropriate of me to ask without explaining. I apologize. Sometimes, changes in bowel habits can be a sign of certain medical conditions, and I was trying to be thorough. But you're right, that's a very personal question, and I should have explained it better. Please, don't feel pressured to answer anything you're not comfortable with. I think, given everything you’ve told me… the persistent tiredness, the interrupted sleep, the hair loss, the irritability… I’d like to order some blood tests. Just to rule out a few possibilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? What for? I don't like needles. And what possibilities are you talking about? I just feel tired! Isn't that all? My husband will be furious if I have to go to a lab. He worries about everything. I… I don’t know. I don’t like this. I just wanted to learn something, like he said. This is too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re right. This is a lot. Let's take a step back. The blood tests are just to help us understand what might be causing the tiredness. Things like iron levels, thyroid function, and vitamin deficiencies can sometimes cause that. If you're really not comfortable with the tests right now, we don't have to do them. Perhaps we can start with some simple lifestyle changes?
