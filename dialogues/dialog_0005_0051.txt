DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my blood, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I should come get it checked. Something about needing to know my type. For… things. I can’t quite recall what things, now. It's been a busy few months, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. “Things.” Well, knowing your blood type is always a good idea, regardless. It can be important for several reasons. Just to clarify, is this because of a recent event or just a general concern your daughter raised?
PATIENT: Oh, no event, dear. Nothing like that, thankfully. Just… she's very thorough, my daughter. Always thinking ahead. She said it was just good to have on file, in case… well, you know. For when I get older, I suppose. It's not bothering me, not at all. Just trying to be… responsible, I guess. Does that make sense? It's a bit hazy, honestly.
DOCTOR: It does, Mrs. Nini. Though, frankly, at 79, a routine blood type check isn’t typically standard unless there’s a specific reason. But we can certainly do it if it will put your daughter’s mind at ease. Have you ever had your blood type tested before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a good question. I’ve had a lot of doctor visits over the years, you see. Working as a rigger… well, it wasn’t always the safest job. But I really don't remember anyone telling me my type. Not specifically. Maybe they did, and I just forgot. It's like trying to recall a dream, sometimes. Everything feels… distant. I wouldn't be surprised either way, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look and see if anything is documented in your records here at the clinic. Just one moment… Hmm. No record of a blood type test. Okay. We can certainly get one done now. It's a simple blood draw. Aside from this blood type check, are you experiencing any other symptoms or have any other health concerns we should discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness it doesn't seem to be in there. And no, dear, nothing really bothering me. A bit of stiffness in the mornings, like most folks my age, but nothing I can't work through. My memory isn't what it used to be, of course, but that’s just getting old, I suppose. Honestly, that's the biggest thing. And my daughter worries, naturally. She’s a good girl. So, a blood draw… that doesn’t sound too bad, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t. It’s very quick. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel while we're at it, just to get a general overview of your kidney function and blood sugar. It’s standard practice. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Though, I haven't taken much in the way of medicine lately. I prefer to let things heal on their own, if possible. But no, I don’t think so. No allergies to speak of. Though... my daughter mentioned something about a rash a long time ago, maybe from a cleaning product? Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. Is that important?
DOCTOR: A rash could be relevant. Was it a severe reaction?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not severe. Just a little… itchy. It went away on its own after a day or two. My daughter always overreacts a little, you see. She's very cautious. It wasn't anything to worry about, I assure you. Really. It was years ago, too. I don’t even remember what caused it, exactly. Just… a bit of a rash. My daughter made me stop using the cleaner, though. She's a good girl. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's proceed with the blood draw. We'll take a small sample and send it off to the lab. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly sensible, dear. A listen and a quick look… no trouble at all. Yes, please do. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, I can’t quite recall, actually. A few days for the results? That’s no problem. I’m not in any rush, you see. Take your time. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Though, honestly, at my age, I mostly just try to stay out of trouble!
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just relax. I'll need you to remove your shoes and socks, and I’ll have you lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Shoes and socks off, you say? No problem at all. It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it? But I suppose that’s to be expected. A bit of a draft. Lie down, you say? Yes, yes, of course. Just let me shuffle over here… getting a little slow these days, you see. Now, just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little slow, but otherwise regular. Lungs sound clear, but a little diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes, consistent with age. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Breathing normally… that’s easy enough. Clear lungs, you say? That’s good to hear. I always try to take a deep breath of fresh air when I can. Diminished sounds… well, I suppose that’s to be expected, at my age. Feel the abdomen… yes, all right. No tenderness… not that I’m aware of, no. Just a bit… well, it’s a bit sensitive sometimes, if I eat too much. But nothing to worry about, really. Just an old lady’s tummy!
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant masses or tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, but a little bit full. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, bowel habits… well, now you’re asking! Changes… hmm. Not that I’ve really noticed, no. It’s all a bit… unpredictable, you see. Comes and goes as it pleases! It’s just part of getting old, isn’t it? Everything slows down. I don’t worry about it too much, to be honest. Just a bit… sluggish sometimes. My daughter, she always wants me to drink more water, though. She says it helps. Is that important? Are you worried about something?
DOCTOR: No, not worried, Mrs. Nini. Just gathering information. Okay. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your legs, and I'll tap a few places on your knees and ankles.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Reflexes, you say? Tap on the knees and ankles… sounds perfectly sensible. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m a bit ticklish, you know! Though, I suppose you’re a doctor, so you’ll be gentle. Just tap away, dear. No rush. Is there anything else I need to do? Though, honestly, at my age, it’s mostly just remembering where I put my glasses!
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little slow, but present. That’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs again. Everything still sounds clear, but I do detect a very faint murmur. Nothing to be alarmed about, but it's something to keep an eye on. It could be related to age, or something else entirely. We’ll monitor it. Now, we’ll get that blood draw done. It should only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, a murmur, you say? A faint murmur… hmm. I don't think I've ever heard of that before. Is that bad? My daughter always says I need to take better care of my heart. She worries terribly, you see. But everything sounds clear, you say? That's good to hear. And it could just be my age? Well, as long as it’s not too serious. Blood draw, you say? Yes, yes, go ahead. I'm mostly just glad we're getting everything checked out. It's good to know what's going on, isn't it? Though, honestly, at my age, I mostly just try to take things one day at a time.
DOCTOR: <stage>I call in the phlebotomist. "Okay, Mrs. Nini, I'm going to have the phlebotomist come in and draw some blood. It will only take a few minutes. After that, we’ll discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a phlebotomist, you say? A blood draw… yes, yes. No questions at the moment, dear. I mostly just trust your judgment. You seem very knowledgeable. But… …would you say I seem to be… remembering things alright? My daughter has been a bit worried about my memory, you see. Just… is everything okay up here? It's just… sometimes things slip my mind, and I worry it’s more than just old age.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Nini, your memory seems a little… diminished, but that is not uncommon at your age. You are oriented to person and place, and you are able to carry on a conversation. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things, especially with age. But, if you're truly concerned, we can do a quick cognitive assessment during a follow-up visit. It's a simple test that can help us get a better understanding of your memory function. Would you like me to schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Oh, a cognitive assessment? A test… yes, yes. That sounds… sensible, I suppose. If it will put my daughter’s mind at ease, then yes, please. She worries so terribly, you see. If it shows everything is alright, then that would be wonderful. And if it shows… well, then we’ll know what to do, won't we? Yes, please schedule it for me. Just… don't make it too complicated, dear. My brain isn't what it used to be! Now, let’s get that blood draw done. The sooner we know, the better, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll schedule you for a cognitive assessment in about two weeks. It's a very simple test, nothing to worry about. And the phlebotomist is here now. Alright, Mrs. Nini, the nurse will get your blood draw done. Afterwards, I’ll have you change back into your clothes, and we’ll be all finished. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Two weeks sounds perfectly sensible. No, dear, no questions at the moment. Just… be gentle, please. I don’t like needles very much. And thank you for being so patient with me. I do tend to ramble a bit, don’t I? But it's good to know you’re here to listen. Now, let's get this over with. The sooner it's done, the better, isn’t it? .
