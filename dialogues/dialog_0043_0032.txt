DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it's… a rather embarrassing matter. Something a man doesn’t typically discuss with… well, anyone, really. My wife insisted, of course. She said it couldn’t be ignored. There's… a discharge. An unpleasant one, I assure you. I haven't the slightest idea why it's happening, and frankly, I don’t want to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. These things can be difficult to discuss, and you’ve done the right thing by coming in. It's good of you to prioritize your health, and I assure you, I’m here to help, and this is a safe space. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. To start, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well, it’s… fluid. Not… pleasant smelling, I’ll tell you that much. A bit yellowish, I suppose. And there’s… some discomfort. Not excruciating, mind you, but… noticeable. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I couldn’t say exactly. A week? Perhaps longer. My wife handles most of those details, you see. I simply… noticed it. It's most bothersome after… well, after being intimate with my wife. Though it seems to happen at other times as well. Do you need a more detailed description, Doctor? It’s quite vulgar, you understand.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Krok. No detail is too small, and it’s important for me to understand everything to provide the best care. “Yellowish fluid with discomfort, occurring after intimacy, but also at other times” is helpful. Could you rate the discomfort on a scale of one to ten, with one being very mild and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: A scale, you say? Hmm. Well, it's not like a broken bone, certainly. Not the sort of pain one rushes to the hospital for. I’d say… a three, perhaps? On a good day. Sometimes it’s a little higher, maybe a four, after… exertion. But generally, it’s more of an annoyance than anything. Honestly, the embarrassment is far worse than the physical discomfort. A man doesn’t like to discuss these things, you see. It feels… undignified.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand, Mr. Krok. It takes courage to come in and discuss these issues, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. A discomfort level of three to four, sometimes higher with exertion, is good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the discharge and discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No fever, thankfully. No burning when I… relieve myself. And no swelling, as far as I can tell. My wife did mention… a bit of redness, perhaps? Around the… affected area. But I didn’t pay much attention to it. I’m not one for examining myself, you understand. I leave those sorts of things to the professionals. And no unusual odor beyond the unpleasantness of the discharge itself, if that makes any sense. It’s just… a general feeling of… uncleanliness. A most bothersome sensation, truly. Do you require any further details, Doctor? I am growing rather tired of reliving this.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Mr. Krok. “No fever, no burning sensation, redness noted by your wife, and a general feeling of uncleanliness” is all good information. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A very long life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. As for more recent conditions… my wife handles all of that as well. She insists on regular check-ups. Let me think… the doctor did mention something about my cholesterol a few years ago, said it was a little high. And I suppose I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that’s hardly a serious ailment. Oh, and I take a daily aspirin, as the doctor recommended for my heart. I believe that’s all. Honestly, I try not to dwell on these things. It only causes unnecessary worry. Are we getting closer to a solution, Doctor? This is quite… unpleasant to discuss, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, we are making progress. “Childhood illnesses, elevated cholesterol, arthritis in knees, daily aspirin for heart health” – that's very helpful to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… now that is a good question. Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, a rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… oh, yes! I had a hernia operation some years ago, perhaps twenty years ago? It was a minor procedure, thankfully. As for hospitalizations… I spent a few days in the hospital when I broke my wrist a few years back, a silly fall in the garden. Beyond that… I believe that is all. I’ve always been a relatively healthy man, you see. I’ve lived a long and active life, and I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid any serious illnesses or injuries. This… this discharge is most unusual, and rather distressing. Are we any closer to a diagnosis, Doctor? I’m growing quite weary of this conversation.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, we're gathering all the necessary information. “Appendectomy as a child, hernia repair approximately twenty years ago, wrist fracture” – thank you. Now, just a few more questions, then I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! That is… a rather indelicate question, Doctor. My wife and I have been married for… for over fifty years! A most devoted relationship, I assure you. Such a suggestion is… frankly, offensive. We have always been… discreet and faithful to one another. I find your line of questioning rather… inappropriate, Doctor. I thought you were a professional. This entire conversation is becoming increasingly unpleasant. I would prefer to skip this question altogether, if you don’t mind. It is quite unnecessary, and frankly, a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Mr. Krok. That was not my intention to offend you or your wife. It is standard medical procedure to ask about such things to rule out all possibilities, but I understand your discomfort and will absolutely respect your wishes. We will skip that question. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… yes, that I can discuss with more comfort. My father… he had a weak heart, I believe. Passed away rather suddenly when I was a young man. And my mother… she had arthritis, like myself. She suffered terribly with it in her later years. As for cancer… my sister, God rest her soul, passed away from breast cancer some years ago. And my uncle, on my mother’s side, had prostate cancer. Beyond that… I don’t recall any other significant medical conditions in my family. We weren’t a particularly… sickly family, you see. Mostly hardworking, simple folk. Are we nearing a conclusion, Doctor? I must admit, this entire experience is rather unsettling. I would like to be finished as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, we are gathering all the necessary information. “Father with heart condition, mother with arthritis, sister with breast cancer, uncle with prostate cancer” – that is helpful. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, are you currently taking any medications other than the daily aspirin?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… just the aspirin, as I mentioned. Though… my wife does give me a little something for my knees now and then. A cream, I believe. For the arthritis. A topical ointment. And sometimes, when my knees are particularly bothersome, she gives me a pill. Something for the inflammation, I think. But I don’t take it regularly. Only when needed. Honestly, my wife handles all of that. She keeps track of everything. I simply… take what she gives me. I’m not one for remembering such details. Are we finally reaching the end of this interrogation, Doctor? This is quite… exhausting.
DOCTOR: We are nearing the end, Mr. Krok. “Daily aspirin, topical cream for knees, occasional anti-inflammatory pill as prescribed by wife” - thank you. Now, if you are comfortable, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and gently examining the area of discomfort. This will help me to determine the cause of your symptoms. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Well, I suppose so. Though I must confess, I am not particularly fond of being poked and prodded. It feels… intrusive. But if it is necessary to reach a diagnosis, then I suppose I can endure it. But please be gentle, Doctor. And as quickly as possible. I am not a young man anymore, you see. And I would prefer if you explained everything you are doing beforehand. I do not like surprises. Are you certain this is absolutely necessary? Perhaps we can simply prescribe something and be done with it? This entire experience is quite… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. I assure you, I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I will explain each step before I proceed. The exam is necessary to help me determine the most likely cause of your symptoms and ensure we arrive at the correct diagnosis and treatment plan. It will not take long. First, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Now, if you could please lie back on the examination table, I’d like to gently examine the area of discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be quick about it. And as I said before, be gentle. This is not a comfortable situation, you understand. And do try to explain what you are doing. I do not appreciate surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I’m just going to gently feel around in the area of discomfort to check for any tenderness or swelling. I notice some mild tenderness on the right side, but no significant swelling. Is this where you feel the most discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s it. Right there. A bit tender, yes. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It feels… sensitive. And it’s a little warmer than the surrounding area, I believe. Honestly, I’m not particularly comfortable with this examination. It feels… intrusive. Are you finding anything of concern, Doctor? Please, tell me what you suspect. I would prefer to know the worst now rather than prolonging this ordeal. This is quite… distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok. I am being as gentle as possible. Based on my examination, there is some mild tenderness and slight warmth in the right groin area. However, there’s no obvious swelling or any hard lumps. Given your symptoms – the discharge, discomfort, tenderness, and the fact that it’s worse after intimacy – several possibilities come to mind. It could be a mild infection, a strain, or possibly an issue related to inflammation. It’s also important to rule out other potential causes. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a couple of simple tests. A urine analysis to check for infection and a blood test to look for signs of inflammation. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Tests, you say? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite… exhausting. But… I suppose if it is necessary to reach a diagnosis, then I have no choice. A urine analysis and a blood test… very well. But please, let’s get it over with quickly. I would like to be finished with this entire ordeal as soon as possible. And please, explain the process to me beforehand. I do not like surprises. Are these tests painful, Doctor? This is quite… distressing, you understand. I simply want to get back to my life, and my wife.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Krok. The tests are very simple and not painful at all. For the urine analysis, you’ll simply need to provide a sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. It’s a private process. The blood test will involve a quick prick of a vein in your arm – it’s similar to a routine check-up. A nurse will draw the sample. Once we have the results – usually within a couple of days – we can discuss the findings and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, to help alleviate your discomfort, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and wearing loose-fitting clothing. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Loose-fitting clothing… I suppose I can manage that. And avoiding strenuous activity… not a problem. I’m not exactly a marathon runner these days. A urine sample and a blood test… very well. I suppose I have one question, Doctor. What if… what if it is something serious? What if it’s… something I should be particularly worried about? My wife… she’s been very concerned. I don't want to worry her unnecessarily. And honestly, I’m not particularly fond of hospitals. Are these tests likely to reveal anything… alarming, Doctor? Please, be honest with me. This entire ordeal is quite… distressing, you understand. I simply want to know the worst, if there is a worst.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Mr. Krok. It’s natural to be concerned about the possibility of something serious. However, it’s important to remember that most of the time, these types of symptoms are not caused by anything serious. It could be a simple infection, a strain, or inflammation. The tests will help us to rule out those possibilities and determine if any further investigation is needed. If we do find something concerning, we will discuss it openly and honestly, and I will explain all of your options. We will work together to create a plan that is right for you. I want to reassure you that I am here to support you every step of the way. And I understand your concerns about hospitals. We will avoid unnecessary procedures and focus on getting you the information you need to make informed decisions. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can address any concerns you may have. Do you feel ready to proceed with the urine sample, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let’s get it over with. A urine sample… yes. The sooner we have these results, the sooner I can get back to my life. And my wife. Please, just tell me where to go. And… try to make it as quick and painless as possible. This entire ordeal is quite… distressing, you understand. I simply want it to be over. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I’ve left a cup and instructions on the counter. Take your time, and please let the nurse know if you have any trouble. Once you've collected the sample, she will draw a small amount of blood for the analysis. I'll be right here if you need anything. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. .
