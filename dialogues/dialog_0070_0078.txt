DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m hoping you can help me get…back on track. I feel like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if you will. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Not feeling quite yourself" is a good place to start. Could you elaborate on that a bit for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's…difficult to pinpoint, exactly. Just a general lack of energy, mostly. And a bit of…fogginess, you know? Like I’m wading through cotton sometimes. I used to be very…focused, very able to manage things. Now…not so much. I find myself forgetting small things, and it’s a little worrying. It’s not serious, I don’t think, but it’s definitely not me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a general lack of energy, some mental fogginess, and some difficulty with memory – small things being forgotten. And you’re concerned it’s a change from your usual self. That’s perfectly valid, and it's good you're addressing it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… It’s been gradual, honestly. I think… maybe six months ago? It started with just feeling a little more tired than usual. I chalked it up to getting older, you know? But then it slowly got worse. The fogginess came a bit after that, perhaps three or four months ago. And the forgetting… that’s the most recent, maybe within the last month or so. It’s hard to be precise, Doctor. It wasn’t a sudden thing.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty; it is often gradual. Six months of increasing fatigue, then mental fogginess three to four months ago, and increasing forgetfulness over the last month. That gives us a good timeline to work with. Now, in terms of the fatigue – would you describe it as feeling tired even after a full night’s sleep?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s a very good way to put it. Even after eight, sometimes even nine hours of sleep, I wake up feeling…not rested. Like I haven’t slept at all. I used to be able to jump out of bed and get right to work. Now, I need a good half hour, just to…gather myself. And even then, it takes effort to get going. It’s…exhausting, frankly. And it's impacting my work, a little. Not drastically, but I can’t focus for as long as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so persistent fatigue even after adequate sleep, and that’s impacting your concentration at work. That's important information. Now, shifting gears a little – have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's…a good question. I hadn't really thought about it. Let me see… my appetite has been a little off, yes. Not much of one, really. I used to enjoy cooking and eating, but lately…it feels like a chore. And I think I have lost a little weight, but it's not dramatic. Maybe five or ten pounds? I haven’t weighed myself regularly, so it’s hard to say for sure. I wouldn’t say I’m trying to lose weight, Doctor. Quite the opposite, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss, roughly five to ten pounds. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood – feeling more sad, anxious, or irritable than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I hadn’t planned to mention it, but… I’ve been more easily frustrated, definitely. Small things that wouldn’t bother me before now…irritate me. And I’m not as…patient as I used to be. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, not exactly. But I’m definitely not my usual cheerful self. My husband has noticed it, too, thankfully. He’s been very supportive. He said I seem…distant, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Pitzel. It’s important to get a complete picture. Increased irritability, a change in mood, and feeling distant, as your husband has observed. Now, just to cover some basics, have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained aches and pains?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, none of those. No fever, no chills, no night sweats. And no aches and pains that aren't just the usual wear and tear, you know? I’m getting older, so I have the occasional ache, but nothing unusual. I haven’t been sick, not a cold or the flu, nothing like that. I'm generally quite healthy, Doctor. That's why this is all so puzzling.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained pain. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've been very lucky, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My blood pressure is usually a little on the high side, my doctor has mentioned it before, but it's always been manageable with diet and exercise. Nothing requiring medication, thankfully. I've always been a very active person. I used to dance, for many years. Now, I mostly walk, but I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Okay, well controlled blood pressure, otherwise generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. And I had a C-section when my daughter was born. That was… a long time ago. Other than that, nothing. No other surgeries, no major injuries, nothing like that. I’ve always been very careful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, C-section with your daughter. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My mother had some heart problems later in life, but she lived to be eighty-five, so it wasn't too bad. My father… he had diabetes, type two, I believe. And my sister, she has arthritis, quite severely. It runs in the family, unfortunately. Otherwise, not much that I'm aware of. My family isn’t really one for talking about medical things, if you know what I mean. It’s a bit of a… taboo subject.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a few months ago. I try to get most of my nutrients from my diet. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer to try natural remedies, if possible. My husband sometimes teases me about it, says I’m a bit of a hippie, but… I just like to keep things simple. No medications at all, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Thank you for that detailed history, Ms. Pitzel. This is very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. It's standard procedure, and will help me get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Absolutely. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. A little elevated, but not significantly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Your eye movements are normal, and your balance seems stable. Thyroid is normal to palpation, no nodules. Everything appears within normal limits on this initial exam, Ms. Pitzel. However, given your symptoms of fatigue, fogginess, and forgetfulness, I think it would be wise to order some blood work. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you're feeling. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Absolutely. I trust your judgment completely. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. It's good to know everything appears normal, but I'm glad you're being thorough. Blood work sounds like a good next step. How long will it take to get the results? And will you contact me directly when they're available?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab work should take about 2-3 business days to come back. I will have the nurse contact you directly with the results as soon as they are available. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to prioritize rest and relaxation. Make sure you’re getting adequate sleep, eating a healthy diet, and staying hydrated. I know it sounds simple, but those things can make a big difference. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me so carefully and taking my concerns seriously. Two to three business days is perfectly acceptable. And I will definitely try to focus on rest and relaxation. It's been difficult lately, with everything going on, but I'll make an effort. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. I will wait for the nurse to contact me with the results.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I wish you a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon. .
