DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s my mother, actually. She… she just got diagnosed with something. Cancer, I think. And my grandmother had it too, on her side of the family. It runs in the family, you see. I want to make sure I don’t have it. Preventative measures, that sort of thing. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling is… a rather imprecise term, Mr. Theriot. While family history is relevant, it does not guarantee a diagnosis. We need to be… systematic. Your mother's diagnosis is recent, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, very. Just a few weeks ago. They… did a biopsy, I think that's what they called it. Looked at cells under a microscope. Something like that. It’s… breast cancer, if that matters. And I haven’t… I haven’t really asked a lot of questions. It’s difficult, seeing her like that. I just want to know if I need to be worried.
DOCTOR: Breast cancer in a maternal relative… Yes, that does change things, slightly. And you are seeking… screening, then?
PATIENT: Screening, yes. That’s a good way to put it. I suppose. I’m not… ill, obviously. I just want to be sure. And I'd prefer to know sooner rather than later, if you understand. It's… a lot to process, seeing my mother go through this. I don’t want that hanging over my head.
DOCTOR: Very well. Your age is 24, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Twenty-four. Is that… too young for screening? I mean, I haven’t really thought about when I should start, just that I should.
DOCTOR: Generally, screening guidelines for men do not include breast cancer considerations. However, given your family history, we can… accommodate your anxieties. I’ll order a clinical breast exam. It won’t be comprehensive, naturally, but it’s a starting point. And please, try to be… rational about this. It's highly improbable. Let's proceed. Please undress from the waist up, and I will begin.
PATIENT: Undress? Really? I… I thought it would just be talking, maybe some questions about my health. Is that… standard procedure? It just feels a bit… excessive, considering.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, with all due respect, I am the physician here. A physical examination is essential for even a preliminary assessment. We need to feel for any abnormalities. It's a basic tenet of medicine. Unless you intend to self-diagnose, I suggest you cooperate. And frankly, your anxieties are delaying the process. Now, are you going to allow me to perform a necessary examination, or shall we simply waste further time?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not trying to be difficult. It’s just… I’ve never had a physical exam like that before. And it feels a bit… intrusive. Especially considering you said it was unlikely. Is there… anything else we can do first? Maybe some blood work? Or a scan? Something less… hands-on?
DOCTOR: Blood work and scans are not appropriate initial steps for a screening assessment, Mr. Theriot! They are costly, often yield false positives, and expose you to unnecessary radiation. We establish a baseline first. A clinical exam is non-invasive, relatively quick, and provides valuable information. Honestly, your hesitation is… frankly, perplexing. Are you questioning my medical judgment?
PATIENT: No, I'm not questioning your judgment. I just… I’m not comfortable. It feels like you’re dismissing my concerns. And you keep saying it’s unlikely, so what’s the point of a thorough exam? It feels like you’re just going through the motions to appease me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I have other patients waiting. It appears we are at an impasse. I am a physician, not a therapist. I can offer a clinical exam as a professional courtesy, given your family history. If you are unwilling to cooperate with a basic medical assessment, I suggest you seek a second opinion. Perhaps another physician will be more accommodating to your… anxieties. But frankly, I do not have time for this. Do you wish to proceed, or shall I document your refusal and terminate the consultation?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… please be quick. And explain what you’re doing as you go. I just… I want to understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. Undress to the waist, and lie down on your back. I will begin with palpation of the lymph nodes, then proceed to the breast tissue. I will explain each step as I go, though I expect you to refrain from unnecessary commentary. And please, try to relax. Tension will only make the examination more difficult. Let's begin.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: I am assessing for any signs of enlargement or tenderness. No abnormalities detected thus far. Again, no palpable masses or tenderness. I am feeling for any lumps, thickening, or changes in texture. Your breast tissue appears… unremarkable. However, it is somewhat difficult to assess accurately given your… limited muscle mass. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little. Not pain, exactly, just… pressure. It feels… sensitive. Especially on this side.
DOCTOR: Sensitive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not constant, just… when you press there. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt on its own, but it feels… different than the other side.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is a slight… firmness present. It’s small, approximately one centimeter in diameter. And it does seem to be somewhat deeper than the surrounding tissue. It could be a benign cyst, a localized area of glandular tissue, or… something else. I’m not prepared to offer a definitive diagnosis at this stage. We'll need further investigation.
PATIENT: Something else? What do you mean, something else? Is it… is it cancer? You said it could be a lot of things, but… you were already saying it was unlikely. Is this… is this changing things?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your anxiety, but you are jumping to conclusions. A single, small firmness does not automatically equate to cancer. It requires further evaluation. I will order a mammogram and an ultrasound to get a clearer picture of what we are dealing with. You are relatively young, so the imaging may be less sensitive, but it is a necessary step. I am also referring you to a radiologist specializing in breast imaging. They will be able to interpret the results and determine if a biopsy is required. Here is the referral. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A biopsy? You're actually saying… a biopsy? I thought you said it was unlikely. And… how long will it take to get the results? And what if… what if it is cancer? What do I do then? This is… this is too much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I have other patients waiting. The timeframe for receiving the results will depend on the radiologist's schedule and the complexity of the imaging. As for what you do if it is cancer… that is a question for an oncologist. I am a family medicine physician, not a specialist. My role is to identify potential concerns and refer you to the appropriate care team. I have provided you with the referral information. It is your responsibility to schedule the appointment and follow up with the specialist. Do you have any further questions for me, or shall I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No. I… I think I’m done. Just… thank you. I guess.
