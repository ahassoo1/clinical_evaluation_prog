DOCTOR: Hi Triana, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this…problem. It's been going on for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. I've tried…things. I really don't have time for this, you know? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – nobody wants to be spending time dealing with health issues when they have other things going on. “Things” is a bit vague, though – could you tell me a bit more about what you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. I took some of those over-the-counter things, the stuff for…stomach stuff. And then I went to that…walk-in clinic a couple of times. They gave me something, a pink liquid, but it didn’t do a thing. Honestly, they didn't seem to know what they were doing over there. It's just…diarrhea. Constant diarrhea. Is that really so hard to fix?
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant diarrhea for weeks, despite trying some over-the-counter remedies and a medication from the walk-in clinic that didn't help. And you felt like the walk-in clinic didn’t fully investigate things. That's good information. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: It started…let me think. It was right after my husband’s memorial. So, probably…end of June, maybe? Everything’s just been a blur, to be honest. It started a few days after, and it hasn't really let up since. It's just…inconvenient, is all. I have a business to run, you know. People expect things to be done.
DOCTOR: I am so sorry for your loss, Triana. Losing your husband must be incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable that things feel blurred right now. It sounds like this started shortly after a very stressful event, which is important to note. So, diarrhea beginning around the end of June, following your husband's memorial. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Look, I eat normal food. I don't go around eating…bad things. I guess…stress? It feels worse when I'm particularly busy, or when I'm thinking about…everything. But it's always there, really. It's just…more intense sometimes. I don't know. I'm not a doctor, I just know it's awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be somewhat linked to stress, and is generally constant, but flares up when you’re busier or thinking about things. That's helpful. Now, can you describe what the diarrhea is like?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? You need to know everything? It’s…watery. A lot of it. Several times a day, every day. No…it’s not bloody, if that's what you're asking. Just…a lot of liquid. And it's exhausting, frankly. I'm constantly running to the bathroom. It's humiliating, and it's taking a toll on me. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I apologize for asking such personal questions, but it is important information to help figure out what’s going on. No blood is good to know. Frequent, watery stools for weeks is definitely concerning, and it sounds incredibly disruptive to your life. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m tired, obviously. Constantly running to the bathroom will do that to you. And…I haven't been very hungry, I guess. I've lost a little weight, but I haven’t really been keeping track. I just haven't felt like eating. I'm a little…weak, maybe? I don’t know. Honestly, I just feel awful all the time. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, decreased appetite, some weight loss, and feeling generally weak alongside the diarrhea. That’s quite a bit. To get a complete picture, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions? Not really. I mean, I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. My husband...he had some things. But me? Nothing major. I've always been pretty healthy. I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. I just don’t like being poked and prodded. Is this going somewhere? Are you going to start poking and prodding me now?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I'll certainly respect your boundaries. I just need to rule out some possibilities. I am not trying to make you uncomfortable. Alright, so no major past medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. I’m perfectly fine in one piece, thank you very much. Look, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to keep asking me a million questions? I have clients waiting, you know. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the delay, and I appreciate your patience. I am getting a clearer picture, and I'll try to be more efficient. Family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. Honestly? It's a mess. My mother had…something with her stomach, I think. But she didn’t really talk about it. My father…he was a drinker. That's about all I know. It wasn't a particularly close family. I really don’t know much about their medical problems. Can we just skip this part? It's not helpful, I promise you.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can skip that part. And I apologize again for the long questions. Let's talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. Nothing regular. And I tried that pink liquid the walk-in clinic gave me, but it didn't do anything, remember? I really don’t take a lot of pills. I prefer to just…deal with things. Look, I'm starting to feel really impatient here. Are we almost done? I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional ibuprofen, and the pink liquid from the walk-in clinic that wasn't helpful. Alright. Last question for now: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. Never had one. I eat everything. I’m perfectly fine. Look, can we just be done? I’m really starting to regret coming here. I wasted a perfectly good afternoon. What are you going to do about this? Are you going to give me something that actually works?
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the delay. Alright, Triana. So, to summarize, you've been experiencing constant, watery diarrhea for several weeks, beginning after your husband’s memorial. It’s somewhat linked to stress, and it's impacting your energy levels and appetite. You've tried over-the-counter remedies and a medication from a walk-in clinic that didn't help. You have no significant medical history, no allergies, and are not currently taking any regular medications. Given the duration and severity of your symptoms, and the fact that it’s impacting your quality of life, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if you start poking and prodding too much, I'm leaving. I have a business to run, you know. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll just listen to your abdomen. It will only take a moment. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, but there's a little tenderness when I press here on your lower left side. Not alarming, but something we need to consider. I'm also going to check your vital signs - just your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. One moment. Okay, everything looks relatively normal there. Given the chronic nature of your diarrhea and the tenderness I’m feeling, I think we should do a stool sample test, just to rule out any infection. And I’d like to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – to check for any dehydration or inflammation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Really? Do I have to? It sounds…disgusting. And bloodwork? More poking and prodding? Look, I really don't have time for all of this. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't you just give me something to stop the diarrhea? Something strong? Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. But if it takes too long, I'm leaving. I have a schedule to keep. And I want results. Fast. I don't want to be sitting around waiting for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. It is unpleasant, and I wouldn't suggest it if it weren't important to rule out potential causes. The stool sample will help us check for any bacterial or parasitic infections, and the bloodwork will give us a better picture of your overall health and hydration levels. I'll have the nurse come in with the collection kit for the stool sample. As for the bloodwork, we can do that right here in the office. It won't take long. The results should be back within a few business days – I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I'm going to recommend a bland diet – things like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. And drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, or electrolyte solutions. I want to emphasize that, given the duration of your symptoms and the associated fatigue and weight loss, it's important to rule out anything serious. We need to be thorough, even if it's unpleasant. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Bananas, rice, applesauce... Honestly? It sounds awful. But fine. I'll try it. Just…get me the kit. And hurry up. I have a job to do, you know. And make sure that assistant calls me ASAP. I don't want to be sitting around wondering what's wrong with me for weeks. And please, don't give me any more lectures about how important it is to be thorough. I get it. Just fix me. That's all I want. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse bring in the stool sample kit right away. And I’ll make sure my assistant prioritizes getting you a call with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice any blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. It's always better to be safe. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
