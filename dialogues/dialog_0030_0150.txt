DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Yes, well. I’m here because I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens easily. I don’t have time for…complications. I'm 51, you know. Not getting any younger. Let’s just get right to what needs to be done, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s good you’re planning ahead, and we can absolutely discuss options to help make that happen. To give you the best advice, I’d like to gather some more information. First, have you been trying to conceive currently, and if so, for how long?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not actively trying. I’m here to prevent the need for “trying.” I want to know what tests I need, what vitamins I should be taking, and if there’s anything… structurally… I should be concerned about before I even bother. I’m a practical woman, Doctor. Wasting time is not an option.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to be proactive, Ms. Shteynberg. That's a very sensible approach. Given your age, a thorough evaluation is certainly a good idea. Let’s start with some background information, if you don't mind. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Of course I have! Twice. Both… difficult pregnancies, I assure you. That’s why I’m here now. Don’t need a repeat of that mess. One boy, one girl. Both grown and… frankly, quite a handful. Is this relevant? Are you going to ask me about the details of my children’s childhoods now? I have appointments, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Shteynberg. Knowing you’ve had previous pregnancies gives us a starting point. And no, I won't need details about your children's childhoods. Knowing the pregnancies were difficult is relevant, as it gives me information about potential risks or complications we should consider. To continue, do you recall any specific complications you experienced during either pregnancy?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? The first, pre-eclampsia. Nearly lost me. The second… gestational diabetes, and the baby was… large. Very large. Induced, of course. A terrible experience. Both times, I was… quite ill afterwards. Really, I don't have the energy to rehash all of it. Are you a specialist in high-risk pregnancies? Because if not, I’m not sure this is going to be productive.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Shteynberg. Pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, and a large baby with an induction – that does give us important details to consider. While I'm a board-certified Family Medicine physician with experience managing pregnancies, given your history, I think a consultation with a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist would be the most prudent course of action. They specialize in high-risk pregnancies and can provide the most comprehensive care. Before we proceed with a referral, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Fine. But keep it brief. I have a bicycle shop to run, you know. This isn’t my life’s work, Doctor. Just… get to the point. Ask away. But if it involves a lot of blood tests and waiting around, I’m walking out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I'll be as efficient as possible. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. Well… the gestational diabetes during that second pregnancy, but it went away after the birth. Otherwise, perfectly healthy. I exercise regularly, I eat a sensible diet… unlike some people I know. Really, I take very good care of myself. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Now, is there a test to check if my… everything is still in working order, so to speak? That’s what I want. Not a life story questionnaire.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Shteynberg. It's helpful to know you've been healthy overall. Yes, there are several tests we can do to assess your overall health and reproductive function. A basic blood panel, a pelvic exam, and potentially an ultrasound would be a good starting point. The ultrasound would allow us to assess the condition of your uterus and ovaries. Do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’m Hungarian, Doctor. We’re made of stronger stuff than allergies. No, nothing. And please, let’s skip the pelvic exam if possible. I really… dislike those. Are you absolutely certain a specialist is required for every step? I'm capable of understanding a simple blood test result.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort with the pelvic exam, Ms. Shteynberg. We can certainly discuss proceeding with just the blood tests initially. However, given your history of difficult pregnancies, a thorough assessment is important. The specialist can best determine which tests are necessary and interpret the results in the context of your individual situation. Before we schedule a referral, let's quickly review your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes, ibuprofen for my back. I lift heavy things at the shop, you know. Otherwise, no. Absolutely nothing else. Honestly, Doctor, are we done yet? This is taking far too long. I have customers waiting. Let's just get the referral, and I'll be on my way. The sooner I get this done, the better. And please, make sure it's a good specialist. I don't want to waste my time with someone inexperienced.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I completely understand. I'll go ahead and write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist in the city. She has excellent reviews and a lot of experience with high-risk pregnancies. I'll also have the receptionist schedule a basic blood panel for you today, as a starting point. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. Here's the referral information, and the lab order. Please call Dr. Vance’s office to schedule an appointment at your convenience. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I’ll call the specialist. And honestly, Doctor, I expect a quick and efficient experience. I don’t have time for endless waiting rooms and unnecessary procedures. Good day.
