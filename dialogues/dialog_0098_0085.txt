DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this patch of skin. On my arm, mostly. It's just… not right. I noticed it a few weeks back, and it hasn’t gotten better, let's just say that.
DOCTOR: Alright, a patch of skin on your arm that’s been bothering you for a few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… discolored. Not a nice color, certainly. A sort of… muddy brown, I suppose? And it’s a little rough to the touch. Not painful, thankfully, just… unsightly. I’ve always taken good care of my skin, you know. Very diligent with sunscreen. It’s just… concerning, given my family history. My grandmother, God rest her soul, had… issues. Things she wouldn’t discuss, really. But they involved the skin, that much I know.
DOCTOR: I understand. A change in skin appearance is definitely something to investigate, especially with a family history involved. You mentioned “issues” with your grandmother. Do you recall any specifics, even if it’s just a general idea of what she experienced?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. She was… a very private woman. Very old-fashioned. She’d just say things like "women's troubles" or “something you don’t want to know about.” It was infuriating as a child, and now… well, now I wish I’d pressed her. But it was definitely something visible, because my mother would always make sure her arms were covered when visiting. That’s really all I know. She didn’t want to talk about it, and my mother didn’t push. It’s just… it makes me nervous, naturally. I don't want whatever she had. It looked unpleasant, if I’m being honest. Very… blotchy. And she always wore long sleeves, even in summer.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a visible skin condition with a family history, and it's understandably causing you some concern. Let’s focus on what you’re experiencing now. You said it’s a muddy brown patch. Has it changed in size or shape at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It has gotten a bit bigger. Not dramatically, but… noticeable, if you look closely. I’d say maybe… an inch across now? It was more like half an inch when I first spotted it. And it’s… well, the edges are a bit… uneven? It’s not a perfect circle, if that makes sense. More like a… blob. A very unattractive blob, really. And I do try to keep an eye on these things, you know. It's not something one ignores. Honestly, I’m quite meticulous.
DOCTOR: Okay, growing in size, uneven edges… that’s helpful to know. And you mentioned you're meticulous about checking your skin, which is excellent. Has there been any itching, bleeding, or any other symptoms associated with the patch?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No itching, no bleeding, no pain. It’s just… there. A discolored blob. It doesn’t feel different, which is… confusing, frankly. One would expect something, wouldn’t one? It's not raised or anything. Just… a change in color and size. It's very… subtle, really. But I'm observant, so I noticed it right away. I do wish it would just go away on its own, but it clearly isn’t going to. It’s quite irritating, if I’m honest. I feel as though I'm constantly checking it. It’s distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a closer look at it. If you’d be so kind, could you please roll up your sleeve and have a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly. There. Do be gentle, please. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. Approximately one and a half inches in diameter, irregular borders, muddy brown discoloration. It’s flat, as you described, and doesn’t appear inflamed. The skin surrounding it is normal in appearance. No obvious signs of bleeding or ulceration. Hmm… it is subtle. I'm going to palpate it gently now. Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort at all. It feels… normal, really. Just… different colored. You don't seem terribly concerned, Doctor. Is that a good sign? I do appreciate a straightforward assessment. I dislike fuss and unnecessary worry.
DOCTOR: No, you're right to ask. It is subtle, and it doesn't present with many of the more concerning characteristics. However, given the family history and the change in size, it's prudent to investigate further. It could be a number of things – a benign mole, a pigmentary change, or something else entirely. I wouldn't want to dismiss it without being thorough. To be on the safe side, I’d like to perform a simple biopsy. It involves taking a small sample of the skin for examination under a microscope. It's a quick procedure, usually done in the office under local anesthesia. Do you have any concerns about that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… rather drastic, doesn't it? For a little discoloration? I'd hoped for a simpler explanation. Is it absolutely necessary? I'm not overly fond of needles, you see. And I do have a rather busy schedule. Is there nothing else we can try? Perhaps a cream, or a prolonged observation period? I’m just not keen on having bits of my skin removed unless it’s truly unavoidable. My grandmother… well, she had a lot of procedures. They weren't pleasant, from what I gathered.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Bartock. You’re right, it's not a decision to take lightly. And I apologize if I jumped to it too quickly. Given your concerns and your grandmother's experiences, let's discuss the options. A prolonged observation period is certainly possible. We could monitor the patch over a few months, taking photographs to document any changes in size, shape, or color. However, with the growth you've already noticed, it might delay a definitive diagnosis if it is something that requires treatment. There are creams that can address pigmentary changes, but they're unlikely to be effective if it’s a different type of skin condition. Ultimately, a biopsy provides the most accurate information. It’s a small procedure, and we can certainly minimize any discomfort. We numb the area completely. And, depending on the results, it could be a relief to know exactly what we’re dealing with, and to rule out anything serious. Would you like me to explain the biopsy procedure in more detail, and we can discuss the risks and benefits further?
PATIENT: Very well. Explain the procedure, then. But please be concise. I have a luncheon engagement later, and I do detest being kept waiting. And do emphasize the minimal discomfort aspect. I’m not fond of pain, you understand. Though, I suppose, if it’s truly unavoidable… But I expect a full explanation of the potential downsides, as well. My grandmother... she was always very distrustful of doctors. She felt they were too quick to cut and poke. I tend to agree with her, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The procedure itself is relatively straightforward. First, we’ll clean the area around the patch with an antiseptic solution. Then, I’ll inject a small amount of local anesthetic – a numbing medication – into the skin around the patch. This will take a few moments to take effect. You might feel a brief pinch during the injection, but the area should become completely numb. Once the area is numb, I’ll use a small instrument – it looks a bit like a tiny cookie cutter – to remove a small sample of the skin. The size of the sample depends on the appearance of the patch, but it’s usually only a few millimeters across. After removing the sample, we’ll apply a small bandage to the area to stop any bleeding. The whole procedure usually takes about 15-20 minutes. As for downsides, there's a small risk of infection, bleeding, or scarring. However, these are rare, and we take precautions to minimize those risks. You might experience some mild discomfort or tenderness after the procedure, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. The sample will then be sent to a lab for examination by a pathologist. The results usually take about a week to come back. Does that sound… less alarming?
PATIENT: A week? A whole week of worrying? Honestly, Doctor, that seems an unnecessarily long time. And "mild discomfort" is a rather vague term. I prefer specifics. Is there any possibility of a quicker turnaround time? I simply don't have a week to spare, pacing around wondering what horrors are lurking within that tiny piece of my skin. And what sort of "specifics" are we talking about regarding the discomfort? Is it throbbing? Stinging? Will it interfere with my social engagements? I have a charity gala next month, and I absolutely cannot have a bandage visible. It would be most unbecoming. Honestly, this is proving to be quite a lot of bother for a small discoloration. I'm beginning to think I should have simply ignored it.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Ms. Bartock, and I apologize for not being more thorough initially. Let me address your concerns. Regarding the turnaround time, I can certainly contact the lab and see if they can expedite the results. It’s not always possible, but I’ll do my best. I typically have a good rapport with their technicians. As for the discomfort, it's usually a mild soreness or tenderness, similar to a minor scrape. Some people experience a slight throbbing sensation for the first few hours, but it's generally well-controlled with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. The area will likely be covered with a small bandage, which we can carefully position to minimize visibility. Once the wound has healed sufficiently – usually within a week or two – there is typically no visible scarring. However, everyone heals differently, so I can't guarantee it. I understand your concern about the charity gala. If you're concerned about the bandage, we can schedule the biopsy well in advance of the event, allowing ample time for healing. Or, if you're still hesitant, we can reconsider the observation period. But I must reiterate that this will mean a longer wait for a definitive diagnosis. Would you like me to make a call to the lab and see about expediting the results?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Contact the lab. And make it clear that this is a matter of some urgency. Honestly, the thought of pacing around for a week, worrying about some unknown malady, is quite distressing. I rely on my appearance, you see. It’s… important. And, while you're at it, inquire about their success rate with minimizing scarring. I have… a rather sensitive complexion. Very well. Contact the lab, and then we can discuss the logistics of scheduling this… unfortunate procedure. But I must insist on a thorough explanation of the aftercare instructions. I don't want to be left to my own devices, guessing what to do. My grandmother always said doctors were too quick to dismiss patients after a procedure. I share her skepticism.
DOCTOR: “Good afternoon, this is Dr. Bombara’s office. I have a sample I’d like to send over for pathology, and I was hoping to inquire about a quicker turnaround time. The patient has a busy schedule and is understandably anxious to receive the results… Yes, Ms. Bartock. Okay, let me give you the information… Thank you. I appreciate that. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to expedite the process… Excellent. Thank you so much.” They’ve assured me they’ll do their best to expedite the results, and I should have an estimated turnaround time within the next hour. As for the aftercare instructions, they're quite simple. We’ll apply a small bandage to the area, which you should keep clean and dry for the first 24-48 hours. You can gently wash the area with mild soap and water after that. Avoid direct sun exposure and harsh chemicals. And, if you experience any signs of infection – such as redness, swelling, or pus – please contact me immediately. I’ll also provide you with a detailed written aftercare sheet before you leave. We can schedule the biopsy for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. It will take about 20-30 minutes, and we can ensure the bandage is positioned discreetly. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning is… acceptable. But only if it’s early. I have a hair appointment at eleven, and I simply cannot reschedule. And I insist on a detailed explanation of the potential complications. I don’t want any surprises. And, Doctor, please be gentle. I have a low pain tolerance, and I dislike needles immensely. It's quite… unnerving. Very well. Tomorrow morning it is. But you must promise me a thorough explanation of everything. I don't want to feel as though I’m being rushed or dismissed. My grandmother… well, she always said doctors were too quick to cut and poke without proper consideration. I share her sentiments. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Bartock. I promise to be as gentle and thorough as possible. We’ll take our time, and I’ll explain every step of the procedure before we begin. I will also be available to answer any questions you may have, both before and after the biopsy. We'll schedule you for 9:00 am tomorrow, allowing ample time for the procedure and to ensure you make your hair appointment at eleven. I will personally administer the local anesthetic and carefully position the bandage to minimize visibility. I will also provide you with detailed written aftercare instructions and my direct contact information should you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can address before we schedule the appointment and conclude the consultation for today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Though, do remind me again of the potential complications. It’s always best to be prepared. And ensure the bandage is a discreet color. I wouldn’t want it to clash with my outfit. Honestly, this is proving to be quite a bother, but I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Very well. Schedule the appointment for 9:00 am tomorrow, and do be gentle. And discreet. And remember the bandage. I’m relying on your professionalism, Doctor. Don’t disappoint me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. Just to reiterate, the potential complications are minimal – a small risk of infection, bleeding, or scarring. We take precautions to minimize those risks, and I will be monitoring the area closely after the procedure. We’ll use a skin-toned bandage to ensure it’s discreet, and I assure you I will do my best to make the experience as comfortable as possible. Your appointment is scheduled for 9:00 am tomorrow. I look forward to seeing you then. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment.
