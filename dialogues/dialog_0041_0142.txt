DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Right, well, it's... headaches, mostly. Bad ones. They come on quick, and I get really sweaty when they do, and my heart feels like it’s thumpin’ a lot. It’s been happenin’ on and off for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, I can’t put a good timeline on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches… coming on quickly with sweating and a fast heartbeat. It’s good you’re getting this checked out. When you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… …Months, I reckon? Maybe six? It’s hard to say for sure. Things kinda blur together, you know? I don't really remember when the first one hit, just that they started happenin’. It’s not constant, thankfully. More like… episodes. Bad episodes.
DOCTOR: Right, episodes… that’s helpful. And these episodes… can you describe what the headache feels like?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… it’s not like a normal headache. It’s not just a dull ache, it's… like a really tight band squeezin’ my head. And it feels… deep, if that makes sense? Not just on the surface. It kinda throbs, too, but mostly it’s just… pressure. A lot of pressure. It makes it hard to think, and everything gets kinda blurry. Sorry, it’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. You’re describing it just fine. A tight, deep pressure with throbbing, and some blurry vision… Okay. And where exactly do you feel the pressure?
PATIENT: Mostly… all over, I think? But it seems to be worst right around my temples, and kinda at the back of my head. Sometimes it feels like it’s in my eyes, too. It’s not always in the same spot, though. That’s another thing that makes it hard to keep track of. It kinda moves around, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that makes sense. It sounds like it's quite all-encompassing. And how long do these episodes typically last?
PATIENT: Ugh, that varies too. Sometimes it’s just a few hours, maybe an hour or two. But… there was one last month, I think, that lasted almost a whole day. That was… rough. I just had to lie in a dark room. Everything spins a bit when I stand up during them. It’s… not fun. I try to just ride it out, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, lasting anywhere from an hour to a whole day, and some dizziness when you stand up. And you mentioned lying in a dark room helps. Do you notice anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… …Not really. That's the frustrating part. I haven't been able to find any pattern to it. I mean, I’ve tried to think… sometimes it happens when I’m stressed, maybe? But other times I’m just… relaxin’ and it’ll hit me outta nowhere. I haven't changed my diet or anything recently. Nothing I can point to, honestly. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, no clear triggers, even with stress. That makes things tougher to figure out. Let’s talk a bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… sometimes. Not always, but yeah, I’ve felt a bit sick to my stomach during some of ‘em. Haven’t actually thrown up, thankfully. But definitely queasy. And… sometimes I get a bit sensitive to light during them, too. That’s why I like the dark room. Bright lights just make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea and light sensitivity. Have you noticed any changes in your vision outside of the blurry vision during these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… …Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything seems normal when I’m not havin’ one. No floaters or anything like that. Just the blurriness during the episode. I haven’t been to the optician in… ages, to be honest. Probably should get that checked out, but… never get around to it.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s move on to other things, then. Any fever, neck stiffness, or any weakness or numbness anywhere?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And my neck feels fine, not stiff or anything. No weakness or numbness either. Just… the headache and the other stuff we talked about. I feel… normal between episodes, mostly. Just a bit tired, maybe. I don't know. It's hard to explain. Like a normal person, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, neck stiffness, weakness, or numbness. Now, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s the thing. I think so. Vaguely. I had some when I was younger, but… it was a long time ago. And I don't really remember what they were like. They weren’t this bad, I don’t think. But honestly, my memory’s… not the greatest. It's all a bit of a blur. It's like I’m tryin’ to piece things together, but the pieces don’t really fit.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s talk about your past medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Umm… …Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s about it. No serious illnesses or anything. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. Just the usual colds and flus, you know? Nothing that required a doctor's visit, not for a long time. And I'm divorced, if that matters. I mean, it wasn't a health thing, but...
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history. And just for my records, have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Just the broken arm, and that didn’t need surgery. They just put it in a cast. I was a right mess as a kid, always climbin’ trees and fallin’ outta ‘em. But never needed an operation, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Umm… …My mom, she gets migraines sometimes. Really bad ones. Has done for years. And my granddad, he used to get really bad headaches too, but I don’t know much about ‘em. Never really talked about it. Other than that… I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. Didn’t really keep track of it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I don't really like takin' pills, if I can avoid it. I try to just… tough it out, usually. Paracetamol now and then for a cold, but that's about it. I don't take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I think I'd know if I was allergic to somethin', wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Right, you would. Okay. Now, I’m just going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a quick neurological exam. Just to get a better picture of things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don't mind. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Hopefully you can figure out what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little high. Nothing to worry about immediately, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes, coordination, and a few other things. Follow my finger with your eyes, please. Good. Now, squeeze my hands… Both are equal. And finally, can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can do that. No problem at all. Feels… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything seems neurologically intact. Reflexes are normal, coordination is good. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing tension headaches, possibly with some migraine features. The episodic nature, the pressure-like pain, nausea, and light sensitivity all fit that picture. However, the elevated blood pressure is a concern, and we need to investigate that further. It's also good to rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Umm… …Tension headaches? I thought I said the pain was all over? And what about the palpitations? Does that fit with just… tension? And the blood pressure… is that bad? Should I be worried? It's just… it all feels a bit… vague, you know? Like there’s somethin’ else goin’ on.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions. It is good to clarify. Tension headaches often present with a tight, band-like pressure, and can be all over the head. However, the palpitations – that feeling of your heart racing – and the nausea and light sensitivity do lean more towards migraine. It's possible to have both, or even have something else underlying. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to look into. One reading isn’t definitive, but it warrants further investigation. It could be stress-related, but we need to rule out other causes. To be thorough, I’d like to order some blood work to check your general health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'd also recommend a 24-hour blood pressure monitor to get a better picture of your blood pressure throughout the day. And, given your history of headaches, I think it’s prudent to get an MRI of your brain, just to rule out anything structural. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. And blood work and a monitor… it's a lot. Is it somethin' really bad, Doc? I mean, I just thought it was bad headaches. I don't like hospitals, and that sounds like a lot of… stuff. I just want to feel normal again, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jaxston, and it does sound like a lot. But it’s important to remember that we’re doing this to be thorough and rule things out. An MRI is a very safe and effective way to get a detailed picture of your brain, and it doesn’t involve any radiation. It’s often used as a precautionary measure, especially when someone is experiencing persistent headaches. The blood work is just a routine check to see if there are any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. And the blood pressure monitor is a simple device you wear for 24 hours – it doesn’t require a hospital visit. It’s unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong, but we need to have all the information before we can make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan. I want to find out what’s causing your headaches and get you feeling better as soon as possible. We’ll take it one step at a time. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds… better. Explain the MRI again, please. What exactly does it show? And… will it make me feel sick or anything? I hate being in small spaces, if that makes a difference. I just… I don’t want to panic.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns about the MRI, especially if you have claustrophobia. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues in your body. It's excellent at showing the brain, allowing us to look for any structural abnormalities, such as tumors, aneurysms, or any signs of inflammation. The machine itself is a long, narrow tube. You'll lie on a table that slides into the tube. It can be noisy – it sounds like a loud banging or humming – so we'll give you earplugs or headphones to help with that. As for feeling sick, it's rare, but some people experience a bit of nausea or anxiety during the scan. We can give you a mild sedative to help you relax if you're concerned about that. The scan usually takes about 30-60 minutes. We'll make sure you're comfortable and that we’re taking all the necessary precautions. If you're feeling claustrophobic at any point during the scan, you can press a button to stop the machine immediately. Would you like me to provide you with a handout about the MRI, with more detailed information?
PATIENT: A handout would be great, yeah. And… the button to stop it… that’s good to know. So, if I start panicking, I can just press it? That makes me feel a bit better. And what about the blood work? What are you lookin’ for exactly? Just… general health stuff?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You can press the button at any time if you feel uncomfortable. The technicians are monitoring you throughout the scan, so they’ll be able to assist you immediately. As for the blood work, we’ll be checking a range of things. A complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. We’ll also check your electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels. We'll also check your blood sugar levels. Basically, we’re looking for any abnormalities that could be contributing to your headaches or palpitations. It’s a routine test, but it gives us a lot of valuable information. I’ll write you a requisition form for the blood work and MRI. You can schedule the MRI appointment at your convenience. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Follow-up appointment… I guess I don’t have much choice, do I? Just… try not to scare me too much with the results, Doc. I’m already stressed enough. When should I expect a call to schedule the MRI?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I promise I’ll explain everything clearly and honestly, without scaring you unnecessarily. We’ll take it one step at a time, and we’ll work together to find out what’s causing your headaches. The MRI scheduling department should call you within the next 24-48 hours to arrange an appointment. They'll explain the process and answer any questions you have. In the meantime, if your headaches worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you explainin’ everything. Hopefully, it’s just somethin’ simple. I’ll wait for the call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. Remember, we're here to help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And I hope it is something simple too. Take care, and I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment.
