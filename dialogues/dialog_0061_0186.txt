DOCTOR: Talofa, Mr. Kingan. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Just… a physical. For a team tryout. I gotta get cleared, you know? Football. Old man’s football, but still. Gotta make sure I don’t… break anything during the tryout, not before. So yeah, that’s it. Let's get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sports physical for football. That’s great! It's good you're thinking ahead about getting cleared. Just so I have a complete picture, have you had a physical recently – within the last year, maybe?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Not a full one. I think I had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy a few months back, but that’s about it. Years ago, when I was… younger, I had them regularly. But not lately. Why do you ask? Is it bad I haven’t? I feel alright, mostly. A few aches, but what old man doesn't?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all that you haven’t had one recently. It just helps me to have a baseline, you know?
PATIENT: Right, baseline. Okay. Makes sense. So, what do we do? You poke and prod? Ask a bunch of questions? I’m good either way, honestly. Just… efficient is good. I got things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: A little bit of both, actually. I’ll ask you some questions about your health history, then do a physical exam. It shouldn't take too long. We'll start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions—like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe? Like I said, the pharmacy checked it once. Nothing the doctor ever told me. Diabetes, no. Heart problems… my dad had something, I think, when he was really old, but I don’t know what. I’ve broken a few bones over the years playing sports, but nothing serious. Mostly sprains and bruises. Is that what you need to know? I'm not very good with remembering all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It's alright if you don't remember everything perfectly. We can work through it. So, no diagnosed high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems that you are aware of. And your dad had some kind of heart issue when he was older. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… my mom, she had… something with her chest. I don't remember exactly what. She passed away a long time ago. And my brother, he's pretty healthy, I think. He runs a lot. No heart problems that I know of, anyway. We weren't very close. Look, is this stuff really important? I mean, I feel fine. I just need a doctor to sign a paper so I can play football.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Kingan, but I understand your concern. It helps me to get a full picture of your health and make sure you’re safe to participate. It’s about more than just signing a paper. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. When I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. That’s about it. And… I broke my arm once, pretty badly, and had to stay in the hospital for a few days to get it set. That was… a long time ago. High school, maybe. Other than that, no. Mostly just bumps and bruises, like I said. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Tonsils out as a kid and a broken arm that required a hospital stay. And no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. A little ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, but that’s it. I drink a lot of water, eat… okay. Mostly okay. Not a health nut, but I try. I don’t need anything fancy. Look, are we almost done? I really gotta get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. That’s good. Last few questions, I promise. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I eat everything. My mom used to force me to try all sorts of weird stuff when I was a kid. Never had a reaction. Dust, maybe? Like everyone else. But not an allergy allergy. Just a little sneezing. So… no. Nothing to worry about. Can we just… get to the poking and prodding part now? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, that covers most of the important history questions. Now we can move on to the physical exam. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that’s fine. Just… quick, if you could. I got a practice later. Heart and lungs, okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… good. Sounds a little… wheezy, actually. Not terrible, but a bit diminished on the lower lobes. Okay. Now I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Wheezy? What’s that mean? Is that bad? Look, I used to smoke, a long time ago. Quit years ago, but maybe that’s it? I dunno. Just tell me if I'm gonna be okay to play football. That's all I care about. I'm gettin' a little nervous now.
DOCTOR: Okay, it could be related to previous smoking, yes. We’ll need to investigate that further if it doesn’t improve. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 142/88 – and your pulse is 80. That’s not dangerously high, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. Now, I’m just going to quickly look in your ears, nose, and throat. Open your mouth and say “Ah.”
PATIENT: Ah… Look, I got a tickle in my throat. Probably just allergies. Everything feels… tight, actually. Like there's something stuck. Can we just skip the throat part? This is makin' me anxious. I’m a big guy, but I don’t do well with doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can skip the detailed throat exam for now. I understand you're feeling anxious, Mr. Kingan. That's alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Legs relaxed. Did I do okay? Is everything alright? I always thought my reflexes were pretty good. Used to be a pretty fast runner, you know. What do you think? Can I play football? That's all I need to know. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are… a little diminished, actually. Not severely, but not as strong as they should be. And you mentioned some tightness in your throat. Given your elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, and the wheezing in your lungs… I’m a little concerned about your overall condition. I can’t clear you for football right now, Mr. Kingan. It would be irresponsible of me to do so without further investigation. I want to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to check your heart function. We also need to run some blood work to rule out any underlying issues.
PATIENT: No… No, no, no. Are you serious? All that… for nothing? Chest X-ray, EKG, blood work… that’ll take forever! I need to know now. The tryouts are next week. Look, can’t you just… sign the paper? I feel fine! I just need to get cleared. It's football, not… brain surgery! I've been playin' this sport my whole life. Please. Just sign the paper. I’ll take responsibility.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your frustration, and I truly do. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear. But my responsibility as your doctor is to ensure your safety and well-being. Clearing you without proper evaluation would be a disservice to you, and potentially dangerous. Playing football with an underlying health condition could have serious consequences. The chest X-ray and EKG will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs and heart. The blood work will help us rule out any other potential issues. I’m going to write you a referral to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist. I strongly recommend you schedule appointments with both specialists as soon as possible. I’m happy to discuss the results with you once you have them. Until we have those results, I can’t, in good conscience, clear you to play. I understand this is disappointing, but your health is the most important thing.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. You're the doctor. I guess I’m too old for this anyway. Thanks for nothing. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your disappointment, Mr. Kingan. I truly do. Please, take care of yourself. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
