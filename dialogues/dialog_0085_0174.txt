DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s nice to meet you too. I suppose I’m here because I haven’t been feeling myself lately. It’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I just feel… down. And tired. Very tired. I’d like to get this sorted out if possible, I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if it's difficult to explain. "Not feeling yourself" and feeling down and tired are good starting points. We'll try to figure things out together. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… It’s been… oh, goodness. Probably a good few months now. Maybe four or five? It came on gradually, I don’t think there was one specific thing that caused it. Just… a slow slide, really. I just haven’t had the energy to do much about it until now. Things have been… piling up, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, four or five months of a gradual decline in energy and feeling down. That’s helpful to know. And it sounds like things have been a bit overwhelming recently. When you say “not feeling yourself,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It's hard to put into words. I used to be… much more active. I was a lifeguard, you see, and did ski patrol. Still do, occasionally, but… less and less. I used to enjoy being with people, going out. Now… I find myself wanting to be alone. Everything feels like a chore. Even things I used to like. It’s like… a grey cloud has settled over everything. I’m not sad, exactly… just… empty. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Nani. It sounds like you’re experiencing a loss of interest and pleasure in things you used to enjoy, alongside the fatigue and withdrawal from social activities. That's very important information. Now, thinking back over those past four or five months, have you noticed anything that seems to make these feelings worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Worse… well, the weather, certainly. This dampness… it gets into your bones, you know? But… truthfully, I think when I’m alone for too long, it gets worse. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, I suppose. I want to be alone, but then being alone makes me feel… even more empty. And thinking about the future… that doesn’t help either. It just feels… bleak. I don't know if that answers your question, Doctor. I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Nani. It’s very common to have trouble putting feelings into words. So, damp weather and prolonged periods of solitude seem to exacerbate things, and thinking about the future isn’t helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your physical health. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it’s not what it used to be. I don’t really feel hungry, you see. I force myself to eat, just enough to keep going, but I don’t enjoy it. As for sleep… that’s a bit of a mess, too. I fall asleep alright, but I wake up several times during the night. And then I can’t get back to sleep. I just lie there… staring at the ceiling. It’s very frustrating. I’m always tired, but I can’t get a proper night’s rest. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Nani. Changes in appetite and disrupted sleep are both common with what you’re describing. Now, have you been experiencing any other physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My joints ache a bit, more than usual. I put that down to the dampness, mostly. And… I suppose I’ve been a little more forgetful than I used to be. Nothing major, just… misplacing things, forgetting appointments. Small things. Nothing to write home about, really. I’m an old woman, Doctor, these things happen. I don’t want to waste your time with trivialities. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of time at all, Nani. All of this information is important. Joint aches and increased forgetfulness are good to note. Before we move on to your medical history, I’d like to ask a few questions about your mood. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself, or have you felt like life isn’t worth living?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, no, nothing like that at all. Absolutely not. I’ve never even considered such a thing. I'm a strong woman, I've always been a strong woman. I just… feel a bit lost, you see? And tired. Very tired. It's not that I don't want to live, I just… don't feel much joy in it at the moment. I hope that answers your question, Doctor. It’s a bit of a… sensitive topic, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is a sensitive topic, and I appreciate you answering honestly, Nani. It’s good to hear you haven’t had thoughts of harming yourself. Alright, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. I have a bit of arthritis, mostly in my knees and hips. That’s why I don’t ski as much as I used to. And… I had my gallbladder removed years ago. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I used to be very active, you see. Kept me going. Do you need to know about medications? I take something for the arthritis, but that’s about it. It’s just a standard pain reliever, nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees and hips, and a past gallbladder removal. And you take a standard pain reliever for the arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, which is a blessing. I like my food, you see. It's one of the few things that still gives me pleasure. Although, as I said, my appetite hasn't been great lately. But that's just the tiredness, I think. Is there anything else you need to know about my medical history, Doctor? I'm trying to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Nani. No known allergies is good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult one. My mother had… well, she had a bit of a nervous disposition, I suppose. She worried a lot. And she did spend some time in hospital with… what was it? Depression, I think. Years ago, of course. My father was quite strong and healthy, lived to a good age. Other than that… not much that I can think of. My siblings are all reasonably healthy too, as far as I know. It’s not a family known for its ailments, thankfully. Is that what you were looking for, Doctor? It’s hard to recall everything, you see. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nani. A history of nervousness and possible depression in your mother is helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Social history… Well, I was married for many years, but we divorced some time ago. No children, unfortunately. I have a few friends, mostly from the lifeguard days. We used to meet regularly, but… I haven't been very sociable lately, as I said. I mostly keep to myself these days. I used to enjoy travelling, but I haven't been anywhere in years. It’s just… easier to stay home, you see. Less effort. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor? It’s not a very exciting story, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: It’s not about having an exciting story, Nani. It’s about understanding your life and what might be contributing to how you’re feeling. So, that's helpful to know. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a small glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Just a small one. And… certainly nothing else. I’m a sensible woman, Doctor. Always have been. I don't believe in those things. They only cause trouble. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I’m not boring you with all this. I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: You are not boring me at all, Nani. And thank you for being so open. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs is good to know. Okay, last few quick questions before we move on to a physical exam. Are you currently taking any vitamins or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take a multivitamin, just to keep my strength up. And sometimes, when my arthritis is particularly bad, I take ibuprofen, over-the-counter, you see. But not very often. Just when I really need it. Is that all, Doctor? I’m happy to answer any other questions you might have. I’m ready for the physical exam whenever you are. I just hope it doesn’t take too long, I have things to do, you know. Though, I don't remember what they are. It's the tiredness. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Thank you, Nani. That completes my initial questioning. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. It shouldn’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I do have things to… well, I don’t know what I have to do, but things nonetheless. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try to be still. Though I do fidget sometimes. It's the restlessness, you see. And the tiredness. Honestly. It affects everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nani. Just relax as much as possible. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little bit on the higher side. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, your knees and hips are a bit tender to the touch, and you have some discomfort with movement. Range of motion is slightly limited. I'm also going to check your reflexes quickly. Reflexes are normal. Okay, that completes the brief physical exam. Everything appears generally within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and tenderness in your joints. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work is fine. Anything that might help. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. It’s exhausting being so tired all the time. And… forgetful. Though, I suppose I shouldn't complain. I'm an old woman, things are bound to… slip. But it's still unsettling. So yes, blood work is good. When will I get the results, Doctor? I hope it’s not too long. I have things to… do. Though, I still can't remember what they are. Honestly. It’s the tiredness. It's truly debilitating.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. It’s not about being an “old woman,” it’s about figuring out what’s causing these symptoms so we can get you feeling better. The blood work should be back in about 3-5 business days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a Vitamin D supplement, as low Vitamin D can contribute to fatigue and muscle aches. I’ll write you a prescription for that now. While we wait for the blood work, I would also like to recommend gentle exercise, if you are able. Something low-impact, like walking or swimming. And, are you currently under any significant stress?
PATIENT: Stress? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. My life is… quiet, you see. Perhaps too quiet. I used to be very busy, always doing things. Now… well, now I mostly just sit. Though I did have a disagreement with a neighbour last week about the hedges… a minor thing, really. But it did upset me a bit. Perhaps that’s it? It’s just… irritating being bothered with such trivialities when I have things to… do. Honestly, I just can't seem to remember what those things are. Is it normal to be so forgetful, Doctor? It's quite unsettling. And exhausting. Everything is exhausting. I just want my energy back. Vitamin D… alright. That sounds sensible. Will that really help?
DOCTOR: It's completely normal to feel stressed even from seemingly minor things, Nani. And yes, it's quite possible the disagreement with your neighbor contributed to your feelings. It’s the build-up of these small things that can sometimes be the most draining. Vitamin D deficiency is quite common, and it can absolutely contribute to fatigue, muscle aches, and even mood changes. So, it’s worth addressing. We'll see what the blood work shows, but it’s a good place to start. While we are waiting for the results, I also want to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. I’m going to recommend a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test as part of the blood work, as an underactive thyroid can also cause similar symptoms. Is that alright?
PATIENT: TSH test… alright. If it might help, yes. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. It's exhausting being constantly tired and… empty. It's difficult to explain. Everything feels like such an effort. My neighbour did mention something about my memory… said I'd forgotten to close the gate again. It's irritating, you see. Such trivialities. And exhausting. Honestly, I just can't seem to remember anything properly anymore. Will the blood work show if my… my brain is alright, Doctor? That's what I'm most worried about, I suppose. More than the tiredness, more than the aches… it's the forgetfulness. Will the blood work show if I’m… alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nani. It’s completely valid to be worried about your memory. The TSH test will help rule out thyroid issues, which can affect cognitive function. And the blood work can give us some clues about potential underlying issues that might be contributing to your forgetfulness. However, it won't give us a definitive answer about your cognitive health. If the blood work comes back normal, or if we identify any other issues that are being addressed, and you continue to experience significant memory problems, I will recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. They can perform specific tests to assess your memory and thinking skills and determine if further investigation is needed. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A neurologist… alright. If it might help. I just want to know what's happening to me, you see. It’s unsettling feeling so… foggy. And exhausting. Honestly, everything is exhausting. If the blood work doesn’t show anything, then I’ll see a neurologist. That sounds… alright. So… blood work, Vitamin D, possibly a neurologist… Is there anything else I need to do, Doctor? Anything else I should be worrying about? Honestly, I just want to feel like myself again. I have things to… do. Though, I still can’t remember what those things are. It’s quite frustrating. And exhausting. Really exhausting.
DOCTOR: No, Nani, that’s everything for now. Let's focus on getting these blood tests done and seeing what they reveal. Try not to worry too much, and remember that we’re here to support you every step of the way. Here's the blood work order and your prescription. You can get these filled at your local pharmacy. In the meantime, try to get some gentle exercise if you're able, and focus on getting some rest. And if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week after the blood work results are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A week. Alright. I’ll try to get some rest. Though it’s difficult, you see. So many thoughts swirling around. And the forgetfulness… it’s quite unsettling. Blood work… Vitamin D… neurologist… Alright. I’ll try to remember everything. Though, honestly, I make no promises. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very… helpful. I appreciate it. I suppose that’s all. I should be going now. I have things to… do. Though I still can’t remember what they are. It's truly exhausting.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. Remember, we're here to help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and try to get some rest. We’ll see you in about a week.
