DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’ve gained quite a bit of weight recently, and I simply cannot seem to explain it. It’s… unsettling, really. I haven't changed my diet or exercise routine, and yet… here we are.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, you say. And how long has this weight gain been occurring, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began, I believe, around late February, perhaps early March. It was gradual at first, easily dismissed, but over the last few months it’s become quite noticeable. I can recall the exact weight on the scale in February – 168 pounds – and now… well, it's significantly more. It’s a precise recollection, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Precise, you say. Very well. And has anything else changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me consider… No, not really. My husband, Kazimieras, and I are quite settled in our routine. He’s retired, I continue my work at the hospital, and we see our grandchildren whenever we can. No new stressors, no major life events… I truly cannot pinpoint anything that would account for this. I've been sleeping normally, eating the same meals... it's perplexing.
DOCTOR: And you say your diet hasn't altered?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Kazimieras and I have always been… sensible eaters, if you will. Lots of potatoes, cabbage, some meat when we can afford it, and I always ensure we have a good portion of vegetables. Nothing processed, no sugary drinks… I prepare all our meals myself, so I know what we're consuming. Honestly, if anything, I'd expect to be losing weight with the amount of walking I do at work.
DOCTOR: Walking at work… what is your role at the hospital, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: I am an orderly, Doctor. I assist the nurses with patient care – making beds, transporting patients, delivering meals, that sort of thing. It's a physically demanding job, certainly. I’m on my feet for the entirety of my shift, and I am constantly moving about the hospital. It's not a desk job, that much is certain. It’s been my occupation for… well, nearly fifteen years now.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years… And you’ve maintained this level of activity throughout?
PATIENT: Yes, consistently. There have been minor fluctuations in the workload, of course, but nothing significant enough to impact my physical activity. I’ve always been quite diligent about staying active, even outside of work. We enjoy tending to our garden in the warmer months, and I make a point of walking to the market whenever possible. I find it… unsettling, Doctor, that this weight gain is occurring despite my consistent activity level. It simply doesn’t make sense.
DOCTOR: Right. And let’s move on to other things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, now that you mention it… they have been… a little irregular, perhaps? Not drastically so, but I have needed to use the restroom more frequently. It’s not painful, and there hasn’t been any blood, thankfully. It just… isn’t the same as it used to be. I hadn’t thought it particularly noteworthy, honestly, but now that you ask… yes, there’s been a change. A slight one, but noticeable to me. It began around the same time as the weight gain, I believe.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any fatigue, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. It’s not constant, but I find myself… more tired than usual, especially in the afternoons. I always attributed it to the physical demands of my work, but it’s persisted even on my days off. It’s a sort of… heavy fatigue, if that makes sense. Not a lack of energy, but a sense of being weighed down. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I’ve always been a very active person, and this sudden lack of stamina is concerning. It's difficult to describe, but it’s definitely a change. I recall being able to garden for hours without feeling exhausted; now, I need to rest frequently.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any changes in your skin, or hair?
PATIENT: Let me consider… Now that you mention it, yes. My hair has been… thinner, I suppose. Not dramatically so, but I've noticed more strands falling out when I brush it. And my skin... it feels drier, even with moisturizer. It's a subtle change, but noticeable. I recall having quite thick hair, and my skin always had a healthy glow, but that's diminished somewhat in recent months. It's another small detail, but I suppose it contributes to the overall picture. It all seems to coincide with this inexplicable weight gain.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to conduct a physical examination, Ms. Selbitschka. Please step onto the scale for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I do hope it’s accurate. My husband always says the scale is biased. But, there you are. Whatever the number is, it is what it is.
DOCTOR: 205 pounds. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76. Temperature is normal. Auscultation of the lungs is clear. Heart sounds are regular. Abdomen is soft, with no tenderness. No masses palpated. Thyroid is normal size and consistency. I also note some mild pitting edema in your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Edema, you say? Oh dear. I hadn’t noticed that… Well, I suppose I’ve been rather preoccupied with the weight gain itself. Is that… serious, Doctor? It’s just… everything seems to be changing, and it’s quite unsettling. I recall my legs being quite slender; I haven’t paid much attention lately, to be honest. What does this all mean?
DOCTOR: It’s concerning, Ms. Selbitschka. Given your weight gain, fatigue, bowel changes, hair loss, edema, and family history… I’m concerned about the possibility of hypothyroidism, or potentially Cushing’s syndrome. However, these are preliminary observations and require further investigation. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a TSH test, and a cortisol level. We’ll need to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: TSH test and cortisol level… Those sound… complicated. Is that going to involve a great deal of blood work, Doctor? I must admit, I’m not particularly fond of needles. But, if it’s necessary to determine the cause of all this… then, of course. I simply recall a simpler time, when my health didn’t require such… extensive investigation. What is the next step, practically speaking? And how long will it take to get the results? I’d like to have some idea of the timeframe.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will require a blood draw. Approximately five vials, I estimate. The lab is quite efficient; results typically take 7-10 business days. In the meantime, I want you to keep a detailed food diary, noting everything you consume, including portion sizes. I also want you to monitor your bowel movements – frequency, consistency, and any associated symptoms. Based on these initial results, we may need to consider a referral to an endocrinologist. However, let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We’ll review the blood work first and determine the appropriate course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Five vials… That is rather a lot. But, if it’s necessary… very well. I can certainly keep a food diary and monitor my bowel movements. It feels… overwhelming, to be honest, but I understand it’s important. An endocrinologist… that sounds serious. Doctor, based on your experience, what is the most likely cause of all this? I understand you haven’t seen the results yet, but… if you had to speculate, what would you suspect? I recall being perfectly healthy just months ago, and this sudden change is… alarming.
DOCTOR: Speculation is rarely helpful, Ms. Selbitschka. However, given your symptoms and the rate of weight gain, hypothyroidism is a strong possibility. It can cause fatigue, constipation, hair loss, and edema. Cushing’s syndrome is less common, but we must rule it out. It’s important to remember that these are just possibilities, and we need the blood work to confirm or deny these suspicions. We will proceed systematically and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. I will provide you with a lab requisition form and detailed instructions. Please schedule the blood draw as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Hypothyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome… I’ll try to remember those names. A systematic approach… that sounds reassuring. I suppose waiting for the results is the most difficult part. I recall a time when a simple check-up was sufficient. Very well. I will schedule the blood draw as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if it involves a great deal of blood work. I do hope we can determine the cause of all this soon. Is there anything else you require from me at this time?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Selbitschka. That will be all for today. Please call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. And do your best to remain calm. We will get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
