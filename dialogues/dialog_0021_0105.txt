DOCTOR: Alright, Bradlee Kochubey, 38 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Well, it's about… the surgery. The weight loss surgery. I think I’m here for, like, a check-up before that happens? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. My wife mostly handled setting everything up.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-operative check-up. Honestly, patients letting their spouses do all the arrangements… it rarely goes well. Details are important, you know?
PATIENT: Yeah, tell me about it. She's… very organized. I just… go along. I know it’s important, the surgery is, I just don’t always remember why or what I need to do. Is this going to be a long thing? I don’t have a terrible memory, just… things slip.
DOCTOR: Well, it shouldn’t be, if we can get a clear history. We need to review your past medical problems, any medications you're on, allergies... the usual. It’s standard procedure before any major operation. And frankly, it's a little frustrating when patients can't recall basic information. Do you have any idea when this surgery is scheduled?
PATIENT: Hmm… scheduled… I think… sometime in September? My wife said something about the 15th? But honestly, I could be wrong. I haven’t really been keeping track. I don’t take any regular medicine, not really. Just… ibuprofen sometimes, for my back. And I don’t think I have any allergies… but again, ask my wife, she’d know for sure. Sorry, I'm not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: “Not much help” is putting it mildly. Alright, let’s try this. Have you had any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… let me think. I had… chickenpox when I was a kid, of course. And I broke my arm once, playing football. Does that count? Nothing… serious, I don’t think. My wife keeps saying I should have gone to the doctor more, but I usually just tough things out. Is chickenpox important? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Chickenpox isn’t exactly relevant now, no. “Toughing things out” is… not a medical strategy. Do you have any ongoing pain, besides your back?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back aches sometimes, especially if I’ve been lifting things. But that’s just… part of getting older, I guess. I work in a store, so I’m on my feet all day. Sometimes it gets pretty sore, but I just take some ibuprofen and try to ignore it. No other pain, no. Nothing… constant. Does that make sense? I sometimes forget if something is constant or just happens now and then.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate. And ibuprofen, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, just ibuprofen. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing prescribed. Usually just a couple of pills if my back is really bothering me. Sometimes I’ll take it for a headache, too. Not every day, just… when I need it. I think that’s all the medicine I take. My wife might have some vitamins or something, but I don’t pay much attention to that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your family history. Any significant illnesses run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My dad had… high blood pressure, I think. And my mom… she had diabetes, later in life. That’s what I remember, anyway. My wife says my grandfather on my mother's side had something with his heart, but I don’t know what. Everyone on my mom’s side seems to live a long time, though. Really long. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: “Not very helpful” is an understatement. We need to get a clearer picture. You said your wife set up the surgery… do you know why you're having it?
PATIENT: Uh… to lose weight, obviously? I mean, that's the point, right? I've… been bigger for a while now. It’s hard to get around, harder to do things. My wife… she worries about my health. She says I need to get this done before it gets worse. I guess I just… trust her. I know it's important, I just… didn't really think about the reasons, if that makes sense. She handled all the details with the doctor, so I mostly just went along with it. I know I should know more, I just… don’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. This is… concerning. Do you have any idea what your BMI is?
PATIENT: BMI? I… no. Is that a number? My wife talks about numbers sometimes, but I don’t usually pay attention. I just know I'm… bigger than I should be. I haven’t really weighed myself in a while. I try not to. It’s… depressing. She keeps saying I need to lose a certain amount, but I don’t know what that amount is. I’m really sorry, I feel like I’m just making this harder for you.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Kochubey, with all due respect, this surgery is a significant medical procedure. The fact that you have no idea why you’re having it, your BMI, or even your basic medical history… it's a problem. A serious problem. Before we proceed, I need you to speak with your wife and get a clear understanding of everything involved. We need to know your current weight, height, and a complete list of any past medical conditions. This isn’t something we can just gloss over. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. I… I understand. I feel bad, honestly. I didn't realize it was this important for me to know. I just… let my wife handle everything. I'll talk to her tonight, and I'll try to get all the numbers and stuff. I'll write it down this time, I promise. I just… I really appreciate you telling me this. I didn't want to mess anything up. I guess I just… trust her a lot. Maybe too much. I'll get the information, though. I promise. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Please do. And Mr. Kochubey?
