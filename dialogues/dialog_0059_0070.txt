DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Chagaris, you say? Sounds… foreign. Anyway. I just moved here. Need… the healthcare. Old one, not good. Medicare, you know? Social thing. I do makeup. For… shows. Theaters. Not fancy, mostly. Just need to make sure everything is okay, with the… the system.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, Chagaris is Czech, originally. And it’s perfectly alright to want to establish care with a new physician after a move. It's very wise to do so. We'll certainly get everything sorted out for you with Medicare. So, to clarify, you're looking for a general health check-up to ensure everything is functioning well now that you've relocated?
PATIENT: Check-up… yes. I guess. It’s not like I’m sick sick. Just… old. Things creak, you know? And I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time. Honestly, they were not good doctors before. Always rushing. This place… seems… cleaner.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to find a practice you feel comfortable with. And "creaking" is perfectly normal as we get older – it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’ll take our time and do a thorough assessment. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh, boy. That’s… a long time ago. I broke my arm when I was a kid. Climbing a tree. Stupid tree. And… I had the… the sickness. Everyone had it, back then. Flu, I think. Very bad flu. After that… nothing much. I eat, I sleep, I work. Maybe some aches and pains, but who doesn’t? I don’t remember any… serious things. Honestly, I mostly remember the makeup.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm as a child and a bout of the flu. That’s a good starting point. And it sounds like you’ve been generally healthy since then, which is excellent. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. Never had a problem with… anything. Maybe a little sniffle with dust, but everyone gets that, right? No… no special allergies. I use a lot of… creams and powders for the makeup, but never reacted. Good quality stuff, mostly. Expensive, but worth it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies are helpful. And thank you for mentioning the makeup – we'll keep that in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Bad for the… the system, you know? My wife, she was always taking pills. Always complaining. Vitamins? Maybe sometimes, a little multi-vitamin. But not regularly. Mostly, I just drink tea. Black tea. Strong. Helps with the… energy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. That’s good. And thank you for mentioning the tea – it’s good to be aware of those things. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… history? Oh, that's a sad story. My mother… she died young. Something with the… heart, I think. My father, he lived a long time. Very stubborn man. Smoked too much. And my sister… she moved to America. Haven’t seen her in years. Everyone always complaining about something. Not much healthy in my family, honestly. Lots of… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there’s been some health challenges in your family. We appreciate you sharing that with me. It's helpful to know about a history of heart issues and smoking, even if you don't have detailed information. To get a better sense of your current health, I'd like to ask you a few questions about how you've been feeling lately. Have you experienced any recent changes in your appetite, weight, sleep patterns, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Appetite is okay. I like to eat. Maybe a little less than before, but who doesn’t slow down with age? Weight… probably a little heavier. Need to watch that. Sleep… not great. Always waking up. Too much thinking. And energy… comes and goes. Good days, bad days. Like the weather. Nothing… dramatic. Just old. It’s just… getting old, doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some common changes associated with aging. And you're right, it's perfectly normal to have fluctuations in appetite, weight, sleep, and energy levels. Now, let's talk a bit about your daily life. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Typical day… well, I wake up. Drink tea. Strong tea. Then I work. Makeup, you know? I do makeup for… for people. Sometimes shows, sometimes… portraits. It’s not fancy work, but it pays the bills. I walk to the shop for groceries. And then… I watch television. Mostly news. Very depressing. And then I go to bed. Not much excitement. It’s… quiet.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fairly active day, despite the quiet nature of some of your activities. It’s good that you’re able to stay busy. Now, just to get a complete picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall physical condition. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam… hmm. I don’t like doctors poking around. Always felt… invasive. But… I guess it’s necessary, right? If you have to. Just… be gentle, okay? And don’t take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I understand your hesitation. We’ll take things slowly and I will be as gentle as possible. It shouldn’t take long. I'll explain everything as I go. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. But if it hurts, I’m telling you. Don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, your blood pressure is 145/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not an immediate cause for concern, but we may want to investigate further with an EKG, just to be safe. Your lungs sound clear, but there is some slight diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes.
PATIENT: Murmur? Diminished… what? Sounds bad. Always something. My mother had heart trouble, you know. Is it serious? Don't tell me I need surgery. I don't like hospitals. And what’s an… EKG? More poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, let’s not jump to conclusions. A murmur simply means there's some extra sound when your heart beats. It can be perfectly harmless, but we want to rule out anything serious. Diminished breath sounds could be related to a number of things, including age or slight congestion. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a very simple, painless test. We just attach a few small stickers to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s non-invasive and provides us with valuable information. It's a precaution, to get a better picture of your overall heart health. We're not talking about surgery at this point, not at all. It’s simply a routine test to get a baseline. Your abdomen feels soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Do you experience any pain there?
PATIENT: Tenderness… sometimes. After I eat. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling. Maybe it’s the tea? I drink a lot of tea. Very strong tea. My wife used to say I drank too much tea. Always complaining. And… what about the EKG? When do you do it? Will it take long? I have… things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: It could be related to the tea, or something else. We'll explore that further. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant could be from several things. We can do the EKG right here in the office, Mr. Szmyd. It will only take about 5-10 minutes. A technician will come in and place the stickers, and then we’ll get the results shortly after. It's a quick and painless procedure. While we wait for the technician, could you tell me a bit more about your diet besides the tea?
PATIENT: Diet… I eat. Mostly… soup. And bread. Sometimes potatoes. I don’t cook much. Too much trouble. I used to eat more meat, but it’s expensive now. And my wife… she did all the cooking. Always complaining about the prices. Now I just… get what’s easy. Not much fancy food. And I like sweets. Chocolate. When I can afford it.
DOCTOR: Alright, soup, bread, potatoes, and occasional sweets. We'll keep that in mind. Here’s Maria, our technician. She’s going to perform the EKG for you now. It won't take long, Mr. Szmyd. Maria, this is Mr. Szmyd. Please explain the procedure to him. The technician will need to attach these small stickers to your chest. They won't hurt, and the procedure is very quick and painless. Just let us know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Stickers… everywhere? Always something. Just… be quick about it. And don’t poke me too much. I have sensitive skin, you know. My wife… she always said I had sensitive skin. Always complaining.
DOCTOR: Maria is very experienced and gentle, Mr. Szmyd. She'll explain everything as she goes. Please take your time and explain the procedure to Mr. Szmyd. It’s just a quick way to get some information about your heart, Mr. Szmyd. We'll have the results shortly.
PATIENT: Just hurry up. This is… uncomfortable. My wife… she would have complained about this. Always complaining. Don’t poke me too hard. And what happens after this? Will you poke me some more? I don’t like doctors.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Mr. Szmyd. Maria is very careful. How are we doing?
PATIENT: There! Is it done yet? This is… awful. I feel like a… a science experiment. My wife… she would have… Never mind. Just tell me when it’s over.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’re all set. Just relax and breathe normally for a few minutes. The machine will do the rest. We’ll have the results in just a moment. It's a good idea to be quiet and still during the recording. Let me know when the tracing is complete. This is almost finished, Mr. Szmyd. Just a few more seconds.
PATIENT: Always something. Always poking and prodding. My wife… she would have… Oh, never mind. Just get it over with. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, the EKG is finished. Okay, let’s take a look at these results. The EKG shows some signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, which means the muscle of the left ventricle is slightly thickened. There's also a slight abnormality in the ST segment, which could indicate some previous ischemia. It’s not a definitive diagnosis, but it does warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I recommend a cardiac consultation with a cardiologist. They can perform additional tests, such as an echocardiogram and a stress test, to assess your heart function and identify any potential blockages. What are your thoughts on that, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Cardio… what? Echo… what? Blockages? Is this… serious? My wife… she had heart trouble, you know. She always complained about her chest. Is this like hers? I don’t want any… tests. I just wanted a check-up. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. It's natural to feel worried when you hear terms like that. Let me explain. A cardiologist is a specialist who focuses on the heart. An echocardiogram is a painless ultrasound of your heart – it allows us to see its structure and function. The EKG results suggest some possible changes, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have the same condition as your wife. It simply means we need to investigate further to get a clearer picture. We'll need to rule out any potential problems. I can order some blood tests, too. It is often the case that mild changes on an EKG are nothing to worry about. And as for cost, we can discuss that with your insurance provider and explore options to make it affordable. I will write you a referral to a cardiologist, Dr. Novak. She’s a very good doctor, and we can discuss your concerns with her. Would you like me to explain more about what a cardiologist does?
PATIENT: Dr. Novak… another doctor. More tests. More money. My wife… she always complained about the doctors. Always said they didn’t listen. I just… I just want to be healthy. Is this going to take long? I have things to do, you know. And what if it's bad? What if it's like my wife? I don't want to end up… like her.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties, Mr. Szmyd. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and worried. It’s good that we’re addressing this now, so we can get a clear understanding of your health and take appropriate steps. Let’s take things one step at a time. The referral to Dr. Novak will allow us to get a more detailed assessment of your heart. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive test, and it usually takes about 30-60 minutes. We will know more after that test is done. Regarding your concerns about ending up like your wife, let’s not jump to conclusions. Every case is different, and we have a lot of tools at our disposal to manage heart health. I will do everything I can to ensure you receive the best possible care. I will write you a referral to Dr. Novak today, and I will also order some blood tests to check your cholesterol and other important markers. The blood tests can be done at the lab across the street. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment with Dr. Novak?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Schedule the appointment. But… make it quick. And… I don’t want to wait too long. I have… things to do. And… can you tell me about Dr. Novak? Is she… nice? My wife… she didn’t like doctors who weren’t nice. Always complained about them.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. Let me see… Dr. Novak has an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… fine. Two o'clock. As long as it doesn't take all day. Just… get it over with. And make sure she’s… nice. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, I’ve scheduled your appointment with Dr. Novak for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Here is the referral slip, and these instructions detail how to get the blood tests done across the street. Dr. Novak is a very compassionate and experienced cardiologist. She takes the time to listen to her patients and explain things thoroughly. I believe you'll be in good hands. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… I hope it’s nothing. And… I hope she’s nice. I just want to be healthy. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. We'll do everything we can to get you the answers you need and help you stay healthy. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. I guess. Goodbye. Always something. Always.
