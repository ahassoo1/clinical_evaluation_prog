DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I guess. Honestly? I’m just…tired. Really tired. It's been going on for…a while now. I don't even know how long, really. Everything just feels…heavy, you know? It's hard to explain. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very frustrating when you feel that way, Ms. Licano – just a general sense of heaviness and fatigue. “A while now” is helpful, but could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics… See, that’s the problem! It’s…before my husband passed, definitely. But…was it right after? A few months? Longer? I really can't remember. Everything feels…blurry, like looking through a fog. It's just…constant. I wake up tired, I'm tired all day, and I go to bed tired. It's exhausting being exhausted, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly appreciate how difficult that must be, especially after such a loss. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, and fatigue is a very common symptom. But we want to be thorough and rule out any other potential causes. So, let’s try to pinpoint things a bit more. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm…well, I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible headaches, just…a dull ache. And I feel a little…achier than I used to. Like my bones are tired, if that makes sense? I don't have a fever or anything. Just…generally unwell. And I… I forget things a lot. More than usual, I think. Though, honestly, I’ve always been a bit forgetful.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, achiness, and some increased forgetfulness. That's helpful. And when you say "forgetfulness", can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh, geez…let me think. Just…little things. Like…I went to the grocery store yesterday, and I completely forgot what I went for when I got there! Had to go back home to check my list. And… sometimes I have trouble remembering people’s names, even people I’ve known for a while. It’s…embarrassing, really. It’s not like a big, sudden thing, just…small gaps. And I'm sure I'm forgetting even more things that I don't even realize!
DOCTOR: Okay, small memory lapses, difficulty recalling names…that’s good information. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really. I had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles…nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was years and years ago. Oh! And I have…arthritis, I guess. But it’s not bad. Just a little stiffness in my hands sometimes. I don’t take anything for it regularly. That’s about it, I think. And I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, gallbladder removal, and some arthritis. I see your Medicare information as well. Now, regarding medications, are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a while back. Said I didn't need it anymore. I take a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. And…sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s about it. Nothing regularly, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications besides occasional ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little sniffly in the spring, but I just figured that was…hay fever, you know? Nothing serious. No reactions to any medications that I can recall. I've never had to go to the hospital for an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of your situation, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, since my husband passed. He didn’t like it. And I certainly don’t do any… that sort of thing. I’m a pharmacy technician, Doctor! I work with medications, I don't…
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. I apologize for asking, Ms. Licano, it's just standard procedure. And it’s good to hear you are a pharmacy technician; that certainly gives you a good understanding of medications. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mother had…heart trouble, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… well, he had a bit of everything as he got older. Arthritis, high blood pressure… just old age, really. My brother is still alive, but he doesn't really talk about his health much. I don’t think there’s anything… major that runs in the family, if that makes sense. Just… general old age problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother, and general age-related conditions in your father. That is helpful. Now, Ms. Licano, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh… I guess. If you have to. I’m not a big fan of doctors, to be honest. It’s just… a lot of poking and prodding. But…if it’ll help me figure out what’s wrong, then go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. That’s within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your throat, ears, and nose. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Ears and nose appear normal. Finally, I will palpate your abdomen and check your reflexes. Abdomen is soft and non-tender, no masses detected. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However, I would like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what is going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, good. That wasn’t so bad. Blood work… yeah, okay. If you think it'll help. I just… I want to feel better, you know? What kind of blood work are we talking about? I always get nervous about needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Ms. Licano. We’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. We'll order a complete blood count – that checks for things like anemia and infection – a comprehensive metabolic panel – that looks at your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – and a thyroid stimulating hormone test – to check your thyroid function, as fatigue can sometimes be related to thyroid problems. We will also check your Vitamin D levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like a lot. But… okay. If you think it's necessary. Vitamin D… I do try to get some sun, but I mostly work indoors. Okay, yes. Do what you think is best. Just…tell me when it’s going to happen, so I can prepare myself. And please, be quick with the needle!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. I will make sure the phlebotomist is aware of your anxiety and will do their best to make it as quick and painless as possible. They'll let you know before they start, and you can tell them if you’re feeling uncomfortable at any time. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get a little more sunlight if possible, and ensuring you're getting enough fluids and rest. While we wait for the results, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just…thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. I’ve just… been feeling so tired for so long. I really hope we can figure out what’s going on. I guess…I’ll just wait for the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. I understand how frustrating it can be to feel this way, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of it. The lab results should be available in a few days. Our office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Licano.
