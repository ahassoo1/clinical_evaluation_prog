DOCTOR: Hi Yamir, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Just… need check for referee. For sports. I referee basketball. Need to be… fit. Want to do this quick, if okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, quick check-up for sports refereeing. I can definitely do that. Just to be clear, you want me to assess your overall health to make sure you’re cleared for basketball refereeing?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Health good for… running, jumping. Not… bricklaying. I fix fire… stuff. But need run for basketball. You understand? Is good to be fast.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. So, we’re focusing on cardiovascular fitness and musculoskeletal health – making sure you can handle the running and jumping. No need for bricklaying checks today! Let’s start with a quick history. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, in the last month or so?
PATIENT: No. No sickness. Maybe… little tired sometimes. Work hard. Hot work. But no… cold. No flu. Just… work. Everything okay with… heart? I worry about heart. Old man have problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illnesses, just some fatigue from work. And you're understandably concerned about your heart, given your family history. We'll definitely check that out. Can you tell me a little more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: It's... hard to explain. Like… heavy legs. After work, very tired. Need sit. Need sleep. Not… pain. Just… slow. Before, I run easy. Now… not so easy. It happen maybe… six months ago? Slowly get worse. Nothing big. I still work. Still referee. But… harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset of fatigue, over about six months, mostly noticeable after work. It feels like heavy legs and makes running more difficult. No pain, just… slower. That’s helpful. Do you notice any shortness of breath with exertion, like when you're running or climbing stairs?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Not… always. When I run very fast, maybe. But normal speed, okay. Stairs… sometimes a little… puff. Old building, many stairs. Maybe just stairs. Not running. You understand? It's hard to say. It’s not… bad. Just… notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent shortness of breath with significant exertion – running fast, or a lot of stairs. Not with normal activity. That helps me get a clearer picture. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: No. No. Doctor check me before, for work. Everything okay. Normal. No… asthma. No… sugar problems. Just… work. Always work. Never sick. I think. Maybe little headache sometimes, but everyone have headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. Routine work physicals have been normal. Just occasional headaches. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. No hospital. No surgery. I… careful. Don't like hospital. Always avoid. Just… fix fire stuff. Sometimes burn little, but not… hospital burn. Small burn. Bandage. Everything okay. No big problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Just minor burns treated with bandages. That's good. Now, about your family… Do any of your close family members have any medical conditions – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: My… father, he have heart problem. Old. Very old. Had… operation. Many years ago. Still alive, but… slow. Mother… she okay. Healthy. But she… not run. Never exercise. Just… cook. My brother… healthy too. I think. We don't talk much. He live far away. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had heart surgery in the past, but is still alive. Your mother is healthy, and your brother appears to be healthy as well. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergy. I eat everything. Sometimes spicy food, make me… sweat. But not allergy. No medicine allergy. Doctor give me something for burn sometimes, but okay. No problem. Everything okay. Just… careful. I careful with fire. And careful with… running now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No medicine. Nothing. Just… water. And… sometimes tea. Green tea. For energy. But not… medicine. Nothing special. I like simple. No pills. No… anything. Just work and… referee. Is enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. So, no medications, no allergies, and a family history of heart problems with your father. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Okay. Fast? You do fast? I have… game tonight. Need finish quick. Is okay. Check heart, check… everything. Fast, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Overall, your exam is pretty unremarkable. But given your fatigue and your father's history, I’d like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don't like tests. Long time. I have… referee game. Is just… fatigue. Maybe need sleep. Tests… long. You sure? Is really need?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time commitment. It’s not something I do lightly. I want to rule out any underlying issues contributing to your fatigue, especially given your family history and your desire to stay physically active. I’m thinking a basic blood test – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – to check your overall health, electrolyte levels, and kidney function. And an EKG – a quick, painless test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. It’ll give us a better understanding of your heart health. These are relatively quick tests, and I can get the results back quickly. It’s better to be safe and have a clear picture, right?
PATIENT: Okay… blood and… EKG. Fast? How long? And… expensive? I don’t have… much money. Just referee. And fix fire. Not… doctor money. If long time, maybe… no. Maybe just sleep. Is okay.
DOCTOR: I understand your financial concerns completely. The blood test and EKG shouldn't take more than 30 minutes total, and I can order them at the lab just down the street. As for cost, let me check your insurance coverage for you. Okay, it looks like your insurance covers both tests with a reasonable copay. I can also see if we can find a lower-cost lab option if needed. We can also discuss modifying your activity level while we wait for the results. It’s important to listen to your body. We don’t want to push yourself too hard. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Insurance… okay. Good. If not much money, okay. And… not run so hard? Until… tests? Okay. That… acceptable. Just need referee game tonight. Important game. Can… do game tonight? If I… careful? Just… no fast running. Easy referee.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You can still referee your game tonight, as long as you’re mindful of your exertion level. Avoid fast running and intense activity. Stick to easy refereeing – the normal pace. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, stop immediately. I’ll order the blood test and EKG for you now. The lab will send the results directly to me. We can schedule a quick follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay. Good. No fast. Easy. I remember. Follow-up… okay. When? Not… too long? I have… many games. Busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Let’s schedule a follow-up for three days from now – August 5th?
PATIENT: Okay. August 5th. Good. Three days. I remember. Is okay. Thank you, Doctor. I go now. Lab… down street? Easy to find?
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab is just two blocks down Main Street. It’s on the left-hand side, next to the bakery. You can’t miss it. Alright, Yamir. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before our follow-up appointment. And remember, take it easy tonight. Have a good game, and I’ll see you on August 5th.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Easy game. Bye bye.
