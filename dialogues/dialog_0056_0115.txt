DOCTOR: Hi Annelle, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s gone rather yellow, hasn’t it? A friend suggested I come see someone. Something about my liver… I don't recall all the details, truthfully. It’s been a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing of the skin… that's definitely something we want to look into. It could be related to your liver, as your friend mentioned, but there are other possibilities too. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When… Honestly, it feels like a few weeks now? Perhaps longer. Time slips away, you know. It started subtly, I think. Just a slight change in my complexion. I didn’t pay it much mind at first, thought it was just the lighting. But then my friend, Fatima, she noticed… and she insisted I come in. Is it… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good Fatima encouraged you to get it checked out. It’s always best to be sure. It can be serious, yes, but it also might be something relatively straightforward. We need to figure out the cause. A few weeks… okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the yellowing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I’ve been feeling… rather tired, I suppose. More so than usual. And a bit of… discomfort, up under my ribs, on the right side. Not pain, exactly. Just… heavy. And my appetite hasn’t been very good. But I’ve always had a small appetite, so… I don't know if that's new. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. Fatigue, discomfort under the right ribs, and decreased appetite… those could all be related. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh… now you're asking about things I haven't paid attention to! I really don't know. I suppose… they look normal? I haven’t specifically looked, if you understand. I'm afraid I'm not very observant when it comes to those sorts of things. Is it important, Doctor? I feel rather foolish admitting this…
DOCTOR: No, don't feel foolish at all! It's perfectly normal not to routinely check those things. It's just helpful information for me. Okay, let's move on then. Have you had any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss. If anything, I think I’ve gained a little. Perhaps because I haven’t been eating much. But definitely no weight loss. I'm afraid I'm not very good at remembering these things… It’s all a bit of a muddle. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We are, Annelle, we are. It's okay if things are a muddle, we’ll sort through it together. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Medical history. That was… a long time ago. I had something with my gallbladder, many years ago. They removed it, I think. And… I believe I had hepatitis once, a long, long time ago. But it was so long ago, and I don’t recall the details. I was young then, and my mother handled all the arrangements. I don’t even remember which kind of hepatitis it was… Is that important, Doctor? I'm so sorry I'm not more helpful.
DOCTOR: That is important, thank you. Both the gallbladder removal and the hepatitis are very relevant. Do you remember approximately when you had the hepatitis?
PATIENT: Oh… that was… in my twenties, I believe. Perhaps early thirties. A long, long time ago. It was before I came to this country, actually. We didn’t have good doctors where I was then. It wasn’t a serious case, I don’t think. I recovered… eventually. I just… don’t remember the specifics. It feels like a lifetime ago, Doctor. And I wasn't paying attention to the details then; I was more worried about… other things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I believe in letting nature take its course. I do take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that's all. Nothing regularly. And certainly nothing for this… this yellowing. I haven’t taken anything, Doctor. I truly haven’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, and I've never had a bad reaction to any medication. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I’ve never needed to worry about allergies, Doctor. It’s another thing I don’t have to concern myself with.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s difficult. My family is… scattered. I haven’t seen most of them in many years. I know my mother had some problems with her liver, later in life. But I don’t know the specifics. She passed away a long time ago. And my father… well, he passed away even longer ago. I don’t remember much about his health. It’s all a bit of a blur, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. Is this enough, Doctor? I'm rather tired now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Annelle. You've given me a lot of good information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s wrong with me, and what can be done about it. Please, go ahead. I’ll try to be still. But I do apologize in advance if I fidget. My bones ache a little these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is a little tender in the upper right quadrant, and I can feel some slight enlargement of your liver. It’s not dramatically enlarged, but it’s noticeable. I also notice some mild jaundice in your skin and the whites of your eyes, which is consistent with the yellowing you described. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it sounds like we need to investigate the possibility of liver problems further. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your liver function and rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. We might also need to do an ultrasound of your liver and gallbladder to get a better look at them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that is tender, isn’t it? I hadn’t realized… Ultrasound… blood tests… Yes, yes, whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s unsettling not knowing. Will the blood tests be painful? I don’t like needles. And how long will it take to get the results? I’m rather anxious, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Annelle. The blood tests will involve a small needle prick, it's usually quick, and most people don't find it very painful. The phlebotomist is very skilled. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to get them back from the lab. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. Given your symptoms and the tenderness in your upper right quadrant, I'm going to recommend that you avoid alcohol completely, and stick to a light diet for now - avoid fatty or fried foods. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No alcohol… light diet… Yes, I can do that. I rarely drink anyway. And I’m not fond of fried foods. Will this… this jaundice… will it go away? Is it serious, Doctor? You said cautious… that worries me. I don’t want anything serious. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, and I don’t want to spend my remaining years worrying about illness. Is there… is there anything I should be really concerned about? Please, be honest with me.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're asking these questions, Annelle. You deserve honest answers. The jaundice can go away, but it depends on what's causing it. We need those blood tests to determine that. The reason I said cautious is that jaundice can be caused by a variety of things, some more serious than others. It could be something relatively benign, like a temporary inflammation, but it could also be a sign of a more significant liver problem, such as blockage of the bile ducts or chronic liver disease. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s important to rule out all possibilities. We'll start with the blood tests and ultrasound. Once we have those results, we’ll have a much clearer picture of what’s going on and can discuss the best course of action. I'll explain everything thoroughly at that point. For now, try to rest, eat a light diet, and avoid alcohol. I'm going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist as well. They specialize in digestive issues and liver problems, and it's good to have a specialist involved from the beginning. Would you like me to go over the referral information with you now?
PATIENT: A specialist… Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. A gastroenterologist… I suppose it’s better to be thorough. If you wouldn’t mind going over the referral information with me, Doctor, I’d appreciate it. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being honest with me. It’s comforting to know you’re taking this seriously. I just… I just want to feel better. This uncertainty is… unsettling. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Annelle. It’s my job to make sure you feel heard and get the best possible care. Okay, this is a referral to Dr. Khalil, a gastroenterologist located about 20 minutes from here. His office number is 555-123-4567. The referral includes the results of our initial exam and the blood tests we’re going to order today. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. They usually require insurance information, but since you mentioned you’re not insured, just let them know, and they can discuss payment options with you. Here’s a printed copy of the referral information for you, including the address and contact details. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
