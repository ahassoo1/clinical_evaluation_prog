DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Hmm. Brings me in… well, it’s a rather… delicate matter. Not something one discusses easily, you understand. My wife insisted, of course. She always worries so. There seems to be… a bit of discharge. Yes, discharge. From… down there. It’s been going on for a few days now, and frankly, it’s quite bothersome. I haven't the slightest idea what’s causing it. I’ve never… well, it’s just not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly alright. These things happen, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It's not uncommon, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. When you say a few days, can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me think. It was after that garden party, I believe. Yes, the one the Millers threw. Awfully crowded, that was. Lots of… people milling about. Perhaps a week? Or was it closer to ten days? Time does rather slip away these days, you know. I’ve been feeling… a bit sluggish lately, generally. It's hard to pinpoint, truly. It wasn’t terribly noticeable at first, just a slight… dampness. Now it’s more… pronounced. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, roughly a week to ten days. And you’ve noticed it’s progressively getting worse. You mentioned feeling sluggish—anything else you've experienced along with that?
PATIENT: Sluggish… no, nothing immediately springs to mind. Though, my appetite hasn’t been quite what it used to be. My wife makes a lovely lamb stew, but I only managed a small portion last night. And I suppose I’ve been… a little more tired than usual. Though, at my age, one is always a little tired, isn’t one? I wouldn't say it's anything… alarming. Just… a general lack of vim and vigor. Is that what you medical people call it? Vim and vigor? I read it in a magazine once.
DOCTOR: “Vim and vigor” is a good way to put it, Mr. Krok. Loss of appetite and increased fatigue are good things to mention. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching associated with the discharge?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really. A slight discomfort, perhaps. Like a… a mild irritation. Nothing that would keep me up at night, certainly. Burning? No, no burning. Itching… well, sometimes, yes. A bit of an itch. But it comes and goes. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had worse itches from mosquito bites. It’s more… embarrassing than painful, if you understand. A gentleman doesn't generally discuss such things. My wife keeps telling me it could be some dreadful disease, but I assure you, I’ve lived a very… respectable life.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Mr. Krok. It's good you're able to be so open. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or changes in your urination – like more frequent trips to the bathroom, or difficulty going?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t felt warm in days. My wife checks my temperature regularly, you see. She's very conscientious. Chills? No, not at all. And… urination. Hmm. Now that you mention it, I may have been getting up once or twice more at night. But I always enjoyed a good glass of water before bed. Perhaps it’s just that. It’s difficult to say. At my age, things… fluctuate, you understand. I wouldn’t necessarily associate it with… this. Do you think it could be the water? I get it from the well.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the well water. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking about things I barely remember. Let me see… My wife handles most of the medical arrangements, you see. I had my prostate checked a few years back, that I recall. They said it was… enlarged. Nothing too serious, just… normal for a man my age. I believe I had high blood pressure at one point, but they put me on a little pill. I take it every morning. Can’t recall the name of it. And… hmm. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is why I walk with a cane. Other than that… honestly, I’ve been quite fortunate. I've always been a robust fellow, despite my age. Do you need the names of the medications? My wife has a list, I’m sure. She keeps everything so organized.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Krok. Knowing about the prostate, high blood pressure, and arthritis is good. And yes, if you wouldn’t mind, having the name of the blood pressure medication would be excellent. It's alright if you don't remember, we can check your medication list. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. Yes, I believe I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… hmm. Oh, yes! I had a cataract removed from my left eye a few years back. That was a great success. My vision is much improved. Other than those two… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been careful to avoid unnecessary procedures. My wife insists on a second opinion for everything, you see. She’s a very… thorough woman. Do you need the dates of these surgeries? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family - like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That's a bit complicated. My father, he was a very strong man, lived to a ripe old age. I believe he had some trouble with his heart towards the end, but I’m not certain. My mother… she passed away when I was young, I’m afraid. I don't recall any specific illnesses. I had several siblings, but we weren't particularly close. We all lived very separate lives. I don't believe anyone in my family suffered from anything particularly… noteworthy. Mostly just old age and the usual aches and pains. My wife might know more about it. She’s very good at remembering these things. She keeps a detailed family tree, you see. Do you need to know the names of my siblings? It’s all rather… distant now.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly fine if you don’t have all the details. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him. Dreadful habit. As for alcohol… I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. A very small glass, mind you. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’ve always been a law-abiding citizen. I wouldn’t dream of it. I lead a very quiet and respectable life. Gardening, mostly. And reading. And spending time with my wife, of course. I’ve always believed in moderation, you see. It’s the key to a long and healthy life. Or so my mother used to say.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. My wife always checks with the pharmacist before I take anything new. She’s very careful, you see. I might be a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, but that’s just a minor irritation. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a severe allergic reaction, thankfully. I’ve always considered myself to be quite robust, despite my age. Are you sure you need to know all of these details, Doctor? It seems like a lot of questions. But I’m happy to answer them, of course. I want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That was very thorough. I ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health, and you’ve been very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment implicitly. Though, I must warn you, my knees aren't what they used to be. It might be a little… awkward getting up and down. I'll do my best to cooperate, of course. Just please be gentle. And do let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I’m happy to assist in any way I can. I suppose it's time to poke and prod, is it? Oh well, such is life.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a quick exam. We'll take it slow. If you’re comfortable, please lie down on the table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to lie down. Though, I confess, I’m not terribly graceful these days. There. Is that satisfactory? Do let me know if I need to adjust myself in any way. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels… uncomfortable. I’m at your service. A bit of a creak here and there, you know, just the old bones protesting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit of a murmur is present. That’s not uncommon at your age. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Murmur, you say? Oh dear. Is that serious, Doctor? I suppose I should have mentioned it to my wife. She always insists on knowing everything. No, no tenderness here. Just a bit… firm. I’ve always had a bit of a paunch, you see. It’s the wine, I suspect. A bit higher, perhaps? Just be careful. It’s a bit sensitive after lunch. Are we getting closer to the… problematic area? I’d rather not dwell on it, if you don't mind. It's a bit embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: No significant tenderness, as you said, just a bit firm. I’m not detecting anything alarming. Now, I’m going to examine the groin area. This may be a bit uncomfortable, but it’s important to rule out any swollen lymph nodes. It’s important to check for any swelling or tenderness in this area. Is this area particularly sensitive, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh. Goodness. That… well. That is rather personal, isn’t it? No, not particularly sensitive, Doctor. Just… awkward. My wife always tells me to be open and honest with the doctor, but this is… a bit much, even for me. No swelling that I can detect, though I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for. I confess, I'm a bit flustered. Perhaps we could move on to something else? Are you finished with that area yet? I'd greatly appreciate it if we could proceed with the examination. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Krok. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. We can absolutely move on. Let's just finish by checking your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is normal for your age. Alright. Based on the quick exam, everything appears relatively normal, though we still need to discuss the discharge you mentioned. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or pain associated with it since we started talking?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And the pain is… minimal, as I said. Just a slight discomfort. Though, I must confess, I am feeling a little… agitated now. It’s not the physical examination, necessarily. It’s the… conversation. It’s just a bit embarrassing, you know? I feel like I’m divulging far too much personal information. My wife would be horrified if she knew what we've discussed. Perhaps we could focus on the cause of the discharge, instead of dwelling on the symptoms? Is it something serious, Doctor? That’s what I really want to know. Am I in any danger?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel embarrassed. I assure you, everything we discuss is confidential. It’s important for me to gather all the information to provide you with the best possible care. Now, regarding the discharge, it could be a number of things. Given your age and the mild discomfort you’re experiencing, it’s unlikely to be something serious, but we need to rule out any potential infections or other causes. I’d like to collect a urine sample to test for a urinary tract infection, and I’d also like to take a swab of the discharge to send to the lab for analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine sample and a swab… oh dear. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? It feels like such an invasion of privacy. But… if it’s the only way to determine the cause, then I suppose I have no choice. Very well. A urine sample and a swab. Where am I supposed to… obtain these samples? Do you have a… facility for such things? My wife always handles these logistical details. I’m afraid I’m a bit lost. And will it be… painful? I'm just a bit apprehensive, you know. This whole experience has been rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. We have a private restroom just down the hall. I’ll provide you with a sterile container for the urine sample and a swab kit. The restroom is completely private, and I’ll give you clear instructions on how to collect the samples. The process shouldn't be painful at all. Just a little bit of discomfort, perhaps. I’ll leave you to collect the samples, and I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all. Don’t rush, and take your time. Here are the instructions. Just read them carefully, and let me know if you have any questions. I'll be right outside.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Instructions… yes. It all seems rather… complicated. But I suppose I have no choice. I shall endeavor to follow the instructions to the best of my ability. Thank you for your assistance. And… thank you for your patience. This whole experience has been… a bit much. Please do let me know if I need any help.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: There. I believe I have everything. It was… rather awkward, to be honest. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you know. And… well, it’s just not a dignified process. I hope I collected the samples correctly. Do they look… adequate? I’m terribly sorry if I’ve made a mess of things. My wife would be horrified if she knew what I’ve been up to. Is there anything else I need to do? I’m ready to go home now, if you’ll allow it. This whole experience has been rather… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Everything looks perfectly fine, Mr. Krok. You did a great job. Don't worry about a mess; it’s all part of the process. Now, I'll send these samples to the lab for analysis. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – and avoiding any irritants like harsh soaps or detergents. We'll discuss the results when they come back, and we'll determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… reassuring. Plenty of fluids, you say? And avoid irritants. Yes, I can manage that. My wife always tells me to drink more water. She's very conscientious. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for your patience and your understanding. And… thank you for not judging me. It wasn’t easy coming in here today. I suppose I’ll be seeing you in a few days, then? Do let me know if there’s anything I need to do before my next appointment. I shall endeavor to be more prepared next time. Though, frankly, I hope there won’t be a next time. Good day to you, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. It was my pleasure. And don't worry, we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I’ll give you a call as soon as the results are back. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And… thank you again. Good day to you.
