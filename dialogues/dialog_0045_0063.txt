DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Billman. Good to meet you too. It’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual, and it’s…well, you see on the paper, I have the cancer, yeah? It’s just… hurting a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you have a history of… metastatic breast cancer. And you're saying this back pain is new, or a significant change from what you've experienced before?
PATIENT: Significant change. Definitely. Before, it was like…a dull ache, mostly. I could still do things. Work, walk around… now? It feels like someone is stabbing me, and it goes all the way down my leg sometimes. Makes it hard to even stand up straight. It started maybe two weeks ago, but got much worse in the last few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, stabbing pain…radiating down the leg. Two weeks, worsening in the last few days. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, yeah? But some times…when I move a certain way, or try to lift something, it gets really sharp. Then it's bad for a while. When I’m just sitting still, it’s still there, but not as bad. Like a heavy weight, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, a constant ache with sharp exacerbations with movement. And you mentioned it feels like a heavy weight… Can you point to exactly where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. Mostly on this side. And it feels like it’s going down my leg, like… here. Not all the way to my foot, but almost. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. It's not just on my back, it feels in my back, deep down.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized to the lower back, left side, radiating down the thigh. “Deep” pain, you said. Alright. Now, you have a history of metastatic breast cancer…has the pain changed at all since any recent treatments or scans?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. I had some…chemo, maybe six months ago? It helped for a while, the cancer shrunk. But then it started growing again, the doctor said. Last scan was…I think in May? It showed more spots, in my bones, they said. I don’t remember exactly what they said, it’s a lot to keep track of. But this back pain… it didn’t feel like this before the scan showed more spots.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of metastatic breast cancer and the recent progression of disease, coupled with this new onset of significant back pain… it’s concerning. We need to rule out some serious possibilities. I'm going to need to do a physical exam, and I’m going to order some imaging – an MRI of your spine, and likely some blood work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. An MRI… that’s the one where I have to lie in that… loud machine? I don't mind. I just want to know what's going on. I'm scared, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the one. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it's the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on with your spine. And you’re right to be concerned – it’s good to be proactive. We’ll get some answers. First, let’s do the exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. It hurts a little to lie down, if you don’t mind if I adjust… Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Take your time. Okay. I'm going to gently palpate your spine, to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Tell me if anything is particularly painful. And I'll also be checking your reflexes and range of motion. Just let me know what you feel. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ooh. Yeah. Right there. That’s… really sore. Like a deep ache, but sharp too. It feels like you're poking right on the spot. It makes me want to pull away. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness at L4-L5. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Range of motion is limited, especially with flexion and extension. Straight leg raise is positive on the left at about 30 degrees, reproducing your leg pain. Okay. Based on the exam, it’s consistent with nerve compression, likely due to something pressing on the nerve in your lower back. Given your history, we need to be concerned about a possible vertebral compression fracture or metastasis. The MRI will give us a much clearer picture. I’m going to order that now, and also some blood work – a complete blood count, and some markers to assess the cancer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That…makes sense. All that sounds alright. Nerve…compression? Is that…serious? And metastasis… that means the cancer is… in my back, right? I just… I'm scared of what it means.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared. Nerve compression can be serious, but it's also manageable in many cases. It means a nerve is being squeezed, which is causing your pain and radiating symptoms. The MRI will tell us exactly what is compressing the nerve. And yes, metastasis would mean the cancer has spread to the bones in your spine. But we won't know for sure until we get the results. It's important to remember that knowing what we’re dealing with allows us to create a plan, and there are treatments available to manage the pain and slow the progression of the disease. I'll be here to discuss all your options with you, once we have the results. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help with the discomfort. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah. A plan… that sounds good. Better than just… waiting. Pain reliever… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. And… how long until I get the results from the MRI? I’m just… trying to prepare myself. .
DOCTOR: The MRI facility should be able to schedule you within the next 24-48 hours. The radiologist usually reads the results within a day or two, and I’ll have them sent to me immediately. I’ll call you as soon as I’ve reviewed them, and we can schedule another appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan. Here’s a prescription for some ibuprofen, and a referral form for the MRI. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or if you have any questions or concerns. I know this is a lot to take in, and I’m here to support you. Do you have any questions for me right now?
