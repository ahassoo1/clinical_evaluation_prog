DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re 85 years old, so frankly, brevity is appreciated. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A rather direct approach, but I suppose efficiency has its merits. I’m here regarding…well, a dietary experiment, shall we say. A rather enthusiastic young man convinced me it was the path to renewed vigour. It involved, rather surprisingly, a great deal of cabbage.
DOCTOR: Cabbage. Yes, well. I daresay I’ve seen it all. And what, precisely, is the problem resulting from this…experiment?
PATIENT: The problem, Doctor, is…a rather persistent and unsettling gaseousness. And a distinct lack of social invitations, I might add. My dear Mildred – she's a neighbour, a widow – found the aroma…distracting, shall we say, during our bridge game yesterday. It’s all rather undignified, and I suspect it’s affecting my concentration. I used to be a rather keen strategist, you see. Not that anyone plays bridge properly anymore.
DOCTOR: Gaseousness. And Mildred's sensibilities, naturally. Right. Let's establish a timeline. When did this…cabbage consumption begin, and when did you notice these…effects?
PATIENT: Precisely three weeks ago, Doctor. Young Timothy – that's the enthusiast – presented his regimen with considerable zeal on the 17th of July. The…effects, shall we say, became noticeable approximately four days later. It started subtly, a gentle rumble, then escalated rather rapidly. One might compare it to a small, internal orchestra tuning up. A rather discordant orchestra, admittedly.
DOCTOR: So, three weeks of this…orchestra. Any other symptoms alongside this…flatulence?
PATIENT: Flatulence is perhaps a rather…clinical term, Doctor. But yes, alongside it, I've noticed a certain…bloating. An uncomfortable fullness, particularly after luncheon. And a slight, but persistent, feeling of…well, being rather thoroughly inflated. It’s rather distracting when one is attempting a watercolour, you see. The brushwork lacks precision. And Mildred, naturally, continues to avoid the garden.
DOCTOR: Bloating and…artistic impairment. Excellent. Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation accompanying this…cabbage-induced distress?
PATIENT: No nausea, Doctor, thankfully. Nor any…unpleasant expulsions of any kind beyond the…aerobic variety. Constipation, however, there has been. A rather stubborn resistance to…regularity, shall we say. It's quite at odds with the…opposite problem, if you follow me. A rather delicate balancing act, really. It’s all most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right. And you are taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of propranolol for a slightly erratic heartbeat, Doctor. Nothing significant, and it hasn't been altered in dosage for years. And a rather robust multivitamin, naturally. One must maintain one’s constitution, even at my age. And, of course, a small glass of sherry most evenings. For medicinal purposes, naturally.
DOCTOR: Propranolol, multivitamin, sherry. Predictable. Any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to anything, as far as I know. I’ve dined on a rather eclectic range of foods throughout my life. Escargots in Paris, durian in Malaysia, haggis in Scotland…all without incident. I’m rather proud of my robust digestive system, or, at least, I was proud of it. Before Timothy and his cabbage, naturally.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a listen to your abdomen, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I must warn you, it may not be entirely…harmonious at the present moment. A rather disconcerting rumble or two is to be expected. Do let me know if it sounds particularly alarming. I’ve always been a rather good judge of percussion, you see. Used to orchestrate sound effects for films, you know.
DOCTOR: Moderate tympany, some borborygmi… as expected. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Sounds reasonably normal, despite the…symptoms. Now, let's clarify one thing. How much cabbage are we talking about, precisely?
PATIENT: Ah, the crucial question, Doctor. Timothy’s regimen is rather…enthusiastic. Approximately a quarter of a head, boiled, every luncheon. And, he insisted, a generous portion of the water it was boiled in. He claimed it was rich in…nutrients. And, he said, particularly effective. I suppose one must admire his dedication, even if the results are…less than ideal.
DOCTOR: A quarter of a head with the water, every day for three weeks. Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, you’ve essentially subjected your digestive system to a chemical weapon. This is likely simple – albeit unpleasant – dietary gas. The plan is to cease the cabbage, and the water, immediately. And dramatically reduce fiber intake for a week. I am writing a prescription for simethicone – an over-the-counter anti-gas medication. Take as directed. And, for goodness sake, avoid Timothy.
PATIENT: A chemical weapon, Doctor? Rather a strong assessment, but perhaps not entirely inaccurate. I shall certainly heed your advice and discontinue the cabbage regimen…with immediate effect. And I shall, discreetly, distance myself from Timothy. He is a well-intentioned young man, but his enthusiasm is…unbounded. Simethicone, you say? I shall procure it at once. And thank you, Doctor, for your…frank assessment and guidance. Perhaps I should stick to watercolours and avoid any further culinary experiments.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If symptoms persist for longer than a week, or worsen, return for further evaluation. And, Mr. Vantine, please. No more cabbage. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly, Doctor. No more cabbage. A solemn vow. Thank you once again for your…vigilance. And your…rather effective cure. I believe I shall return to my easel immediately. And perhaps paint a landscape. A very safe landscape.
