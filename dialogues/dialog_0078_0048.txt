DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is the name. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I've been…forgetful, she says. Though I don’t see it. Just little things, you know? Mostly just…not remembering where I put my tools. A good tradesman always knows where his tools are, but…well. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It’s very common for spouses to notice changes in routine or memory before the person experiencing them does. And it’s good that your wife is looking out for you. "Little things" can sometimes be important. So, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about these instances of forgetting where your tools are?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I wander around lost, Doctor. I just…look in one place, and they aren't there. Then I look somewhere else. Happens maybe…two, three times a week? Used to be I’d know exactly where every chisel, every trowel was. Now…I have to think about it. And sometimes, even then…it takes a while. It's frustrating, more than anything. A man takes pride in his work, you know? And you can’t do good work if you’re fumbling around for a simple hammer.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Lason. It’s frustrating when something like that disrupts your routine and your pride in your work. It sounds like this has been a change from how you normally function, and that's good you brought it up. Besides the tools, have you noticed any other difficulties with your memory?
PATIENT: Difficulties…? Hmm. Let me think. My wife mentioned something about…repeating questions. I asked her what we were having for dinner, and she said I asked her twice within five minutes. But I don’t recall that. I mean, she makes a different meal almost every night. It's not like I need to memorize the menu, you know? I figured she just hadn’t noticed I’d asked already. Women…always noticing things. But, alright, maybe that happened. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Mr. Lason, but repeating questions can sometimes be a sign of a change in cognitive function. It's good that your wife has noticed, and that you’re willing to discuss it. To get a clearer understanding, let's do a quick review of your overall health. Have you experienced any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes…? Well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Just…getting old, you know? 66 years is a long time to be laying tile. My knees ache, my back aches…all the usual things. No fever, no dizziness. Appetite's good, though my wife keeps trying to get me to eat more fish. Says it's good for the brain. I like a good steak, myself. Brain seems to be working just fine, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. Fatigue and aches and pains are common with age, certainly. And it’s good to hear your appetite is good. It's helpful to rule out other possible causes for these changes. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical…hmm. Let’s see. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. Chickenpox, measles, you know, the usual childhood things. Nothing serious. Had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been fine ever since. Been seeing Dr. Chen for years, good man. He checks everything. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I’m a pretty healthy man, all things considered. Work hard, don’t drink much, don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: That’s all good information, Mr. Lason. It sounds like you've been proactive about your health, which is excellent. You mentioned medication for high blood pressure - do you know the name of that medication, and how much you take?
PATIENT: Let me think…Dr. Chen…he changed it a couple of times. Right now, I believe it's…Losartan. Yes, that’s it. 50 milligrams, once a day. Every morning with breakfast. I've been taking it for…oh, maybe five, six years now? I don't fuss with pills, Doctor. I just take what he tells me and get on with it. He's a good doctor, I trust him.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendix removal?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Appendix was when I was a boy, maybe eight years old. Just the one. Nothing since then. I’ve broken a bone or two, working, but nothing that needed a surgeon. Just a cast and some time to heal. I've always been careful, you know? A tradesman has to be. Can’t be clumsy with power tools.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Hmm. That’s a tough one. My parents…they both lived into their 80s, healthy enough. My mother, she had a bit of trouble with her memory towards the end, but they just said it was old age. My father, he was a strong man, worked with his hands his whole life. No real health problems. I have a brother, he lives in Phnom Penh, but we haven’t seen each other in years. Haven't spoken to him in a while...He’s always been a bit…distant. Don't really know much about his health, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Lason. It's common not to have detailed information about family health histories. Knowing what you do know is helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Maybe a beer with dinner once or twice a week. Sometimes. When the Red Sox win. My wife doesn't much like it, says it interferes with my sleep. So I don't push it. Never been much of a drinker, anyway. Don't need it. Always preferred a good strong cup of coffee. Keeps me going.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched it, Doctor. Never seen the point. My father, he smoked a little when he was younger, but he gave it up years ago. Said it didn't do him any good. I've always been careful about my health. A tradesman needs his lungs, you know? Dust, cement…all sorts of things to breathe in. Can't be messing with cigarettes on top of that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, just a few more questions about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I eat just about anything. My wife complains I don’t have a refined palate, but I figure if it tastes good, it’s good enough for me. Never had a reaction to any medicine, either. I just take what the doctor gives me and get on with it. I’m a pretty simple man, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Lason. It sounds like you have a pretty straightforward health history, which is helpful. Alright, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Whatever you need. I don't mind. Just tell me what you want me to do. I haven’t been feeling particularly well lately, so I'm glad you're looking into it. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. Just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your vital signs. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Careful now, these old bones don’t move as quickly as they used to. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason, your vital signs are within a normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, there you go. You listen away, Doctor. I always took pride in my lungs. Needed 'em for all the dust and cement. Hopefully they're still holding up alright.
DOCTOR: Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you cross your legs and let your knees relax?
PATIENT: There we go. A bit creaky, but they’re still working, I suppose. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, your reflexes, strength, and gait are all normal. I’m going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat now. I examine Mr. Lason’s ears, nose and throat. “Ears are clear bilaterally. Nasal mucosa is pink and moist. Throat is clear, no exudate.” Everything looks good there as well. Now, to finish up, I'm going to do a brief cognitive assessment. This will just involve some simple questions and tasks. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. As long as it’s not too complicated. My mind’s still sharp, I’ll have you know. Just a bit forgetful sometimes, that’s all. Go ahead, ask your questions. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with some simple recall questions. Can you tell me what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Today’s… August… the 2nd. Yes, August the 2nd. 2025, right? Yes, that's right. August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Well, now, that's a silly question, isn't it? We’re in…suburbia, right? That’s what the nice young lady on the phone said when I made the appointment. This is a suburban clinic, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's correct. Now, I’m going to ask you to remember three words. I will say them slowly, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I can still remember a few things.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: …Apple… table… um… hmm… what was the other one? It’s right on the tip of my tongue… table… apple… oh dear. It’s… penny! Yes, penny. Apple, table, penny. Is that right?
DOCTOR: That's good, Mr. Lason. You remembered them eventually. Now, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock face, showing the time at 10 past 11. I have a paper and pen here for you.
PATIENT: There we go. It's not a work of art, mind you. I'm a tradesman, not an artist. But it shows the time, doesn't it? Roughly, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. Thank you. That concludes the cognitive assessment. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the exam and assessment, it seems like you’re experiencing some mild cognitive difficulties, primarily with recall and some minor organizational skills. However, it's important to remember that this could be due to a number of factors, including age, stress, or other underlying medical conditions. Given your concerns about forgetfulness, I recommend we order some blood tests to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or other potential causes. I also think it would be helpful to get a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests I can handle, Doctor. Always good to know what’s going on inside. But an MRI…? That sounds a bit…serious. What exactly are we looking for? Is something wrong? I don’t like the sound of that, Doctor. I just want to make sure it's nothing too serious, you know? Old age, that's all it is, I hope.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. An MRI is not necessarily indicative of something serious. It's simply a way to get a more detailed look at your brain structure and rule out any underlying causes for your cognitive difficulties, such as small strokes or other changes. It’s a precautionary measure. We're looking for any signs of structural abnormalities, and to exclude other potential causes. We're not necessarily expecting to find anything, but it’s important to be thorough. I’d like to also refer you to a neurologist. A neurologist is a specialist in brain and nerve disorders, and can provide a more specialized evaluation and help us determine the best course of treatment. Would you be open to those recommendations?
PATIENT: A specialist, huh? Sounds… expensive. And more tests. I don’t like the sound of this getting more complicated. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I just thought maybe it was stress, or getting old. My wife worries too much. I suppose if you think it's important… I don’t want to ignore anything serious, but I also don’t want to go through a lot of hassle for nothing. What will these tests cost? And how long will all of this take? I have work to do, you know. I can't be spending all my time at the doctor's office.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and time, Mr. Lason. Let’s address those. The blood tests should be fully covered by Medicare, with a small co-pay, if any. As for the MRI and the neurological consultation, Medicare does cover those as well, but there may be a deductible or co-insurance depending on your plan. I can have our billing department contact your insurance company to get a more accurate estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. The neurologist will likely want to schedule an appointment within the next few weeks, and the MRI can usually be scheduled within a week or so. The appointments themselves shouldn’t take up too much of your time – typically an hour or so each. I want to assure you that we’re taking a cautious approach. We’re not assuming anything is seriously wrong, but it’s important to rule out any potential underlying causes for your concerns. The sooner we get a clearer picture of what’s going on, the sooner we can develop a plan to address it. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule those referrals for you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Alright. I suppose if you insist. Schedule the tests, schedule the specialist. Just… keep it as simple as possible, alright? And please, have the billing department call me directly. I want to know exactly how much this is going to cost before I agree to anything. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I'm a practical man. I need to know what I'm getting into. And if it turns out to be nothing serious… well, I’ll be glad I came. But I have work to do, you know. A man’s got to provide for his family.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I understand. I’ll make those arrangements right away, and I'll personally ensure the billing department contacts you directly with a detailed cost estimate. I’ll also provide you with a list of questions to ask the neurologist. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle – eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and stay mentally active. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. Here's a summary of what we've discussed today, and a written request for the blood tests and a referral to a neurologist. I hand Mr. Lason the paperwork. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all for now. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. Just old age, that's all. I'll wait to hear from your office about the tests and the specialist. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lason. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and ensure you receive the best possible care. I shake his hand warmly. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
