DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you are 32 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, 32. I… well, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and hungry too, even after I’ve eaten. It’s been… quite bothersome, to be frank. I’d like to get to the bottom of it, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: "Quite bothersome," yes. I understand. Thirst and increased appetite can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what might be going on, could you elaborate on when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It probably started… oh, around three or four weeks ago, I’d say. Maybe a bit longer. It wasn’t sudden, just… gradually got worse. At first, I just thought I was having a particularly warm spell, you know? But it’s continued even with the cooler weather.
DOCTOR: Three to four weeks, gradual onset... and has this increased thirst and appetite been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… not that I’ve noticed, not really. I’ve been a bit… tired, perhaps. But I work long hours, so I always chalk that up to that. And maybe a little more frequent trips to the lavatory, but again, I drink a fair bit now, so… I haven’t paid it much mind, to be honest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Erxleben, thank you. Increased urination alongside increased thirst is… noteworthy. Fatigue is rather nonspecific, as you say, but we’ll consider it. Now, could you describe a typical day of drinking for you?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I start with a large glass of water with my breakfast – that's fairly standard. Then, throughout the day at work, I'm constantly refilling my water bottle. Probably… oh, a litre and a half, maybe two litres total? It’s a busy job, shipping and receiving, and it gets quite dusty. And then, I'll usually have something to drink with my dinner. I don't drink much alcohol, if that’s what you mean. Mostly just water, tea, or the occasional juice. I'm trying to cut back on the juice, to be honest. Does that sound excessive?
DOCTOR: Two litres a day is... above average, certainly, but not necessarily alarming in and of itself, given your occupation. Let's move on to other aspects of your health. Do you have any known medical conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've always been fairly healthy, to be frank. Had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I haven’t been to the doctor in… well, probably five or six years, maybe longer. Just the odd check-up. Nothing major ever flagged. Divorced, busy work life, you know how it is. I’m not really one for dwelling on ailments. I’ll get it sorted if it becomes a problem.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. Broken a few bones as a lad – a sprained ankle, a fractured wrist – but nothing requiring an operation. Just casts and time to heal, thankfully. I’m fairly accident-prone, but nothing serious. I’m hoping this thirst business won’t require anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – diabetes, kidney problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… she had some sort of arthritis, I think. But beyond that, not that I’m aware of. My grandparents… they lived long lives, both of them. My father’s side is Scottish, as am I, and they were a hardy bunch. My mother’s side… I don't really know much about their medical history, to be honest. She didn’t talk about it much. It's not something we discussed.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once, didn’t agree with me. Not a smoker at all. And as I said, very little alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s about it. I’m a fairly active person, despite the long hours at work, so I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. I’m not particularly fussy, to be honest. I just want to get to the bottom of this thirst, if you don’t mind. I’m starting to get a bit worried about it, if I’m honest. It's just… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. I think we have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Get it over with as quickly as possible, if you please? I have a shipment coming in this afternoon that I need to oversee. But yes, go ahead. I’d appreciate getting this sorted quickly, if that’s feasible.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s begin with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and test your sensation. Reflexes are normal, sensation is intact. Do you notice any changes in your skin – any dryness, itching, or frequent infections?
PATIENT: No, not really. My skin feels… normal, I suppose. A bit rough from the work, perhaps, but nothing out of the ordinary. I work with a lot of dusty materials, as I said, so it’s always a bit dry. No itching or infections, thankfully. Just… work-roughened hands, that’s all. Is that significant? I’m not prone to skin problems, normally.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily significant, but it's good to know. Now, I'd like to order a few routine blood tests. This will help us assess your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolyte balance. Also, a urine sample would be helpful. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your increased thirst and appetite. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. The sooner we get some answers, the better. Blood tests and a urine sample, yes, absolutely. Where do I go to get those done? And how long will it take? I really need to be back at work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall to your left. The nurse will provide you with the necessary containers and instructions for the urine sample. The blood tests will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms—such as blurred vision, weakness, or confusion—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. 24 to 48 hours… right. As long as it’s nothing serious. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go and get those tests done right away. I appreciate your time. I’ll see you when the results are back. .
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Erxleben. Please let the nurse know if you have any difficulties. We will be in touch. Have a good day.
