DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been feeling… awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, constantly hungry, even after a good meal. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Thirsty and hungry, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It’s… difficult to explain. I just seem to be perpetually parched, and then, no matter what I eat, I feel the need for more food shortly after. It’s not like I’m trying to eat more, you understand. It just… happens. It's rather inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Well, let's attempt to get a clearer picture, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I do hope we can figure this out quickly; I have a rather full schedule, as it is. Would you like me to elaborate on anything specifically? Perhaps what I typically eat in a day?
DOCTOR: Not initially, no. Let’s begin with a more… systematic approach. Have you noticed any changes in your urination habits?
PATIENT: Urination habits? Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, actually. I suppose I have been going to the lavatory more often than usual. Not drastically, but… noticeably. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing to discuss, Doctor, but I suppose that’s your job. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Relevant indeed. And would you characterize this increased frequency as during the day, at night, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly during the day, Doctor. I wouldn't say it's woken me up at night, thankfully. Though, I’ve found myself needing to visit the facilities shortly after drinking a large glass of water, which is… counterproductive, given the thirst. It's a bit of a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Any pain or burning sensation during urination?
PATIENT: No, sir, none at all. Perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. No discomfort whatsoever. Just… more frequent visits. It doesn’t hurt, doesn't sting, nothing like that. Just… more of it. Is that… unusual? I do apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I'm not a medical man, you see.
DOCTOR: “Unusual” is a relative term, Mr. Erxleben. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Now that’s an interesting question. I… haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. But my clothes have been feeling a little looser around the waist, yes. Not a dramatic amount, mind you, but… noticeable enough that my wife—ex-wife, I should say—commented on it when I last saw her. I hadn't put much thought into it, thinking perhaps I was just eating less, but… now that you mention it… it’s possible. Would that be… concerning?
DOCTOR: Concerning is… a strong word. Let's move on. Any blurry vision or increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not that I've noticed. My eyesight’s never been particularly sharp, I’ve worn spectacles for years, but no change there. Fatigue, though… yes, actually. I’ve been feeling rather… drained lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. I put it down to the stress of the… recent changes in my personal life, but perhaps it’s related to this… thirst and hunger? It’s difficult to say, isn't it? Do you have any initial thoughts, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A few possibilities come to mind, Mr. Erxleben, though a conclusive determination requires further investigation. It’s… unlikely to be anything particularly serious, but we must rule out certain conditions. I would like to perform a basic physical examination, and then order some blood work. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, perfectly acceptable. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. A physical examination and blood work sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking the matter seriously. Let's get it done, shall we? The sooner we have an answer, the better. I have a delivery schedule to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I will listen to your heart and lungs first, then palpate your abdomen. Please inform me if you experience any discomfort. Deep breaths, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Deep breaths… yes, deep breaths. Everything feels a bit clinical, doesn’t it? I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, quite some time. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen… slightly tender in the epigastric region. No masses palpated. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140 over 90. And I note you are slightly… overweight. What is your typical diet, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Overweight…? Well, I wouldn’t say overweight, sir, perhaps a bit… robust. My diet… it's fairly typical, I suppose. Breakfast usually consists of toast and a fried egg, sometimes bacon. Lunch is often a sandwich, ham and cheese, or a pasty from the bakery if I’m on a tight schedule. Dinner varies, depending on what my ex-wife—I mean, what my mother—cooks when I visit. Usually something hearty - stew, roast beef, shepherd’s pie. I do enjoy a pint or two with my dinner, if I'm not working late. Not excessively, mind you. Is that… a problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is… not ideal. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. We will also check your HbA1c. These tests will help us rule out several possibilities. I'll have the nurse draw the samples now. Please remain seated and do not consume any food or beverages until after the blood work is completed. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and… HbA1c, was it? I’ll refrain from eating or drinking, as instructed. Though, I must admit, I’m rather parched at the moment. I trust this won’t take too long? I have a rather important delivery to make this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves are relatively quick, Mr. Erxleben. The wait time for the results will depend on the laboratory’s workload. I will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your sugar intake and attempting to reduce your stress levels. The nurse will be with you presently.
PATIENT: .
