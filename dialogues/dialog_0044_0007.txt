DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… painful. That is why I am here. I would like to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner. We’ll get right to it. “Painful” is a bit broad though – could you tell me a little more about where it hurts, and what the pain feels like?
PATIENT: It is in my back. Lower back, mostly. Feels… like something is stuck. And… tight. Very tight. Like a rope pulling. It started a few weeks ago, but it’s gotten worse lately. I work… outside. Building fences. It hurts when I bend over. Or lift things. Even walking sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, starting a few weeks ago, worsening recently. Feels stuck and tight, like a rope pulling. And it’s aggravated by bending, lifting, and walking… that's helpful. To get a better picture, could you rate your pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you’ve ever felt?
PATIENT: Hmm. Zero to ten… that is difficult. When it is just there, not doing anything… maybe a three? When I try to lift a post for the fence… then it’s an eight. Sometimes higher. It takes my breath away. Is that alright? Is eight too high?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Reihner. Eight is a very useful number, and it sounds quite significant. And you're right to tell me it takes your breath away – that's important information. So, it’s a baseline of three, flaring up to eight or higher with exertion like lifting. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Relieves… not much. Laying down helps some. But I can’t just lay down all day. I have work to do. Sometimes… a hot bath. But the feeling comes back quickly. And the medicine the other doctor gave me… did not help. I do not like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, laying down offers some relief, hot baths are temporary, and a previous medication wasn’t effective, and you're not keen on taking pills. I appreciate you telling me that – we’ll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a little bit about your general health. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Maybe fifteen years? And my hip… it aches sometimes, but it’s old. From… falling off a horse when I was younger. Nothing else… I mostly just work. I had a good husband, but he is gone now. Medicare is what I have for insurance. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Reihner. Thank you for sharing that. So, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, some hip pain from a past injury, and Medicare for insurance. And are you currently taking any medications, other than what you’ve already tried for the back pain?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just the one medicine, and it did not work, so I stopped. I take vitamins, sometimes. But that is all. Nothing the doctor prescribed. I don't care for doctors, generally. They don't understand what it is like to… do work. Does that sound rude? I apologize.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Reihner. I completely understand. It’s good to be upfront about those feelings, and it's helpful for me to know. Many people feel that way. Vitamins are fine, we'll note that. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had… trouble with her bones. When she got old. She broke her hip, twice. And her back… it was always bad. She used a cane, for many years. My father was strong. He did not get sick much. That is… all I really know. We did not talk much about it. He was a quiet man. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Reihner. History of bone problems and back pain in your mother is relevant. It sounds like she may have had osteoporosis or some other degenerative condition. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: If it will be quick, then yes. I have to get back to work. I have a fence to finish by Friday. I do not want to waste any time. Please, just be gentle. It hurts to move.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with just a simple exam of your back. Okay, can you tell me if this is tender?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes. Right… there. And… here. It feels… bruised. Even though it is not. That is where it hurts the most. Is that what you were looking for? It is very… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was looking for. Tenderness is common with muscle strains or inflammation. And it’s helpful to know it feels bruised, even if there’s no visible bruising. Now, could you slowly bend forward for me, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ouch! That… hurts. I cannot go any further. It feels like something is… catching. Like a knot. And my leg… it tingles a little now. Is that normal? I do not like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, stop right there. That’s perfectly alright. You don’t need to push it. The tingling in your leg is something we need to pay attention to. It could indicate some nerve involvement. Now, I’m going to gently lift your leg, keeping it straight. Tell me if you feel any pain shooting down your leg.
PATIENT: Ow! Yes. Right there. Down my leg. Like… electricity. It goes all the way to my foot. It makes me want to pull my leg away. Stop, please. That is… not good. It is very… uncomfortable. I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll stop right there. That’s very helpful information. That tingling, radiating pain down your leg – that’s what we call sciatica. It suggests possible compression of a nerve in your lower back. I'm just going to check your reflexes and muscle strength now. Could you let your leg fall loose?
PATIENT: That… felt normal. It is hard to tell. I do not pay much attention to my body. I just work. But it felt… alright. I hope it is not serious. I have a job to finish. And I do not want to take pills.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal on both sides, which is good. And your strength seems to be within normal limits as well, though slightly diminished on the affected side. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you have a lumbar strain with possible nerve involvement – sciatica. It’s likely caused by the physical demands of your work. I wouldn’t say it’s a crisis, but it does require attention. To rule out any more serious causes, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… that is more time wasted. But… if you think it is necessary. Yes. Alright. If it will get me back to work quicker, then yes. But please, no pills. Is there anything else? I have a deadline. I really need to finish that fence. And I do not want to lay in bed for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. The X-ray will help us to see if there are any structural issues. We will avoid medication if we can. I will send you to radiology right away. I want to make a plan to get you back to work safely. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. Gentle stretching and walking are okay, but stop if you feel any pain. I will also prescribe a muscle relaxer to help with the spasms, but it is only for a short time. If it does not work, we will find another option. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxer… that sounds like a pill. But… if it is just for a little while. And if it will help. Alright. I suppose that is better than nothing. I will try it. But if I feel sleepy, I will not be able to work. Avoid lifting… that is hard. My job is lifting. But… I will try. I have to. I need to finish that fence. Is there anything else? I really need to go. Thank you, Doctor. I hope this works.
