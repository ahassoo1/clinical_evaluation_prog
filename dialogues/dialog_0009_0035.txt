DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx, but you can call me Kaelyn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Kaelyn. It’s lovely to meet you too. Oh, goodness, it's these hiccups! They started a few days ago, and they just won’t stop. It’s quite embarrassing, really. Never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I see. Hiccups that have been going on for a few days, and they’re quite persistent. That does sound frustrating, and I understand why you’d be embarrassed. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, they come and go, mostly after I eat, or sometimes just… randomly. Not when I’m nervous, though, which is funny, ‘cause you’d think that would be the time! They're not painful, exactly, just… startling, you know? And they make me jump. I tried holding my breath a few times, like my mother used to tell me, but that hasn’t done a thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a common remedy, but it doesn’t always work. It’s good you’ve already tried something. So, they’re generally not painful, just startling, and they seem to occur more often after you eat, but also randomly at times. You said they haven’t been related to nervousness?
PATIENT: That's right. Not nervousness. Though, I was a bit flustered yesterday at the market, someone bumped into me with their shopping cart, but the hiccups didn’t start ‘til later, after my lunch. I had a lovely tuna sandwich, actually. Maybe it was the tuna? I don't usually eat a lot of tuna.
DOCTOR: It's good you're thinking about what you ate, that's helpful. It's possible something in your lunch triggered it. We'll explore that further. Now, besides the hiccups and the incident at the market, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. No stomach pain, no heartburn, no trouble swallowing... I’ve been sleeping alright, maybe a little restless sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I reckon. Oh! And my appetite is still good, even with the hiccups interrupting everything. I’m still enjoying my meals, just... with extra bursts of air.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – no other associated symptoms like stomach pain, heartburn, or difficulty swallowing. Appetite is good, and you’re sleeping reasonably well despite some restlessness. Now, let’s go over a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be… thirty years now? And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age creeping up on me. I see a specialist for that, gets me some injections now and then. Other than that… nothing major, really. I’ve been quite lucky, all things considered. I used to be a psychiatric aide, you know. Lots of walking back and forth in that job! Keeps you fit, it does.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Gallbladder removal thirty years ago, and arthritis in your knees managed with injections. And you used to work as a psychiatric aide – lots of walking, that’s excellent! Have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don’t believe so. Just the gallbladder, that was back in the eighties. Nothing since then. Oh! Wait a minute... I had a small mole removed from my back a long time ago, but it was just a little thing, local anesthetic, all done in the doctor’s office. That wouldn't count as a surgery, would it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. The mole removal doesn’t really count as a major surgery. So, just the gallbladder removal in the eighties. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… for my arthritis, I get those injections every few months, but I don't take anything regularly. I have some paracetamol at home for aches and pains, but I don't use it often, maybe once or twice a month if my knees are really bothering me. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was a bit low when I had my bloodwork last year. Other than that… that’s it, I think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it years ago, said I didn’t need it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so injections for arthritis, occasional paracetamol for aches and pains, and a vitamin D supplement. You used to take medication for blood pressure, but it was discontinued years ago. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies, no trouble with bee stings or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, really. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Although, I do get a bit itchy sometimes in the spring, but I just put that down to pollen. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – no known allergies. Just some seasonal itchiness, likely due to pollen. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, but I don't recall her having much wrong with her, just the usual aches and pains of old age. My father passed away when I was quite young, heart trouble, I think. And my brother… he had some problems with his blood sugar, but he didn’t take very good care of himself, always smoking and drinking. There was an aunt, on my mother’s side, who had breast cancer, a long time ago. But other than that… not much I can think of. It’s a bit of a scattered memory, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother lived to 92 with general good health, your father passed away from heart trouble, your brother had issues with blood sugar, and an aunt had breast cancer. Finally, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol in… well, decades, I suppose. Not for me, thank you very much. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I used to be very active in the church, you know. Lots of community work, kept me busy. I enjoy a good book and spending time with my grandchildren. That’s my idea of a good time.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. No smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs, and you enjoy a healthy and active lifestyle with church activities and spending time with your grandchildren. That’s excellent. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat.
PATIENT: Alright dear, go right ahead. I don't mind at all. It’s probably just something silly, but it’s good to get it checked out anyway. I always did worry a bit, you know. Just a nervous habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds are good, although your heart rate is a little elevated. Your lungs are clear, and your throat looks perfectly normal. I don't see anything obvious that would explain the hiccups. I’m going to palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Alright dear, go ahead. It doesn't hurt, does it? I've been eating normally, as I said, so I wouldn't think there would be anything wrong there. I do get a bit of gas sometimes, but nothing unusual. It's just old age again, I suppose. Everything feels pretty normal to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I feel some mild fullness, but nothing concerning. No masses or enlarged organs. Your heart rate being a little elevated could be from anxiety about the hiccups, or simply a normal variation. Given the duration of your hiccups and the lack of any obvious findings on the physical exam, I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We'll check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes dear, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, I'm happy to have them done. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. Will I need to come back another day for those tests, or can they do them now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good idea. We can draw the blood samples today, right here in the clinic. It shouldn’t take long. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d like you to keep a food diary. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note when the hiccups occur. This might help us identify any potential triggers. In the meantime, I’ll also prescribe a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you respond. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A food diary and the medication… alright. I can certainly do that. I do like a good list, keeps me organized! And if the hiccups don't go away, what then? Will we need to do more tests, or...? I do worry a bit, you know. It's just... these hiccups are so persistent!
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to worry when something is persistent and unexplained. If the baclofen doesn't help after a week, or if your symptoms worsen, we’ll consider further investigation. This might include a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems, or a referral to a gastroenterologist to assess your esophagus and stomach. However, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Let's start with the blood tests and the medication, and see how you respond. I’m confident we’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and I’ll write you a prescription for the baclofen. Here’s the food diary to get you started. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, dear. Thank you. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to my worries. It’s good to know someone is taking this seriously. Alright, let’s get the blood drawn, then. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your worries. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood now. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions after you’ve started the medication or the food diary. We’ll review the results together in a week, and we’ll go from there.
PATIENT: Alright dear, thank you. I will.
