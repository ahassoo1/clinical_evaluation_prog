DOCTOR: Right. Jaylyne Dhanoa, 27 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It's this ringing in my ears, yeah? It's been bugging me for a bit now. It's not, like, a loud ring, but it's just… always there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Always there, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. It started maybe a month ago, I think? I was working a really busy shift at the restaurant, lots of noise, and I just noticed it after. I thought it would go away, but it hasn't. It's kinda driving me nuts, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A month ago, following a busy shift at the restaurant… So, constant tinnitus, then. And you've noticed it continuously since that shift?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Constant. It's not like it comes and goes, it’s just… there. Sometimes I don’t even notice it until it’s quiet, then it really stands out. Does that make sense? I’m not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Constant tinnitus following noise exposure is...common enough. Are you experiencing any hearing loss along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything seems… normal. I can hear people talking, music, all the usual stuff. But maybe… maybe it's a little harder to hear when it's really noisy, like at work? I hadn't really thought about it, to be honest. I just figured it was the noise itself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Subtly diminished hearing in noisy environments… we'll need to check that. Have you experienced any dizziness, vertigo, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. Vertigo, what's that exactly? Fullness… hmm. Sometimes my ears feel a little blocked, yeah. Like when you’re on a plane, but not as bad. It comes and goes, though. Is that important? I’m sorry, I don’t know all the medical words.
DOCTOR: Vertigo is a spinning sensation. No need to apologize. It’s my job to explain things. Ear fullness is good to know. Let’s move on. Any pain in or around your ears?
PATIENT: No pain at all. Not a single bit. It’s just… this ringing. It's not painful, just annoying. Really annoying. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, especially when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Right. No pain, just the tinnitus. And impacting your sleep. Let’s take a look at your ears, see if we can identify anything obvious. Could you please sit up and lean forward slightly?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Just tell me if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I don’t like things going in my ears, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Just a quick look. Hmm… Okay. Your ear canals appear clear. The tympanic membranes… a little bit of redness, but nothing dramatic. No visible obstructions. I’m going to perform a quick hearing screening now, just to get a baseline. It involves headphones and some beeping sounds. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Beeping sounds? Yeah, okay. Headphones are fine. I hope it doesn't take long. I got another shift starting soon, unfortunately. It’s just… work, you know? Gotta pay the bills.
DOCTOR: Yes, work. I understand. This will only take a few minutes. I’m going to play a series of tones at different frequencies and volumes. Please indicate when you hear a sound – press the button when you do. Try to be as accurate as possible. We’ll start with the right ear.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I'll try. Let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m a bit nervous, sorry. Is this going to tell you what's wrong?
DOCTOR: It will give us a better understanding of the extent, and type, of any hearing loss. Try to remain relaxed. Press the button only when you hear a tone. Alright, switching to the left ear now.
PATIENT: Okay, left ear. Here we go. This is… kinda boring, actually. Not that I’m complaining. Just wondering what you’re looking for. Is it a certain loudness, or a certain… type of beep? Sorry, I’m probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to ask questions. I’m looking for the quietest sounds you can hear at different frequencies. It helps us determine if there's any damage to specific parts of your inner ear. Alright, test complete. The results show mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. This is consistent with noise exposure. The tinnitus is likely related to this.
PATIENT: Mild hearing loss… and the tinnitus is from the noise? So… is there anything I can do about it? Will it go away? I really don't want to have to live with this ringing forever. Especially if it gets worse. Work is already stressful enough.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there’s no cure for tinnitus. However, it can be managed. The hearing loss, even mild, is contributing to the problem. I recommend hearing protection – earplugs or earmuffs – whenever you’re exposed to loud noises at work. We can also explore tinnitus retraining therapy, which helps you habituate to the sound. I'm not convinced it will disappear, but it can become less noticeable. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hearing protection… and therapy? Okay. That sounds… a lot. Is the therapy expensive? And will earplugs really make a difference? It’s so loud at the restaurant, especially during busy periods. I don't wanna spend a bunch of money on something that won’t help. I'm just trying to figure out what my options are. Is there, like, a cheaper way to try and deal with this first?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, it is usually an out-of-pocket expense. As for cheaper options, there are apps that play white noise or masking sounds. Some people find those helpful, though the effectiveness varies. The most important thing is to protect your hearing now to prevent it from getting worse. The tinnitus often becomes more bothersome when the hearing loss progresses. I can write you a referral for an audiologist for a comprehensive evaluation and discuss the various options available. They can also assess your workplace noise levels and recommend appropriate hearing protection. It’s a sensible first step.
PATIENT: Okay, a referral… yeah, that sounds good. That way, I can get someone else’s opinion, too. Just… please make sure they know I really can’t afford a lot. I’m already stretching things thin as it is. And thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it’s not exactly good news. Is there anything else I need to do right now? Or can I just go? I really gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. The referral information is on this slip. Just call to schedule an appointment. I’ll also include some basic information about tinnitus management in your discharge instructions. Try the white noise apps, and most importantly, protect your hearing. If the tinnitus worsens significantly, or you experience any dizziness or hearing loss, contact me immediately. Otherwise, schedule the appointment with the audiologist. And yes, you can go. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. Bye.
