DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm… let me think. It’s my joints, mostly. They get…stuck, you know? Especially in the mornings. It's hard to get going. I don't really… remember when it started, exactly. Just… been happening. It's not awful, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Stuck" is a good way to describe it. And it's worse in the mornings, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, mornings are the worst. Like… when I bend down to pick something up, or get out of a chair. It takes a minute to… loosen up. After I’ve been moving around for a bit, it’s better. But first thing… oof. It’s not painful, not really. Just… stiff. You know? It feels old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, so stiffness that’s worse in the mornings and improves with movement. And you wouldn't describe it as pain, more like… a general stiffness?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Stiffness is… a good word for it. Not pain. And it’s mostly in my… hands and knees, I think. Maybe my shoulders too? Honestly, it all feels a bit… the same sometimes. It’s hard to tell. I used to do a lot of gardening, but… it's been a while. I don’t remember exactly when I stopped. Everything’s a little fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hands, knees, and possibly shoulders are affected. And you used to garden. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I don’t think so? I mean, nothing that I’ve noticed. They don't look… bigger, if that makes sense. I just feel them being… not bendy. Is that a word? Not very bendy. I mostly just try to ignore it and get on with things. It’s just… tiring, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no noticeable swelling. “Not bendy” is perfectly fine as a description. Let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything else, like arthritis or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a good question. I had something… a long time ago. With my heart, I think? Or maybe it was my blood pressure? My husband, George, he always took care of all that. He knew all the doctors' names and what I was supposed to take. Since he… passed, it’s all gotten a bit muddled. I don’t really remember being told anything, if that makes sense. It was just… doctor appointments. He did everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a history of some medical appointments and potentially a heart or blood pressure issue, but you’re not sure of the details. We can look through any old records we might have here at the clinic if you’d like. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That’s all I can remember. And… maybe something with my eyes, years ago? A little thing. But nothing big. Definitely nothing since George… well, since he’s been gone. It's all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child and a small eye procedure. And you’ve mentioned George handled most of your medical care. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any problems with medications in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. I… don't think so. George always made sure I didn't take anything I was allergic to. He was very careful. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. Maybe… a little bit of stomach upset once, but that could have been anything I ate. I really wish George was here, he'd know all this. He had such a good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Alright, Lilliana. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on with your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel a little less… stuck, you know? It's silly, I guess, but it makes everything harder. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your hands for me. Can you squeeze my fingers as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? It feels a little… funny, but I can do it. It’s not painful, just… a bit stiff. I feel it in the knuckles, mostly. Like they’re not wanting to bend.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And on this side?
PATIENT: Same on this side, Doctor. A little stiff, a little funny feeling. That little bump feels a bit harder on this hand, I think. Like a knot. George used to rub those sometimes, with lotion. He said it was just… old age. He was always very practical.
DOCTOR: Alright, now let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend your knees for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: There. That's about as far as I can go without it feeling… tight. It’s a little creaky, you know? Like old hinges. Not really painful, but… I can feel it. Mostly on the inside of the knee. And it's a bit harder to get up after I bend them. Like I need a little boost.
DOCTOR: Okay, and your shoulders...can you raise your arms up for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: There. That's… about as high as I can go without it feeling… uncomfortable. A little stiff, you know? And it feels… tight, across the top of the shoulder. Like a knot. I used to be able to reach up and clean the high shelves, but… not anymore. It just doesn’t go up as high as it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilliana. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing osteoarthritis, or wear-and-tear arthritis, in your hands, knees, and potentially your shoulders. The stiffness, especially in the mornings, the crepitus, and the limited range of motion are all consistent with that. The bumps on your knuckles are also common in osteoarthritis. It’s a very common condition, especially as we get older.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Arthritis. That sounds… serious. George never said anything about arthritis. Is it… bad? Will I be stuck like this forever? I just want to be able to move around without feeling like an old… rusty gate. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “serious” in the sense of being life-threatening, Lilliana. It’s a chronic condition, which means it’s long-term. And while there isn’t a cure, there are definitely things we can do to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. It sounds like it’s impacting your ability to do things you enjoy, and we want to address that. It doesn't mean you’ll be stuck like this forever, but it will require ongoing management. The goal is to reduce the stiffness and pain, and help you maintain your independence. We can start with some simple things, like gentle exercise, weight management, and over-the-counter pain relievers. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… good, Doctor. Anything to feel a little less stuck. Gentle exercise sounds… okay. I used to enjoy walking, but I haven't done much of that lately. And weight management… well, I do like my baking, but… I suppose I could try. Over-the-counter pain relievers… George used to give me something for my aches and pains. What kind of pain relievers are we talking about? And… will I need to see someone special? A physical therapist, maybe? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can start with over-the-counter options like acetaminophen – that’s Tylenol – or ibuprofen – that’s Advil or Motrin. Both can help with the pain and stiffness. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. As for seeing someone special, a physical therapist would be very beneficial. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles around the joints, improve your range of motion, and reduce the stiffness. I can give you a referral. It's not a bother at all, Lilliana. We want to get you the help you need. I’m also going to recommend some gentle stretching exercises you can do at home. I'll print out a handout for you. Do you have any concerns about starting these things?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… manageable. Acetaminophen… I think George used to give me that sometimes. And a physical therapist… that sounds helpful. I just hope it doesn’t… hurt too much. I’m a bit worried about making things worse. And the stretching… I’m not very flexible, to be honest. But I’m willing to try. Will the handout have pictures? I’m a bit of a visual learner. And… how often should I do the stretches? I don't want to overdo it.
DOCTOR: The handout does have pictures, Lilliana, so that will be helpful. And the physical therapist will tailor the exercises to your specific needs and abilities, so you won’t be doing anything that’s too painful or difficult. We start slow and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. For the stretches, we’ll start with doing them once or twice a day, holding each stretch for about 30 seconds. If you feel any sharp pain, stop immediately. Mild discomfort is okay, but we want to avoid anything that’s truly painful. We’ll also discuss some strategies for protecting your joints, like using assistive devices if needed, and avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms. I’m going to write a referral for physical therapy now, and I'll also print out that handout for you. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think… that makes sense, Doctor. Pictures are good. And starting slow is a good idea. I just… I want to be able to do things again. Even just… gardening. That would be nice. And… thank you. You’ve been very patient with me. I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I understand it can be frustrating to forget things. We'll take things one step at a time. And yes, let's aim to get you back to gardening, if that's what you'd like. I'm hopeful that with some consistent effort, we can improve your quality of life. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help.
