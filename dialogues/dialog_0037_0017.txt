DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. AX. It’s August 2nd, 2025. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well… a physical. For… the tryouts. I think. Some team. A baseball team, maybe? It’s all a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. They said I needed a check-up first. You know, to make sure I'm… still able. It’s important to be able, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A pre-participation physical, good thinking. Important to get everything checked out before starting any new activity, especially when it comes to sports. “Still able” is definitely the right way to put it. Okay, let’s start with some basics. You mentioned baseball tryouts. Have you played baseball regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. That’s a good question. I… used to. When I was younger, of course. A long time ago. Not… professionally, no. Just… with friends. In the neighborhood. It was… a lot of years back. I wouldn’t say “regularly” now. Not like then. Things change, you see. My knees aren’t what they used to be, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, some previous participation, but not currently active. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned your knees. Are you experiencing any specific issues with them right now?
PATIENT: Well, they ache. They always ache, especially when it's… humid, like today. And going up stairs is… not a joy. It’s a little… creaky. Not a sharp pain, just… old. They get stiff, you know? Like they need oiling. I take… something for it sometimes. A little white pill. But honestly, I forget what it’s called. My ex-wife used to handle all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some chronic knee pain, worse with humidity and stair climbing. And you’re currently taking something for it, but you’re unsure of the name. That's alright, we can try to figure that out later. Do you remember approximately when this knee pain started, or was it a gradual onset?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It wasn’t a… pop, or anything. Just… slowly getting worse over time. A long time. Years, definitely. Maybe… after the divorce? No, that was… a lot to deal with. I don't remember exactly when my knees started bothering me. It all sort of… blurred together after that. It’s just… old age, I suppose. It happens to everyone, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Bartok. And sometimes it's hard to pinpoint exactly when things started. Let's move on to other areas. Besides your knees, are you experiencing any pain in other joints – hips, shoulders, wrists, ankles?
PATIENT: Hmm. My shoulders get a little… tight sometimes. When I'm… doing something with my arms. Lifting things, mostly. Not a pain, exactly. Just… stiff. Like they need stretching. And my wrists… I don’t really do much with my wrists. So, no. Nothing much there. The knees are the main problem. And maybe a little stiffness in the shoulders. Nothing to write home about, really. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some intermittent shoulder stiffness with activity. We'll make a note of that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, I think. The doctor mentioned something about that… a while back. I used to take a pill for it. A little red one. But I stopped taking it. Didn’t like the way it made me feel. And… arthritis, maybe? My mother had that. In her hands. I might have some… a little bit. But honestly, I don’t really pay attention to those things. Doctors always talking about something. It’s all a blur. My ex-wife kept track of all that. She was good with details.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of hypertension and a family history of arthritis. We’ll need to confirm those. Do you happen to know when you were diagnosed with high blood pressure, or what medication you were taking for it?
PATIENT: No, sir. I really don't. It was… a long time ago. Before the divorce, probably. The doctor just… wrote me a prescription. I took it for a while, then stopped. It made me feel… tired. And dizzy. And honestly, I don’t remember the name of the pill. They all look the same, you know? Little colored things. My ex-wife, she always knew. She kept everything organized. It’s a shame, really. She was very… efficient. I just can’t recall the details. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. It's common for details to get lost over time, especially with past medical history. We’ll do our best to piece things together. Let's switch gears slightly. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Love a good pastrami on rye. Never had a reaction to anything. Not a rash, not a cough, not a… anything. Maybe… dust? I sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes, right? No, no allergies. Definitely not. My ex-wife would have told me if I had any allergies. She was very careful about those things. She always read the labels. I just… don’t worry about it. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well… I mentioned the white pill for my knees. But I don't remember what it’s called. And… sometimes I take something for sleep. When I can’t get to sleep. Just a little one. A blue one, I think. But not every night. Only when I’m really restless. And… that’s it. I think. Maybe? Honestly, I don't really keep track. My ex-wife… she managed all that. She was very organized. I just… take what I need when I need it. It's all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for knee pain , and a blue pill for sleep . We will try to get more information on those. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? What does that mean, exactly? Do you mean… friends? I have a few. Old friends. We don’t see each other much anymore. Mostly just… wave when we see each other around the neighborhood. I used to… go to the bar sometimes. But not anymore. It wasn't really my scene. And… I’m divorced, as I mentioned. No children. Just… me. I mostly keep to myself these days. It’s… peaceful that way. Is that what you mean? Social history?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean. It helps me understand your lifestyle and habits. You’ve given me a good overview. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. My ex-wife… she hated smoking. She always said it was bad for you. And she was right, I suppose. Never appealed to me anyway. I like a good cigar sometimes, with a friend. But that’s it. Very rarely. Just… to celebrate. But I don't smoke regularly. No. Not a smoker. Never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular smoking. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes. A cold one. But not anymore. Doesn't really agree with me these days. Gives me indigestion. And… it reminds me of things. Bad things. So, no. I don't really drink anymore. Maybe a glass of wine on a special occasion. But that's it. Very rarely. Just… to celebrate. But I don’t drink regularly. Not at all. My ex-wife… she preferred tea. Much healthier, she always said.
DOCTOR: Okay, minimal alcohol consumption. That’s helpful to know. And finally, can you tell me about your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Diet… well, I like to eat. Pastrami on rye is a favorite, as I mentioned. And a good steak now and then. My ex-wife… she tried to get me to eat more vegetables. But I’m not a big fan. I eat what I like, mostly. And exercise…? I walk sometimes. To the store. And back. It's not much, but it's something. I used to play baseball, of course. But that was a long time ago. These knees… they don't allow for much exercise anymore. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. It's hard to stay active when things start to ache, you know? My ex-wife… she was very active. She went to the gym every day. I just… prefer a quiet evening at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Let’s move on to the physical exam. We'll start with your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my knees. They're a bit sensitive, you know? And… if you could explain things as you go, that would be appreciated. I don't really understand all the medical terms. My ex-wife… she always explained everything. Very clearly. But… she’s not here, so… yes. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. I will explain everything as we go, and I'll be as gentle as possible with your knees. Let’s start with your height and weight. Okay, you’re 5’8” and 124 pounds. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. This won’t hurt, but let me know if it's uncomfortable. Your reflexes are normal. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I am. Careful with the hammer, Doctor. They’re a bit… tender. And… what are you looking for exactly? Is something wrong? My ex-wife… she always told me what was going on. Very clearly. But… I don’t want to bother you if it’s nothing. Just tell me straight. If something’s broken, just tell me. I can handle it. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just feeling around your knees to see if there’s any swelling or tenderness. I see some mild swelling on both sides, and it’s a little tender when I press here and here. Now, can you bend your knees for me, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ouch. That’s about as far as they’ll go. They creak a lot, you know? Like old hinges. And… it’s a little painful. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like they’re rubbing together. My ex-wife… she always said I needed to stretch more. But I never got around to it. It's hard to stay motivated, you know? And… it’s getting harder every year. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? Are you going to have to… fix them? I don't want surgery, if you can avoid it. My ex-wife… she had a bad experience with surgery. Very bad.
DOCTOR: I see. Your range of motion is limited, and I can feel some creaking when you bend your knees. This is consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common condition that causes the cartilage in your joints to break down over time. It's the cause of the swelling and discomfort you're experiencing. Now, let me assure you, surgery is not necessarily the first option. In many cases, osteoarthritis can be managed with non-surgical treatments like physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. We’ll discuss those options in detail shortly. Now, let's just quickly check your other joints to make sure there isn’t any similar discomfort elsewhere. Just to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Alright. Non-surgical… that’s good. I prefer that. My ex-wife… she always said to avoid surgery if possible. Very wise woman. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. My shoulders get a little stiff sometimes, as I mentioned. But nothing serious. Just… old age, I suppose. And… please be gentle. I’m a bit sensitive, you know? And… explain everything as you go. I don’t want any surprises. My ex-wife… she always made sure I understood. Very clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling around your shoulders now. I do notice some mild tenderness when I press here and here, and your range of motion is a little limited. It sounds like you have some mild stiffness in your shoulder joints as well. Okay, Mr. Bartok, that completes the physical exam. Based on my findings, it appears you have osteoarthritis in both your knees and mild stiffness in your shoulders. Now, let’s talk about the next steps. We can order some X-rays to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the arthritis. We can also discuss treatment options, including physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: X-rays… that sounds… serious. Is it bad? Are my knees… broken? My ex-wife… she always said to get a second opinion. Very cautious woman. Physical therapy… that sounds… tiring. And pain medication… I don’t like taking pills. But… I suppose if it helps… What kind of pills are we talking about? And… lifestyle modifications…? What does that mean exactly? Do I have to… change my diet? My ex-wife… she was always trying to get me to eat more vegetables. Very persistent woman. Just… tell me straight, Doctor. What am I looking at here? Is it going to get worse? Am I going to be able to… play baseball? That’s why I came here, you know. I want to try out for the team. I need to know if it’s even possible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, let’s take things one step at a time. The X-rays are simply to get a clearer picture of what’s going on inside your knees, to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the arthritis. They’re not a sign that anything is immediately broken. As for the arthritis itself, it’s a progressive condition, meaning it can get worse over time if left untreated. However, with proper management, we can slow down the progression and manage your symptoms effectively. Physical therapy will help strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. It can be challenging, but it's a very effective way to manage your symptoms. As for pain medication, we can start with over-the-counter options like ibuprofen or naproxen, and if those aren’t enough, we can consider stronger medications. Now, as for playing baseball… it depends on the severity of your arthritis and how well you respond to treatment. We need to get the X-rays done and develop a treatment plan first. We can also consult with a physical therapist who specializes in sports medicine to see if it’s even feasible. It may require modifications to your training regimen or limitations on your activity level. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help you achieve your goals. But we need to be realistic and take things one step at a time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: One step at a time… that sounds… reasonable. My ex-wife… she always said to be practical. Very sensible woman. X-rays first… then physical therapy… and maybe… baseball? It’s a long shot, I suppose. But… I want to try. I need to try. Alright, Doctor. Let’s do the X-rays. And… if you could explain everything as you go… that would be appreciated. And… please be gentle. My ex-wife… she always made sure I understood. Very kind woman. When can we do them? And… what do I have to do? Just tell me straight. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I just want to play baseball.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I understand. We'll take it one step at a time. The X-rays are very simple and painless. You’ll just lie on a table, and a technician will take pictures of your knees. It takes about 15-20 minutes. You don’t need to do anything special beforehand. I’ll write an order for the X-rays, and then you can go to the radiology department. They’ll schedule an appointment for you. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and develop a treatment plan. I will explain everything as we go, and I’ll make sure you understand all your options. And I’ll be as gentle as possible with your knees. Here is the order for the X-rays. The radiology department is located on the second floor, just down the hallway. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Second floor… down the hallway… alright. No, I think that’s all. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… one more thing. Do you think… do you really think I can still play baseball? Even if it’s just… a little bit? My ex-wife… she always believed in me. Very supportive woman. That’s why I’m here. I need to know if there’s still a chance. Just… be honest with me, Doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, it's difficult to say definitively right now. It depends on the severity of the arthritis and how well you respond to treatment. But I wouldn't dismiss the possibility entirely. We need to manage your symptoms, strengthen the muscles around your knees, and improve your range of motion. If we can do that, there’s a chance you can still participate in some level of baseball activity. It may require modifications to your training regimen or limitations on your playing time, but it's not out of the question. I want to be realistic, but I also want to be optimistic. Let's get the X-rays done and see what they show. Then we can develop a treatment plan and see how you respond. I will work with you every step of the way. And I want to support your goal of playing baseball, if it's feasible. Now, go ahead and get the X-rays done. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll discuss the results together and see what our options are. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That’s… that’s good enough for now. Thank you. No, I think that’s all. I appreciate your honesty and… your support. My ex-wife… she would have liked you very much. Very discerning woman. I’ll go get the X-rays done. And I’ll call if I have any questions. Thank you again, Doctor. I hope… I hope you’re right.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Bartok. I hope everything goes well. Hopefully, we can help him achieve his goals. .
