DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been getting… harder, I suppose. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s just… uncomfortable. I don’t… I don’t really know why it’s happening. It’s been… a while since I’ve felt quite right.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Harder breathing” and dryness in your mouth and eyes… that certainly sounds uncomfortable. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like… a sudden thing. It’s come on slowly, over… months, I think. It’s worse when I… when I’m doing things. Like walking, or… trying to concentrate on my writing. It feels like I just can't get enough air, sometimes. But even when I'm resting, it’s… there. A little bit. It’s hard to explain. Do you… understand? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. You’re explaining it very well. The gradual onset you describe, and the worsening with exertion, is helpful information. It sounds like you're experiencing some degree of dyspnea – difficulty breathing – and that it's impacting your daily activities. To get a clearer picture, could you rate your breathlessness on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no difficulty breathing at all, and 10 being the worst difficulty you can imagine?
PATIENT: Oh… a scale? Um… well, when I’m just sitting, like now, it’s… maybe a 2 or 3? It’s not… terrible. But when I try to do something, like walk up the stairs, or… even just focus on my work for a long time… it goes up. Maybe a 6 or 7 then? It makes me… feel anxious, which makes it worse, I think. It’s hard to say, exactly. I don’t… I don’t often think in numbers. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Kobler. A 2-3 at rest and increasing to 6-7 with exertion gives us a good baseline. The fact that it’s exacerbated by anxiety is also important. Now, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms accompanying the breathlessness and dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… well, I’ve been… very tired lately. More tired than usual, even after sleeping. And… my appetite hasn’t been very good. I’ve lost a little weight, I think, but I haven’t really been keeping track. Oh! And sometimes… my heart feels like it’s racing, even when I’m not doing anything. Does that… count? I haven't noticed anything else, really. I’m trying to remember… but my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kobler. Fatigue, decreased appetite with some weight loss, and palpitations—a racing heart—are all relevant symptoms. You mentioned your memory isn’t what it used to be – has that been a recent change, or something that’s developed over time as well?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that’s a good question. It’s been… gradual, I think. Like everything else. It’s not like I suddenly forgot how to do things, but I… misplace things more often. And sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. It’s been… worrying me, a little. I just… assumed it was getting older. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing this up, Ms. Kobler. Gradual changes in memory, alongside the other symptoms you’ve described, are worth investigating further. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you please tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh… my medical history. Um… well, I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Honestly. I try to avoid it, if I can. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. And… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. But that was… decades ago. I don't… I don't really have any major medical problems, that I know of. I had a… a divorce a few years ago, but that wasn't a medical thing. Is that… helpful? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. No need to apologize. Knowing you haven't had significant medical issues in the past is helpful. And a history of tonsillectomy is noted. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: No… no other surgeries. Just my tonsils. I… I’ve never really been one for hospitals, or doctors, if I can help it. I prefer to… take care of myself, if possible. It’s just… been a long time since I needed to see a doctor, so I haven’t. I hope that’s… okay. I'm starting to feel a little anxious again, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly okay, Ms. Kobler. I understand your reluctance, and I appreciate you being honest with me. It’s good you came in today. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – for example, heart disease, lung problems, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s… difficult. My mother… she had… problems with her heart, I think. She died when I was young, so I don’t… I don’t really remember much about it. My father… he was… a fisherman. He was very healthy, as far as I know. He lived a long life. But he… he didn’t really talk about his health. And I… I didn’t have a very close relationship with either of them, if I’m honest. So I don’t… I don’t really know much about their medical history. I’m sorry. Is that… enough?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. Knowing your mother had heart problems is helpful, even if the details are limited. And it's understandable that you don’t have a full picture of your father’s health history. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… I’ve never been interested in smoking. My father smoked, though. A lot. He… he quit before he died, thankfully. But… it was hard on him. I always thought it was a terrible habit. No, I don’t smoke. And I don’t… I don’t drink very much alcohol, either. Occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kobler. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Um… I don’t think I have any allergies. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything, that I know of. I’ve… I’ve never really paid much attention, to be honest. I’ve never had to. No… I don’t think I have any allergies. But I’m not… completely sure. I’m sorry. Is that… okay? I tend to forget things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. It’s good to know you haven't experienced any allergic reactions. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No… no medications. Not at all. I… I try to avoid them, if possible. I prefer to… take care of myself naturally. I don't… I don't like the idea of putting things into my body that I don’t need. No, I'm not taking any medications. Nothing at all. I hope that's… helpful. I’m starting to feel a little tired again. And my mouth… it feels very dry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kobler. That completes our initial history taking. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. If you think it’s necessary. I… I’m not very fond of examinations, but… I trust your judgment. If it will help me figure out what’s wrong, then… yes, please. Just… please be gentle? I tend to… get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kobler. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen saturation. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths in and out as I listen.
PATIENT: Okay… deep breaths. I can do that. I… I hope it’s not anything serious. It feels… strange, having someone listen to my chest. I… I’m trying to breathe deeply, but it’s a little difficult. It feels… like there’s something… blocking my air. Is that normal? I'm starting to feel anxious again.
DOCTOR: I hear some mild wheezing in your lungs, Ms. Kobler, particularly on exhale. Your heart sounds regular, but slightly rapid. This wheezing could indicate some narrowing of your airways. I also notice you are using some accessory muscles – muscles in your neck and chest – to breathe, which suggests you are working harder to get enough air. Now, I'm going to check your ears, nose, and throat. Please open your mouth and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Ah… It feels… dry in there, doesn’t it? I’ve been drinking a lot of water, but it doesn’t seem to help. And my eyes… they feel like sand. I… I don’t know what’s going on. Is it… serious, Doctor? It feels… worse than it did this morning. I’m starting to feel… a little scared.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a little red, but there are no signs of a sore throat or infection. Your ears and nose look normal. Based on the physical exam and your history, I'm hearing some mild wheezing and noticing you’re working harder to breathe, along with the dryness in your mouth and throat, fatigue, and palpitations. Given your history of gradual onset and worsening symptoms, several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to asthma, allergies, or possibly even an underlying cardiac issue contributing to the fatigue and palpitations. The dryness could be related to medication side effects, dehydration, or a separate underlying issue. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. I also recommend a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs more closely. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a chest X-ray? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it… is it something I should be very worried about? I… I don’t like hospitals, and I don’t like tests. But… if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then… yes, I suppose so. But… will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I… I just want to know what’s going on, and I want to feel better. I'm starting to feel a little lightheaded.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Kobler. It’s natural to feel worried when facing medical tests. The blood work is a simple procedure, involving a small needle prick in your arm. There will be some momentary discomfort, but it's generally well-tolerated. The chest X-ray is also non-invasive and doesn’t involve any pain. You’ll simply stand or sit in front of a machine while a picture is taken of your lungs. The results will typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, resting as much as possible, and avoiding any strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Would you like me to write you a prescription for an inhaler in the meantime to help with the wheezing?
PATIENT: An inhaler… Yes… yes, that would be good. If it will help me breathe easier. I… I’m starting to feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something. Thank you, Doctor. So… blood work, a chest X-ray, and an inhaler. And then we wait for the results. Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything I should be worried about? I… I just want to get this sorted out, and I want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. Yes, you’ve summarized it perfectly – blood work, a chest X-ray, and an inhaler. I'm going to prescribe you a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler, such as albuterol. It will help to open up your airways and relieve any wheezing or shortness of breath. I also want to emphasize that while we're exploring these possibilities, it's important to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I'll be sure to discuss this with you in detail once we have the blood work and chest X-ray results. Here’s the prescription. You can take it to any pharmacy. I’ll also have the nurse schedule the blood work and chest X-ray for you. Finally, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I appreciate your help. And… thank you for listening to me. I just want to feel better. I… I hope the tests don’t show anything too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I understand your concerns, and I hope the tests provide us with some answers. Please remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule your tests and answer any remaining questions you may have. Have a good day, Ms. Kobler, and please take care of yourself.
