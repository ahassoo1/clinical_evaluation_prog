DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, numbness in my leg. It’s been ongoing for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It primarily affects my left leg, starting in my foot and sometimes extending up to just below the knee. It doesn’t feel like pain, exactly. More… a lack of sensation. Like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn’t go away quickly. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening with increasing frequency over the past few weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's in your left leg, starting in the foot, sometimes up to below the knee. No pain, just a lack of sensation, like it falling asleep, and it’s been happening more often recently. Does anything specific seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I’ve noticed it tends to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long period, particularly if I’m working. I do special effects and animation, and that often involves being on my feet for hours at a time while setting up shots or adjusting equipment. Also, I’ve noticed it’s a bit more pronounced after a long day of walking. I was hiking last weekend, and it was fairly noticeable by the end of the trail. I haven’t been able to pinpoint anything else, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with prolonged standing or walking. Special effects and animation…that makes sense. And hiking definitely adds to it. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg at all?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s a tricky one. I wouldn’t say significant weakness, no. But sometimes, after it’s been numb for a while, my leg feels a little… less responsive, perhaps? It's hard to explain. Like it takes a little more effort to lift it, or to balance on it. It’s not a crippling weakness, and it doesn’t happen every time, but I’ve noticed it a few times. I wouldn’t want to overstate it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some feeling of reduced responsiveness, maybe a little more effort to lift or balance sometimes, but not consistent or severe. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel or bladder function? No, Doctor, I haven’t. Everything seems to be functioning normally in that regard. I hadn’t considered that being relevant, to be honest. Is that something that could be connected?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t noticed any changes. It's just something we check for to rule out certain possibilities. Okay. And have you had any recent injuries to your leg, back, or hip?
PATIENT: No injuries, not recently. I might have twisted my ankle a bit when I was younger, playing basketball, but that was years ago, and it healed completely. I’ve had no falls or any kind of trauma to my leg, back, or hip in the last year, at least. I’m fairly careful when I’m working, given the equipment involved, and I try to be mindful of my movements during hikes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent injuries. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I don’t have any chronic conditions like diabetes, arthritis, or anything of that nature. I have private insurance, and I’ve had regular check-ups over the years, and nothing significant has ever come up on those. I can provide you with my medical records if that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major medical history, regular check-ups with no issues. We can access your records electronically here, so no need to worry about bringing them in right now. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I generally try to avoid taking medications unless absolutely necessary. I might take ibuprofen occasionally for a headache, but that’s about it. And I don’t take any supplements, vitamins, or anything of that nature. I try to maintain a healthy diet and get enough rest, and that usually keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medications, and I don’t have any food allergies. I’ve eaten just about everything, and I’ve never experienced any issues. My family doesn’t have a strong history of allergies either, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My maternal grandmother had arthritis, and my father's father had some heart problems later in life, but beyond that, not really. My mother is very healthy, and my siblings are as well. No history of diabetes, neurological disorders, or anything like that that I'm aware of. My family is fairly small, so there isn’t a huge amount of medical history to draw on, to be honest. Would it be helpful if I were to ask my mother about any other potential issues?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your grandmother, heart problems in your grandfather. No major neurological issues or diabetes. That’s helpful. And no, it’s not necessary to ask your mother right now, unless something specific comes to mind. Now, just a quick question about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a month, but I don’t drink regularly. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I generally prefer to stay active and healthy, and those things wouldn't align with that lifestyle. I spend a lot of time outdoors, hiking and exploring, and I value my physical well-being.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine, no recreational drugs. That's good. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to do or any position you'd prefer. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that sufficient? I can try harder if you need me to. I haven’t been doing any heavy lifting recently, so I may not be at my strongest.
DOCTOR: Okay, strength is 5/5 in both legs, also normal. Now, I’m going to check sensation. Close your eyes. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… now. I feel it now. Is that what you were looking for? Everything feels… normal to me, but I'm happy to answer whatever questions you have. It’s just a little difficult to pinpoint the exact sensation given the numbness I’ve been experiencing.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is slightly diminished to light touch in the lateral aspect of your left foot and ankle, compared to the right. Everything else feels intact. Palpation of your lower back and legs is normal; no tenderness or muscle spasm. Your pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Overall, the exam is fairly normal, but the slightly diminished sensation on the left foot is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: That's… interesting. I hadn't noticed that difference in sensation myself, but that makes sense given what I've been experiencing. So, what does that indicate, Doctor? What would be the next step in figuring out the cause of this numbness? I’m happy to do whatever tests or scans you recommend.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect this could be related to a nerve compression somewhere along the leg or lower back. It could be something relatively minor like sciatica, or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an MRI of your lower lumbar spine. This will help us visualize the nerves and identify any potential compression. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds reasonable. Yes, that would be perfectly alright with me. I trust your professional judgment, Doctor. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the scan? And how long will it typically take to get the results back? I’m happy to schedule the appointment at your earliest convenience.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. For the MRI, you don't need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. Just let the technician know if you have any metal implants. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes for the scan itself. The radiologist will then review the images, and it usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back to me. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that significantly worsen your symptoms. Is there anything specific that seems to aggravate it?
PATIENT: That’s good to know. No metal implants. And avoiding activities that worsen it… Yes, prolonged standing, particularly while working, definitely seems to make it worse. Hiking, too, as I mentioned before. I can certainly adjust my schedule to minimize those activities while we wait for the results. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any over-the-counter remedies you’d recommend for temporary relief? Perhaps a specific type of stretching or exercise?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Avoid prolonged standing and hiking as much as possible. For temporary relief, you can try over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen as directed on the label. And gentle stretching can be helpful, but avoid anything that causes pain. Try some simple calf stretches and hamstring stretches. I'm also going to give you a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you some specific exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles, which can help support your spine and alleviate nerve compression. Would you like me to give you that information now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A referral to a physical therapist sounds like a good idea. I’m happy to do whatever I can to address this issue. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I feel much more informed and confident in our plan of action. Please, provide me with the information for the physical therapist, and I’ll schedule an appointment as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Here's the referral slip. I recommend calling them and scheduling an initial evaluation. They'll be able to assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. To recap: we’re ordering an MRI of your lower lumbar spine, I've given you a referral to physical therapy, and I recommend avoiding activities that worsen your symptoms and taking ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and thorough explanation. I feel much better equipped to manage this situation now. I’ll be sure to follow up as soon as I have the MRI results and will schedule an appointment with the physical therapist. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You’re very welcome. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Tarin.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor Amussen. Thank you again for everything. .
