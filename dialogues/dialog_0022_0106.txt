DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Though I must say, you don't look like a doctor. Too young, if you ask me. But never you mind that. I’m here because of this foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it won't heal. I’ve tried everything. Everything, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Louine. Age doesn't necessarily determine someone's ability to help, and I assure you I'm fully qualified to assist you. We'll get to the bottom of this foot soreness. Can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m sure you are. Still... it's unsettling. Anyway. It started as a little cut, I think. Probably from my sandals. I wear sandals all the time, you know. Comfortable. But then it just... got worse. Red, swollen, and now it’s this awful hole. It weeps, Doctor. Weeps. And it’s painful when I walk. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I’ve also noticed my legs feel…tingly sometimes. Do you know what that means?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cut that worsened, redness, swelling, weeping, and pain with walking. And tingling in your legs. That gives me a little more to work with. When you say “weeks,” roughly how many weeks has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It must be… seven weeks, maybe eight. Started right after my grandson, Keoni, came to visit from Majuro. He’s a good boy, but always tracking sand in. I remember because he brought me those lovely plumeria blossoms. Right around then. Seven, eight weeks. Perhaps longer. Time does fly when you're older, you know. It’s definitely been a while. Long enough to be very, very bothersome. And getting worse, steadily.
DOCTOR: I understand. Seven or eight weeks of a worsening sore. That is a long time. And it's good you remember details like that, it helps me understand the timeline. You mentioned keeping it clean. Could you describe how you've been cleaning it?
PATIENT: Well, I wash it with soap and water. Simple, really. Just like my mother taught me. And then I put a bandage on it. A clean one, of course. I change it every day, sometimes twice a day if it gets particularly… damp. I use those little adhesive bandages, the kind everyone uses. Nothing fancy. I also tried some of that ointment Keoni brought. Some kind of healing balm, he said. Didn’t seem to do much good, just made it sticky. Honestly, I don’t know what else to do. I’ve always been able to take care of myself. This is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, soap and water, daily bandage changes, and a healing balm from your grandson. It sounds like you've been doing your best to manage it yourself, Louine. Now, let's take a look at the foot itself. Would you mind if I examined it?
PATIENT: Oh, go right ahead, Doctor. Honestly, it's not a pretty sight. But don't expect miracles. I told you, it’s been through a lot. And I've got very sensitive skin, always have. Careful now, don’t poke too hard. I will tell you if it hurts. I’m not one to mince words. Though I suppose a doctor should be used to dealing with… complaints.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Louine. I appreciate your patience. Hmm. I see some redness and swelling extending beyond the immediate wound. The sore itself does appear quite deep, and there's some discoloration of the surrounding tissue. And yes, that is tender. It appears we may have a bit more than a simple cut here, Louine. It looks like there could be an infection present. Do you have a fever, or have you noticed any chills or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: An infection, you say? Oh dear. Well, no fever, not that I've noticed. I do get a bit warm sometimes, but that's just the weather. It’s been terribly humid lately. And no chills, or night sweats. Though I do sleep with a fan on. Always have. Can’t sleep without a good breeze. But no, nothing like a fever or chills. I haven't been feeling sick, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And increasingly worried, now that you mention an infection. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Don't tell me I need an amputation! I've seen things… terrible things.
DOCTOR: No, no amputation is needed, Louine. Please don’t worry. I just want to be thorough. It's good you haven't had fever or chills, that's a positive sign. An infection simply means bacteria have entered the wound. It's quite common with sores, especially if they're taking a long time to heal. We can usually treat it with antibiotics. To be certain, I'd like to send a sample of the wound to the lab for a culture. That will tell us exactly what type of bacteria we're dealing with and which antibiotic will be most effective. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A culture, you say? Well, alright, I suppose. If you think it's necessary. Though I don’t like the sound of it. Is it painful? Will it leave a scar? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had enough of things leaving scars. And what about these antibiotics? Will they make me feel sick? I don't have a strong stomach, you know. And I have to take my medication for my… well, never you mind what I take. But it doesn’t mix well with everything. Honestly, it’s a whole ordeal. I just want this foot to get better, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Louine. The culture itself is a very quick procedure. We'll gently swab the wound to collect a small sample. It shouldn’t be painful, maybe a little bit of pressure. And it shouldn't leave a noticeable scar. As for the antibiotics, some people experience mild side effects like nausea or stomach upset, but we can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. We'll also carefully review your medications to make sure there are no interactions. I’ll need to know everything you're taking to ensure your safety. Could you please tell me all the medications you currently take, including any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? Let me think… There’s the… the little blue pill for my blood pressure. My doctor in Honolulu prescribed that. And then there’s the white one, for my… well, my joints. They ache terribly, you know. Especially in the mornings. And then there's the one for my… my heart. It flutters sometimes. It’s a very small pill, pinkish. And then I take… Oh dear. This is terrible. I have a whole bottle of vitamins. Fish oil, Vitamin D… something for my eyes, I think. My grandson, Keoni, keeps giving me things. He means well, but I can barely keep track. And then… and then there's that herbal tea my niece sends from Guam. It's supposed to be good for everything. Honestly, it’s a mess. Do you want me to get my list? It's somewhere in my purse…
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Louine. Take your time. Finding the list is the most important thing. I’m happy to wait. It’s much better to be thorough and ensure we have an accurate picture of everything you’re taking. Don't worry about rushing. We'll get through this together. While you’re looking, I’ll just make a few more notes on your chart.
PATIENT: Oh dear, this is a disaster! I swear, this purse is a black hole. Where did I even put the list? I thought I had it organized… Keoni keeps telling me to get a smaller purse. But I need to carry everything! You never know when you’ll need something. Wait… here it is! Finally. It's a bit smudged, but you should be able to read it. It's mostly the names of the pills, I think. And the dosages… I hope I wrote them down correctly. Here you go. Be careful, it’s a bit fragile. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a mess. But I'm trying. I really am. I just want to be able to walk comfortably again. That's all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Louine. This is perfect. It may be a bit smudged, but it gives me a very good starting point. And please don't apologize for being a "mess." Life happens, and keeping track of everything can be challenging. Alright, let's see… Lisinopril for blood pressure, good. Meloxicam for joints, okay. Digoxin for heart… excellent. And a variety of vitamins including fish oil and Vitamin D. This is helpful. Now, based on what you’ve told me and my examination, I suspect you have an infected sore on your foot. The redness, swelling, pain, and the fact that it hasn't healed in seven or eight weeks all point to that. We need to address the infection to allow it to heal. I'm going to order a culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. I'll also prescribe a course of oral antibiotics, starting with a low dose to minimize any potential side effects. We'll monitor your progress closely, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess the wound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. As sensible as anything can be, given the circumstances. Antibiotics, a culture… and a follow-up appointment. Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I just hope it doesn't make me feel terrible. I get so nauseous easily, you know. And what about the wound itself? Should I keep cleaning it? Bandaging it? Or should I leave it alone? Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. You're the doctor, you tell me. And will it… will it smell? I've heard infected wounds can smell awful. And one more thing… Will I be contagious? My grandson, Keoni, comes to visit often. I don't want him to get sick. He's a good boy.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Louine. I’m glad you asked. Yes, please continue to keep the wound clean with soap and water, and apply a clean bandage daily. That will help prevent further infection. We'll also want to keep it covered as much as possible. It’s also a good idea to elevate your foot whenever possible. As for the smell, infected wounds can sometimes have an odor, but we'll do everything we can to minimize that with proper cleaning and the antibiotics. If it becomes particularly noticeable, please let me know right away. Regarding contagiousness, the infection itself is not highly contagious through casual contact. However, it’s always best to be cautious. I recommend Keoni avoid direct contact with the wound itself, and encourage him to wash his hands thoroughly after being around you. I will write detailed instructions for wound care and the antibiotics, including potential side effects to watch out for. If you experience any severe nausea, dizziness, or rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact my office. I also want to schedule that follow-up appointment now, just to be sure we get you on the right track. How does next Tuesday at 2 pm sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2 pm… Yes, that will do. As good a time as any, I suppose. And thank you for writing down the instructions. I tend to forget things, you know. It’s just… getting old. But I'll try my best to follow them. And I’ll definitely let you know if anything goes wrong. I don’t want this to get any worse. And Doctor… one last, last question. Do you think… do you think I’ll ever be able to wear sandals again? I love my sandals. They’re so comfortable. It’s just… I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Louine. And I understand how important your sandals are to you. While I can’t guarantee anything at this moment, I’m optimistic that you will be able to wear sandals again. Once the infection is cleared and the wound has healed, we’ll assess the condition of your foot and discuss appropriate footwear options. It may require some time and careful care, but I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t enjoy your sandals again. For now, let’s focus on getting this infection under control and allowing your foot to heal. I'm confident that with proper treatment and care, we can get you back on your feet, and hopefully, back in your sandals. Here are those written instructions. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Louine. Have a good day, and please take care.
