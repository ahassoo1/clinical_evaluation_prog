DOCTOR: Right. Terasa Mayhugh, 59. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. And I get dizzy sometimes. It’s hard to explain, it just… comes and goes. My daughter, Lani, she booked the appointment, actually. She worries about me. I don't always remember things as well as I used to, so… she thought it best to come.
DOCTOR: “Acting up,” is a bit vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is, isn’t it? It’s like… a fullness, sometimes. And other times, just… nothing. Like the sound just… goes quiet. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It’s just… not there. And then it comes back. It’s happened a few times now, I think. Maybe three? Four? I lose track. It’s usually with the dizziness, though. A spinning feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Let me think… It started… well, I think it was after my husband, Josaia, passed. That was… five years ago now? Maybe a little more? It hasn't been constant, mind you. It comes and goes in waves. It was worse at first, I think. But now… it's just… unpredictable. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: “Unpredictable” doesn’t really give me much to work with, Mrs. Mayhugh. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. Nothing I can put my finger on, anyway. I’ve tried to think… I don’t do anything particularly strenuous, you see. Just light housework, gardening a bit. I used to go to church a lot, but… it's harder now. I haven’t been sick, or anything. And I haven’t bumped my head or anything like that. It just… happens. My mother, she used to have trouble with her ears, come to think of it. A lot of earaches. Maybe it’s something I inherited?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing else, no. Oh! And sometimes a little something to help me sleep. But not every night. Lani gets worried I won’t get enough rest. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It all matters, Mrs. Mayhugh. Let’s start with the blood pressure medication. Do you know the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. It’s… a small orange pill, I think? No, wait… maybe it's a white one. It has letters on it… I really wish I paid more attention. Lani usually fills my prescriptions. I just… take them as she tells me. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with names. Is it important to know the exact name? I can ask Lani when I get home. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: It is, actually. Knowing what you’re taking is rather crucial. Alright. We’ll get that from Lani. Now, about this dizziness… does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, standing up too quickly sometimes makes it worse. And… bright lights, maybe? Not always, but sometimes if I’m in a very bright place, it feels a bit more intense. And loud noises, definitely. Like at the market, if it gets too crowded and noisy… I have to sit down. It's a spinning feeling, like the room is tilting. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just a few minutes. But it’s unpleasant. I haven’t fallen or anything, though. Thankfully. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination of your ears. I’ll need you to sit up straight and look forward.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds good. Anything to help, you know? I’ll try to sit very still. I don’t like things poked and prodded too much, but… I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. This won’t take long. Hmm. There’s some cerumen buildup in both ears. Nothing dramatic. The tympanic membranes appear intact, but slightly… dull. Now, I’m going to check your balance. I need you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Try to keep your balance as long as you can.
PATIENT: Oh dear… I’m not very good at this, I must warn you. I always have trouble with my balance. Josaia used to say I was like a newborn calf! I feel a little… wobbly. Are you sure I shouldn’t sit down? I don’t want to fall and cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, that’s enough. No need to push it. As I suspected, your balance is somewhat impaired. Given your symptoms – the ear fullness, dizziness, and balance issues – it’s likely you’re experiencing a mild form of vestibular dysfunction. This is often related to the inner ear, and can be exacerbated by cerumen buildup. We’ll start with a cerumen removal in both ears. That will hopefully improve your symptoms. We can schedule that for next week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… good. Cerumen removal? Is that… painful? I don’t like anything poking around in my ears. But if it will help… I trust your judgment. Next week is fine. Whatever is easiest for you. I just want to feel… steadier. And maybe hear a little better. It’s hard to follow conversations sometimes. So… that’s all for now? Just the cerumen removal next week?
DOCTOR: Yes, for now. We’ll reassess after the cerumen removal. If your symptoms persist, we may need to consider further testing, possibly an audiogram and a more in-depth vestibular assessment. I’ll also prescribe a course of meclizine, an antihistamine, to help manage the dizziness in the meantime. Take this with food, it can cause drowsiness. And avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. Here are your instructions and the appointment slip. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Meclizine… that’s a mouthful! And drowsiness… oh dear. I do like to go to my gardening club meetings. Perhaps I should ask Lani about that. No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I suppose I’ll see you next week then? Same time? .
DOCTOR: Yes, same time. And please, do have Lani review the medication instructions. It’s best to be cautious. Have a good day, Mrs. Mayhugh. .
