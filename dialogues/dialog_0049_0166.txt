DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s regarding some numbness in my leg. It’s been… persistent for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes I feel a bit of it in my foot too.
DOCTOR: Persistent, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening regularly for, oh, I’d say about three weeks now. Not constantly numb, mind you. More like… tingling that fades in and out, and sometimes a complete lack of feeling for a short time. It’s difficult to describe precisely.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. And is this numbness… constant when it is present, or does it fluctuate even within an episode?
PATIENT: It definitely fluctuates, Doctor. When it’s at its worst, it’s like my leg isn’t really there. But more often, it’s just a sort of… pins and needles feeling. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as intense, and it's lasting much longer. It seems to change depending on what I'm doing, too. I'll try to be more specific, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Specificity always helps, Mr. Kinjerski. Tell me, what activities seem to worsen it, and which, if any, relieve it?
PATIENT: Well, standing for long periods definitely makes it worse. I do a lot of work at my computer, animating, so I'm often sitting, which actually helps a little. Though even sitting for too long can bring it on. And walking… it’s a mixed bag, honestly. Sometimes it feels okay, other times it feels like I'm walking on pins. It’s rather unpredictable. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is… not ideal. Have you noticed any accompanying symptoms?
PATIENT: Accompanying symptoms… hmm. Not really anything major. Occasionally, a bit of a dull ache in my lower back, but I assumed that was just from sitting so much. And maybe a little weakness in the leg, but I haven’t really paid much attention to that. It's difficult to tell if it's weakness or just… a reluctance to put weight on it when it’s feeling numb. It's all very subtle, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Subtle can still be significant, Mr. Kinjerski. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Any history of injury to your back or leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I recall. I was quite active as a child—played a lot of basketball—but I don't remember any specific injuries that would explain this. Nothing major, certainly. A few scrapes and bruises, perhaps, but nothing that required a doctor's visit or anything like that. I did fall while hiking a couple of years ago, but I just twisted my ankle a little. It healed quickly.
DOCTOR: Hiking… alright. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother has arthritis, and I believe my grandfather, on my father’s side, had something with his nerves, though I don’t recall the specifics. Something about tingling and weakness, if I remember correctly. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t very close, so the details are a bit fuzzy. I do know my grandmother was very healthy, though, and lived to be quite old. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Occasionally, I'll take something for a headache, but that's it. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter pain relievers when needed. I generally try to avoid taking anything if I can. And I don't have any allergies, either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: If you could lie down on the table, please. We'll start with some basic neurological tests. I’ll need you to close your eyes and tell me when you feel a light touch. And then we'll assess your reflexes and strength.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know when you’re ready. I'll remain as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tell me when you feel this. … And here. … And here. … Right leg, now. … Okay. Good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. There… and now this one. Alright. Now, I need you to try and push your foot against my hand like you're pressing the gas pedal. Don’t tell me when you’re about to, just push as hard as you can. And now pull your foot up, like you’re stepping on the brake. Both legs, please. Hmm. Your reflexes are… within normal limits, though slightly diminished on the left side. Strength is also a little weaker on the left leg, but not drastically so. The sensation seems intact, but you did report a slightly delayed response in some areas. It’s subtle, as you said. But there is some asymmetry.
PATIENT: That’s… concerning, but not entirely surprising, I suppose. I had noticed my left leg feeling a bit less responsive sometimes. What could be causing this, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm a bit worried now, admittedly. Perhaps it's a nerve issue, given my grandfather's history? I understand if you need to run some tests to get a clearer picture.
DOCTOR: Given the asymmetry and your family history, a nerve issue is certainly a possibility. However, it could also be related to compression of a nerve in your back or even something more benign like a muscle strain. To be certain, I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to visualize the nerves and identify any potential causes for your symptoms. And I'm going to order some blood work to rule out other possibilities, like vitamin deficiencies or inflammation. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: An MRI and blood work sound… thorough, Doctor. That’s reassuring, honestly. No, I don’t think I have any immediate questions, though I might think of some later. Will the MRI require any preparation on my end? And how long will it take to get the results back? I also have private insurance, if that makes a difference. I’m trying to gauge how quickly I need to adjust my activities, you see.
DOCTOR: The MRI shouldn't require any specific preparation, just remove any metal jewelry. The radiology department will give you detailed instructions. As for the results, it typically takes 3 to 5 business days for the radiologist to interpret the images. Your insurance should cover it, but you'll want to verify with them beforehand. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Perhaps some gentle stretching and light walking. I'm also going to prescribe a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help manage your pain. It's a low dose, but it may provide some relief. Here’s the prescription, and the order for the MRI. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. We'll review the results together once they're available. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for your thorough assessment and clear explanations. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I'll schedule the MRI and follow your recommendations regarding activity and the medication. I'll reach out if anything changes or if I think of further questions. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care, Mr. Kinjerski.
