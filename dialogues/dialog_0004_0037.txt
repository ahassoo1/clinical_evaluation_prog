DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. It feels… tight in my chest sometimes. Like something is blocking the air.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Trouble breathing” is rather vague, Mrs. Kilton. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, my. I am sorry. Vague is not good, yes? It started… maybe two weeks ago? It comes and goes. Some days I feel alright, and other days… like today, it is harder. It’s worse when I walk, I think. Or if I try to do something… quick. Like carrying groceries.
DOCTOR: Two weeks. And you describe it as a whistling sound… and tightness. Does it feel like it’s getting worse progressively, or is it more intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent, I think. Not always the same. Some days it is just a little whistle, and I can ignore it. Today… today it is hard to even walk to the bathroom without stopping. It feels… heavier, if that makes sense? Not faster, just… heavier. And I cough a little sometimes, but not a bad cough. Just a tickle.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything that specifically triggers this, besides walking or exertion?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think. I do not know… I have been trying to be careful. I did some gardening last week, and it felt a little worse after that. Maybe the dust? Or the pollen. It has been very… flowery lately. Is that a trigger? I am not sure what a trigger is, exactly. But flowers might be it.
DOCTOR: A trigger is something that makes it worse, Mrs. Kilton. Pollen is certainly a possibility. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever or chills. And I sleep very well, thank you. No night sweats either. Just… tired sometimes. But I am 76 years old! A little tired is normal, yes? It is just this breathing that worries me. It is… not a comfortable feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. My mother had something with her chest when I was a little girl. She coughed a lot. I think it was… bronchitis? I was very young. As for me… I don’t think so. I have always been very healthy. I used to be an athletic trainer, you know. I kept everyone else healthy! I don't think I had pneumonia, but… it was a long time ago. I forget things sometimes. Is it alright if my daughter comes in? She is better at remembering medical things.
DOCTOR: We can certainly have your daughter join us, Mrs. Kilton. But let's try to finish gathering some information first. It will be quicker this way. Have you ever been diagnosed with heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That is good. Quicker is better. No, Doctor. No heart problems. The doctor always said my heart was very strong. Even when I was training the athletes, he said so. He listened with the… the tube, and he said it was a very strong heart. I had a checkup every year, until… well, until I moved here. It’s been a little harder to find a good doctor since then. But I have been feeling well, mostly. Just this breathing now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Never. I always told my athletes, “Smoking is bad for your lungs!” I would not do that. It is a very bad habit. My husband… he tried it once, when he was young. But I made him stop. It smelled terrible. It is very bad for your health.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take something for that too. Ibuprofen, I think it is called. And sometimes, just a little bit, for sleeping. But not every night. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was low. That is all, I think. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. I have never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always worries about that, but I am very careful. I try not to eat anything… strange. Just normal foods. Is that enough information? I hope I am not taking too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we can discuss possible causes and a plan. Please sit forward.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I am ready whenever you are. I hope it is not too serious. My daughter will be worried if it is.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and again. I am hearing some wheezing in your lower lobes bilaterally. Your respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, which is slightly elevated. Your oxygen saturation is 93%, which is borderline low. And your heart rate is 88 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Your blood pressure is 140/90. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, it appears you may be experiencing an acute exacerbation of some underlying respiratory issue. It could be bronchitis, or potentially something else. We need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… serious. Exacerbation? What does that mean, Doctor? And what do we need to investigate? Is it my lungs? I have never had trouble with my lungs before. Is it something I did? Do I need to go to the hospital? My daughter… she will be very concerned.
DOCTOR: An exacerbation simply means a worsening of a pre-existing condition, Mrs. Kilton. It doesn’t necessarily mean something new. We need to rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to assess for pneumonia or other lung abnormalities. And I’ll order a complete blood count to check for infection. We'll also do a sputum culture to identify any bacteria that may be present. As for your question about the hospital… not immediately. But we need to monitor your oxygen levels closely. And if they drop below 90%, or if your shortness of breath worsens significantly, you’ll need to go to the emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, my. So many things! X-ray… sputum culture… It sounds very complicated. I do understand… I think. So, if I feel worse, I go to the emergency room. And if not… we do the tests. Is that right? Where do I go for the tests? And will my daughter need to come with me? She is very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Kilton, that is correct. You will go to the radiology department here at the clinic for the chest X-ray. And the lab technician will collect a sputum sample for the culture. As for your daughter, it's up to you if you’d like her to accompany you. It's not necessary, but if it makes you feel more comfortable, certainly. Here is the referral slip for the radiology department. And I will have the lab technician come in shortly to collect the sputum sample. It’s a bit unpleasant, but important. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. That is very kind of you. Sputum sample… unpleasant? I will try my best. I suppose it is better to know what is wrong. No, I do not think I have any more questions right now. Just… when will I know the results? And what happens then? Will you call me? I hope my daughter will not be too worried. She is very protective.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24-48 hours. The radiology department will send them directly to me. I will review them as soon as they arrive and call you to discuss them. If your condition worsens before I call, go to the emergency room immediately. And yes, I will call. As for your daughter, I will document everything in your chart, so she can be informed. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I will go and get the tests done now. And I will be sure to go to the emergency room if I feel worse. You have been very helpful. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the staff know if you experience any difficulties. And do not hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen. .
