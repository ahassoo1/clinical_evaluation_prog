DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Lahn. It's good to meet you as well. Well, it's about my… peeing. Or, not peeing so good, really. It feels like I can't get it all out, most times. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's getting… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing difficulty fully emptying your bladder, and it’s been gradually worsening. That is bothersome, and we'll figure out what's going on. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start. That's a good question. Let me think… it wasn't sudden, that much I know. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. I'd say close to a year, maybe a little more. It started just being a little slow, you know? I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was just getting older. But it's definitely gotten worse lately. I have to… push a little more now, and still don't feel like I'm completely empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual onset over roughly a year, starting with just some slowness and progressing to needing to strain and still feeling incomplete emptying. That's helpful to know. Do you notice any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Sometimes, after I do go, there's a little dribbling. Not a lot, just a few drops. And… well, I get the urge to go often. Even when I don’t really need to, if that makes sense. It's like my bladder is telling me something even when it isn't full. It wakes me up at night sometimes too, which is… not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we've got dribbling after urination, increased frequency – feeling the urge to go often even when not full – and nocturia, or waking up at night to urinate. All of those things can be related. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not stinging, nothing like that. It just… doesn't finish. It feels normal going, just… incomplete. Like there's always a little bit left in there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or burning – that’s good. So, it’s more of a sensation of incomplete emptying without discomfort. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I was married for a long time, but my wife, bless her heart, she passed away five years ago. And… I don't really have much history. I've mostly been healthy, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. Nothing major. I get Medicare now, but I haven't really needed to see doctors much until this. I try to stay active, walk when I can, eat… reasonably.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you've been fortunate to have good health overall, besides the appendectomy and now this urinary issue. That’s good to know. And you're covered by Medicare, that's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix. I've never had anything else operated on. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Never really needed much fixing, until now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like prostate problems, bladder issues, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My wife’s family, they had some heart trouble, I think. Her mother, definitely. And… my father, he had some trouble with his… well, I don't remember exactly what, something with his stomach, I think. But I don't think anyone had problems with… peeing. Not that I remember, anyway. My family wasn't one for talking about such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some heart trouble on your wife’s side and some stomach issues with your father, but no known history of prostate or bladder problems. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill, I take it every morning. That's it. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I'll take some over-the-counter ibuprofen. But that's just now and then, when I really need it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you're taking a medication for high blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have the bottle here somewhere… …Amlodipine. That's it. Amlodipine. Five milligrams.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5mg daily for blood pressure. Good. And you're taking ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always said I was a tough old bird, and I guess she was right. I eat just about anything, and I've never had trouble with pills or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a brief external examination. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what's going on, and get it fixed if possible. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm not feeling any tenderness in your abdomen, and your reflexes are normal. The external exam appears normal as well. However, I'd like to check your post-void residual volume. This involves using a small ultrasound device to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound, you say? It doesn't sound too bad. As long as it doesn't hurt, I'm willing to try it. I just want to get to the bottom of this. Yes, go ahead. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your post-void residual volume is 280 milliliters. That’s a bit elevated. A normal residual volume is typically less than 50 milliliters. This suggests that you’re not fully emptying your bladder, which aligns with your symptoms. Based on your symptoms, medical history, and this finding, I suspect you may have bladder outlet obstruction or a condition affecting your bladder function. It could be related to an enlarged prostate – even though it’s less common in Yupik men – or another issue. To further investigate, I’d like to order a urinalysis to rule out infection and a prostate-specific antigen blood test. We may also consider a referral to a urologist for a more detailed evaluation, such as a urodynamic study. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds… complicated. A urologist? Is that serious? I just thought it was my age, maybe. But… if you think it's best, I trust your judgement. A PSA test and a… what was it? A urodynamic study? Is that going to hurt? I don’t like the sound of that. But I understand you're trying to figure out what’s going on. Yes, go ahead with the tests. If you think I need to see a specialist, I will. Just… please explain everything to me as we go. I'm an old man, I don't understand all this fancy doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hilber. I completely understand your concerns, and I will explain everything as we go. It's not necessarily serious, but it’s important to rule out any potential underlying causes and get you the best possible care. A urodynamic study is a test that measures how well your bladder and urethra store and release urine. It involves inserting a small catheter into your bladder and then measuring the pressure and flow of urine as you fill and empty your bladder. It can be a little uncomfortable, but we can provide local anesthesia to minimize any discomfort. The PSA test is a simple blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. Elevated levels can sometimes indicate prostate problems, but it’s not always a definitive diagnosis. I’m going to order the urinalysis and PSA test today. I will also write a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a urologist here in the city. She’s excellent. Once we have the results, we can schedule an appointment with her to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – about 8 glasses a day – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Eight glasses a day… that's a lot of water. But I can try. No caffeine, no alcohol… I mostly drink water anyway. Alright. And Dr. Sharma, you said? Is she… a good doctor? You said she’s excellent. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. It’s a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Sharma is highly respected in the field and has a very gentle and thorough approach. She'll be able to provide a more detailed evaluation and help us determine the best course of action. It is a lot to take in, and you're welcome. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Sharma. We’re here to support you. I’ll have the lab order and referral ready for you before you leave. And one last thing: if you experience any severe pain, fever, or inability to urinate at all, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll see you in a few weeks after you’ve had a chance to meet with Dr. Sharma.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will. I’ll try to drink more water and… avoid the caffeine. And I’ll keep your number handy, just in case. . .
