DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, I have cancer. It’s been… a little hard to talk about.
DOCTOR: Oh dear. I am so sorry to hear that, Chellsea. That is difficult to talk about. It’s alright to take your time. Would you mind telling me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Not at all. Um… it started a few months ago. I was feeling very tired all the time, even after sleeping. And then I found… a lump. It’s… on my side. I haven’t… I didn’t know what it was at first. My husband… he took me to a different doctor, but… he passed away a little while ago. That’s why I’m here now. I have Medicare.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry for your loss, Chellsea. That must be incredibly difficult on top of everything else. It’s understandable that things have been… a lot to process. Okay. So, fatigue and a lump on your side. Can you tell me a bit more about the lump?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it is. It’s hard to explain. It feels… hard, like a stone, but not exactly. And it… it doesn’t hurt, really. Just… feels there. It’s gotten a little bigger, I think. Maybe? It’s hard to tell. I haven’t… I haven’t been very good at checking it regularly. I just… avoid thinking about it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Chellsea. Avoiding thinking about it is a very common reaction when facing something difficult. You're doing the best you can. Okay. And where exactly on your side is it located?
PATIENT: Um… it’s… on my right side, Doctor. Kind of… under my ribs, but not right on the ribs. More… a little bit lower, towards my back. It’s… hard to point to, exactly. It’s not very big, but… noticeable. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Would you mind if I took a listen to your lungs and abdomen, and then I’d like to feel the area you’re describing?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… hope it doesn’t hurt. I’m not… good with pain.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, Chellsea. I'll let you know what I'm doing before I do it, and you can tell me if anything is uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. That… that makes me feel better. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing deeply for me… in and out… Good. Lungs sound clear. Now I’m going to listen to your abdomen. It may be a little cool. Just relax your stomach as much as possible… in and out… Alright… and now I’m just going to feel your abdomen. I’m starting here… Does this feel tender?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… normal, I guess. It feels… like my stomach, you know? Then… when you get closer… yes. That’s… a little bit uncomfortable. Not painful, but… I feel it. It’s… right there. It feels… hard, like you said.
DOCTOR: Okay. I feel a firm mass, roughly… about the size of a plum, on your right side. It’s not particularly warm to the touch, but it is somewhat fixed – meaning it doesn't move around very easily. It feels… irregular in shape. Chellsea, given your fatigue and the presence of this mass, it’s important we investigate this further. I'm concerned about the possibility of a cancerous growth, but it's too early to say definitively. I'd like to order some imaging tests – a CT scan, to get a better look at the mass and surrounding tissues. We'll also need to do some blood work to get a broader picture of your overall health. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood work… yes, that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… want to know what’s going on. I don't want to… just wait and worry. What will the tests… show? Will it… will it tell me if it’s cancer? And… what happens if it is? I… I don’t know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Chellsea, and it’s good you're asking. The CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of the mass - its size, shape, and location, and whether it's spread to any other areas. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. Will it tell us definitively if it's cancer?
PATIENT: Yes?
DOCTOR: It can give us a strong indication, Chellsea, but often a biopsy is needed for a definitive diagnosis. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the mass and examining it under a microscope. And if it is cancer… the treatment options depend on the type of cancer, its stage , and your overall health. We would discuss all of those options with you – surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of treatments. We have a wonderful oncology team here, and we’ll be with you every step of the way. It’s a lot to take in, I know. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I'll write you a referral for the CT scan and a lab order for the blood work. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. It’s… a lot. A CT scan… and blood work. And then… maybe a biopsy. And… an oncology team. Thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. And for being… gentle. I… I think I’m ready to get it over with. I just… want to know.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Chellsea. It is a lot, and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. That’s what we’re here for. Here are the orders for your CT scan and blood work. The CT scan will likely be scheduled within the next few days. The lab can take the blood sample anytime. I'm also going to give you the contact information for our oncology department, so you can reach out to them directly if you have any questions before your appointment. I want you to know that you’re not alone in this, Chellsea. We will support you through every step of the process. Do you need help scheduling the CT scan, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can… I can schedule it myself. I… I think I need to go now. I just… I need to process everything. Thank you, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Take your time. There’s no rush. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small. My number is on the paperwork. Take care of yourself, Chellsea. We’ll be here when you’re ready. .
