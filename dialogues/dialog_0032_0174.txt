DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s not a pleasure exactly, but a necessity. I suppose I’m here because… I haven’t been myself lately. It’s a long story, truthfully. I just feel… down. Very down. And it’s been going on for too long. I’d like it to stop, if possible.
DOCTOR: “Down,” you say. I understand. It’s good you're seeking help. It is often best to address these things. To get a clearer picture, could you elaborate on what you mean by “not yourself”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? It’s… a lack of enjoyment, mostly. Things I used to love – my garden, seeing my grandchildren, even just a good cup of tea – they don’t… spark joy anymore, if you will. And I find myself tired, always tired, even after a full night's sleep. I used to be very active, you know, with the lifeguarding and ski patrol. But these days… even getting out of bed feels like a struggle. It’s just… heavy. Everything feels heavy.
DOCTOR: A loss of enjoyment and persistent fatigue. I see. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started… hmm. Perhaps six months ago? Around November, I believe. It was after… well, after my divorce was finalized. It’s been building slowly, but these past few months it’s become quite… overwhelming. Honestly, I hoped it would just… pass. But it hasn't.
DOCTOR: A divorce finalized six months ago, and these feelings began around that time. It's understandable that a significant life change like that would be difficult, Mrs. Derasmo. While emotional distress can certainly manifest physically, we need to rule out other potential causes for your fatigue. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My appetite… it’s almost gone. I used to enjoy cooking, and eating! Now, I just… pick at things. My daughter keeps bringing me food, trying to get me to eat, but it’s… not appealing. And yes, I've lost weight. I haven't weighed myself properly in a while, but my clothes are looser. Much looser. I suppose that's not a surprise, if I'm not eating.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite and weight loss, along with the fatigue and anhedonia… We'll need to delve a bit deeper. Have you noticed any difficulties with sleep aside from just feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Trouble sleeping. I wake up very early, usually before dawn, and I can’t get back to sleep. I lie there for hours, just… thinking. Or not thinking, exactly. Just… being awake. And sometimes I have bad dreams. Nothing specific, just… unsettling dreams. It’s not a restful sleep, not at all. And I’m quite restless during the night, tossing and turning. It’s exhausting, even before I start the day.
DOCTOR: Restlessness, early morning awakenings, and unsettling dreams… Very well. Now, Mrs. Derasmo, are you experiencing any feelings of hopelessness, or have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a… a rather direct question, Doctor. Harm myself? No, no, nothing like that. I wouldn’t… I have grandchildren, you see. I couldn’t. But… hopeless? Yes. I suppose I do feel… hopeless. Like things will never get better. Like this… heaviness will just stay with me forever. It’s a quiet hopelessness, not a dramatic one. Just a… resignation. A feeling that things are unlikely to improve.
DOCTOR: I see. “Quiet hopelessness,” as you put it. We need to gather a more complete picture, Mrs. Derasmo. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. And arthritis in my knees, which is why I don’t ski patrol as much anymore. But other than that… nothing serious. I've always been a healthy woman, quite active, as I mentioned. I don't take any other medications regularly, just the one for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and arthritis. The EHR confirms this. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, no major surgeries. I had my tonsils out as a child, but that was… a very long time ago. And I was hospitalized once, many years ago, with a bad case of pneumonia. But that was before my children were born, I think. Nothing since. I’ve always been fortunate, health-wise. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child and pneumonia. Noted. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father… he suffered from anxiety, always worrying about things. He was a very nervous man. And my sister… she had depression, later in life. She received treatment, I think, but I don't know the details. It’s… not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, anxiety, and depression in the family. That is… relevant. Now, Mrs. Derasmo, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, I’m retired, as you know. I used to be very involved in community activities, volunteering at the library and helping with local events. But… I haven’t been doing much of that lately. I live alone since my divorce. I have two grown children, and several grandchildren, who I adore. But they live far away. I speak with them on the phone regularly, but it's not the same as having them nearby.
DOCTOR: Retired, lives alone, two children, several grandchildren. A degree of social isolation, perhaps. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’m quite careful about what I take, generally. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing excessive. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, despite everything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Derasmo. Now, I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a basic neurological assessment. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. We'll start with your blood pressure. 138 over 82. Within normal limits, given your history.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I understand the need for it. Go ahead. I’m not particularly fond of doctors, truthfully, but I trust you’re doing what’s best.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Coordination and balance appear intact. The physical exam is largely unremarkable, Mrs. Derasmo. However, given your symptoms of fatigue, loss of enjoyment, changes in appetite and sleep, and the family history of depression, I believe it’s prudent to order some laboratory tests. Specifically, I’d like to check a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and Vitamin D levels. We'll also check a basic urine analysis to rule out any underlying infection.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I suppose that’s a good thing. If it helps to get to the bottom of this, I’m happy to cooperate. When will I know the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment? I’m rather busy, you see.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within three to five business days. The lab will notify my office once they are ready. I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’ve come in. It’s important to have a comprehensive understanding of your condition before making any decisions about treatment. I can tentatively schedule something for a week from today?
PATIENT: A week from today… Yes, that should work. Though I do have a bridge game scheduled that afternoon… perhaps we could do the morning? If that’s not possible, I suppose I can reschedule. I just… prefer to keep my routine, you see. It helps to maintain some normalcy.
DOCTOR: Let me see… Yes, I have an opening at 10:00 AM a week from today. That should accommodate your bridge game. We'll schedule a thirty-minute appointment to review the results and discuss potential next steps. In the meantime, I recommend trying to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even if you're not sleeping well. And if you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out to family or friends for support. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. Thank you for your time. I appreciate your attention to the matter. Though I do hope these tests don’t reveal anything… alarming.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab order will be sent electronically to your preferred facility. My staff will contact you to confirm the appointment. Please do not hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, Mrs. Derasmo. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
