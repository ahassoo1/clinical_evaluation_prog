DOCTOR: Good morning, Derick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Octavis, you said? Hmm. Well, it’s my face and legs, mostly. They’re… puffy. Been that way a bit now, I reckon. Not sure why though. It’s just… annoying, really. Not like it hurts or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, "puffy" face and legs. And you said this has been going on for a bit. Can you tell me roughly how long "a bit" is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time slips away, don’t it? Let me think… a couple of weeks, maybe? Could be three. Honestly, I don’t keep track of such things. Since Martha… well, everything kinda blurs together. She usually kept on top of these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you’re not sure on the exact timing. A couple of weeks is helpful. And I'm sorry to hear about Martha. Now, regarding the puffiness, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Same routine as always, I suppose. Get up, have some coffee… try to fix things around the house, though my back’s not what it used to be. Eat… well, what I can manage. Nothing special. It’s not like I’ve been on any trips or anything. Just… living, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent changes in your routine, diet, or travel. And you mentioned some back trouble as well. Is the back pain new, or has that been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, the back. That's been with me for years, really. Old work injury. Welding's not kind to your spine, you know? It flares up now and then. But this swelling… that’s new. And it’s… well, it looks bad, don’t it? My reflection startled me this morning.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the old welding injury. We'll want to keep that in mind. You're right to be concerned about the new swelling. Let's talk a bit more about the swelling itself. Is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yeah, I think it’s worse in the evenings. After I’ve been on my feet a bit. I usually try to put my feet up, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Mornings aren’t too bad, but by the time I’ve had my dinner… pretty noticeable, it is. And my rings feel a bit tight, if you get my meaning.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do get your meaning – the rings feeling tight suggests swelling in your hands as well. Swelling that's worse in the evenings and after being on your feet is helpful information. Do you notice any pain associated with the swelling, or is it just the discomfort of feeling puffy?
PATIENT: Nah, not really pain. More… heavy, I’d say. Like my legs are filled with lead. And my face feels tight, like I’ve been at the dentist. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Makes me look older than I am, I suppose. Though at my age, what difference does it make?
DOCTOR: I understand. Heavy and tight, without sharp pain. We'll take all of this into consideration. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions, just to get a broader picture. Do you have any shortness of breath, or have you noticed any changes in your ability to breathe?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not that I’ve noticed. I get a little winded if I’m climbing the stairs, but that’s just getting old, I reckon. Never had any trouble breathing when I’m just sitting or lying down. Martha always said I snored like a freight train, but that was her complaint, not mine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no shortness of breath. And we'll note the snoring, though that sounds like a separate issue. Have you noticed any changes in your urine output – are you urinating more or less frequently than usual?
PATIENT: Urine… well, it's been… normal, I suppose. Not that I pay much attention, to be honest. Go when I need to go. No different than always. I don’t go rushing off to the bathroom every five minutes, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in urination. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, years ago. Put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after Martha… couldn’t be bothered, really. Everything just seemed… pointless. Never got around to seeing a doctor again. Nothing else, not that I know of. Always been a sturdy sort, I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, but not currently taking any medication for it. We'll need to address that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I can eat most things, though shellfish doesn’t agree with me. Gives me a bit of an upset stomach, but that’s about it. Never had any trouble with pills or anything like that. Martha used to give me all sorts when I had a cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, aside from some mild upset with shellfish. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not since… well, not since Martha. Used to take a multi-vitamin, I think, but that was a long time ago. Just coffee, mostly. Keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and face to assess the swelling. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Go ahead then. Might as well get it over with. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding, long as it doesn't take all day. And try not to be too rough, my back’s a bit sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be gentle. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 158/92. Elevated. I'm noting some significant pitting edema in both legs, up to the shins. And as you mentioned, some swelling in your face as well. I'm also noting some slight redness to your ankles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Mild swelling in the fingers, as you described. Okay, Derick, I've completed the exam. We've got elevated blood pressure, pitting edema in your legs, swelling in your hands and face, and some redness to your ankles. Given your history of high blood pressure and the new onset of swelling, I’m concerned about fluid retention, potentially related to your blood pressure. We need to run some tests to figure out what’s going on. I’d like to order a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel – that checks your kidney function and electrolytes – and a urinalysis. We will also want to get an EKG, just to rule out any heart issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Sounds serious. What does all that mean exactly? And will it hurt? I don't like needles much, to be honest. And what about my back? Will that show up in these tests?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Derick. The tests will help us understand why you're retaining fluid and why your blood pressure is elevated. They're not necessarily indicative of something serious, but they’re important to rule things out and get a clearer picture. The blood tests will require a small blood sample – you'll feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t hurt much. The EKG is completely painless – we’ll just place some stickers on your chest and arms to measure your heart’s electrical activity. The tests won’t directly show anything about your back, but if you’re experiencing pain, we can definitely discuss a referral to a specialist for that separately. Right now, we need to focus on the swelling and elevated blood pressure. The urinalysis is just a sample of your urine, which you will provide in a cup. Do you have any other concerns about the tests or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Sounds… alright, I suppose. A pinch I can handle. Just don't keep me waiting all day. And I don't want to be poked and prodded any more than necessary. What if it is something serious? What would I be looking at then? And will this cost me a fortune? I'm a bit… tight with my money, you see. Never really needed a doctor much after Martha…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about waiting, and I assure you, we'll get you seen as quickly as possible. I’ll also ensure the exam is as efficient and comfortable as possible. If the tests reveal something serious, it could range from kidney problems to heart failure, though it’s too early to say definitively. If that were the case, we’d discuss treatment options tailored to your specific condition. That might involve medication, lifestyle changes, or a referral to a specialist. I know you mentioned being tight with your money, and I want to address that. Given your insurance status, I can discuss options for financial assistance or lower-cost testing facilities. I can also help you understand the potential costs upfront so there are no surprises. Our billing department can work with you on a payment plan, if needed. Before we proceed with the tests, I want to reiterate that these are just to gather information. We'll discuss the results together, and I’ll explain everything in a clear and understandable way. Would you like me to get the lab orders started, and we can discuss financial options afterwards?
PATIENT: Go ahead with the tests, then. Get it over with. And please, no surprises. I can’t afford surprises. Just… do what you need to do, and tell me what it all means when you’re done. And maybe… maybe just go easy on me, alright? I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Derick. I’ll do everything I can to make this as easy as possible for you. No surprises, I promise. I’ll explain everything clearly and we’ll take things one step at a time. Okay, I've ordered the Complete Blood Count, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, urinalysis, and EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. She'll also get you set up for the EKG. It should take about 30-45 minutes altogether. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss them when you’re finished. In the meantime, if you feel unwell or experience any new symptoms, please let the nurse know immediately. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Just… get it over with, alright? And no poking and prodding, if you can help it.
