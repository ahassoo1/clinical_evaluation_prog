DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I am Dr. Yackey. So, if you could tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Yackey. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I don’t really need anything, not exactly. It's just... the paperwork said I needed to come in to get some forms filled out. Medicare asked for them, I think? I mostly just work with pipes and valves, so I don't usually come to doctors much.
DOCTOR: Right. Forms. Yes. Medicare does have a penchant for paperwork, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: You have no idea! It's always something with those forms. Is there anything specific I need to do besides just, you know, answer questions? I brought a pen, just in case.
DOCTOR: Well, ideally, we'd ascertain why these forms require completion. A basic medical history review is standard procedure, even if you perceive no immediate ailment. It’s… prudent. We'll start with the basics. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much in the way of medicine, honestly. Just the usual stuff for a cold, maybe. Nothing serious enough to worry about an allergy, I don't think. Is that okay? Should I be thinking harder about this?
DOCTOR: “Not really taken much in the way of medicine…” That is…uncommon. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. Just… vitamins sometimes, if I remember. But that’s it. My husband usually reminds me to take those, and even then, I forget half the time. He’s good about keeping track of things, but I really don’t take anything regularly. I feel pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a little girl, I had a pretty bad case of pneumonia, but that was a long time ago. I was maybe six or seven. I had to stay in the hospital for a week, I think. Other than that… not really. I broke my arm once when I was climbing a tree, but that didn't require a hospital stay, just a cast. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: A history of pneumonia… noted. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. I've always been pretty careful, and haven't needed anything major done. I mostly just get scrapes and bruises from work, but nothing that ever needed a doctor's attention, really. Are we getting closer to finishing these forms? My husband's waiting outside, and he doesn't like to wait too long.
DOCTOR: We are proceeding as efficiently as possible, Ms. Fabing. Now, regarding your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… okay. My grandma, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. She had it for a long time, I think. And my dad’s side… well, his brother had heart problems, but he didn’t take very good care of himself. Smoked a lot, drank a lot. That’s about all I know, really. Nobody really talked about health stuff much when I was growing up. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and heart disease… acceptable. And finally, a brief social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit a long time ago. It was hard on both of us, but he did it. I'm pretty proud of him. He says he did it for me, mostly. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. That will suffice for the preliminary review. Now, just to be thorough, and to complete the required documentation… I will need to perform a brief physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse, weight… standard procedure. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. No, no objections. That’s… that’s fine. I figured there’d be some kind of check-up involved. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not good with needles, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It will be a simple non-invasive assessment. Please remain seated and keep your arm still. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not critically concerning. Pulse is within normal limits. Now, weight. 70 kilograms. As documented. Do you engage in regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Well, I work with pipes all day. That's pretty physical, hauling things around and bending and reaching… It's not like I'm sitting at a desk all day. It’s hot work, too. Does that count? My husband and I used to go for walks more, but it’s been hard lately with everything.
DOCTOR: “Hauling things around…” That is not equivalent to structured exercise. And I am referring to deliberate physical activity, Ms. Fabing, not occupational labor. Lungs are clear. Resonance normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh. Reflexes? Okay. I guess that’s fine. I’m just… not very good at things like this. I always feel clumsy. Is it going to involve anything… scary? I used to trip over my own feet all the time as a kid.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are within normal limits. Examination is unremarkable. Alright, Ms. Fabing. That concludes the examination. Based on this limited assessment, and your provided history, it appears you are in relatively stable health. Though, I recommend addressing the slightly elevated blood pressure with lifestyle modifications, such as increased physical activity and a healthier diet. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… good to hear. Lifestyle modifications… that’s what my husband says too. I guess I don’t really have any questions. Just… what about the forms? Are we done with those now? Can I go get my husband? He’s probably getting worried. And will this information go to Medicare?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fabing, we are finished with the immediate requirements of the forms. I will submit the completed documentation to Medicare as per protocol. And yes, you may retrieve your husband. I have a waiting room full of patients, so I must excuse myself. If you experience any concerning symptoms, schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you explaining everything. And thank you for not making me feel… too clumsy. Have a good day.
