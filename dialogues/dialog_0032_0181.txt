DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 74 years old. Please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pipkorn. Yes, seventy-four years, give or take a few days. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you understand. Preventative, as they say. I like to keep an eye on everything, if possible.
DOCTOR: Preventative care is… sensible, I suppose. Though, frankly, most people don’t bother until something is actively wrong. Alright, a general wellness check and lab panel. I’ll need to gather some information first. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. Let me see… nothing formally diagnosed, no. My father had some trouble with his heart when he got older, but I’ve been fortunate so far. I do get a little stiffness in my joints sometimes, especially in the mornings, but I attribute that more to the work, you know? Construction is not… kind to the body. Blood pressure… the doctor at home checks it occasionally, and it’s usually fine. Nothing alarming, at least. I haven't had diabetes, no.
DOCTOR: "The doctor at home?
PATIENT: Apologies, Doctor. My wife, actually. She’s a retired nurse. Very capable, and keeps a close watch on me. She does the initial checks, and then we see our regular physician for a more thorough examination once a year. It’s just… easier that way, sometimes. And she's remarkably observant. She caught my cholesterol creeping up a few years back, before anyone else did.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that is… resourceful. Though I still prefer a professional assessment, naturally. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Perfectly understandable, Doctor. A professional eye is always best. As for surgeries… let me think. When I was quite young, perhaps eight years old, I had my tonsils removed. A rather unpleasant experience, as I recall. And… oh, yes. About fifteen years ago, I had a repair to a torn rotator cuff. It was a consequence of, again, the construction work. A fall, unfortunately. Apart from those two, no. No significant hospital stays, thankfully. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, rotator cuff repair fifteen years ago. And no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Good. Now, family history is quite important. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My mother passed away about twenty years ago. A long illness, sadly. My father… he went a bit earlier, perhaps twenty-five years ago now. Heart trouble, as I mentioned before. He was a strong man, but… it runs in the family, it seems. I have two sisters, both living. My older sister is very healthy, thankfully, still quite active. My younger sister had some issues with her blood pressure a few years back, but she’s managing it well with medication, I believe. We keep in touch, of course. It’s good to know what’s happening with them, for my own peace of mind, if nothing else.
DOCTOR: Heart trouble in your father, hypertension in your younger sister. Noted. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she’s quite strict about that, actually. And I’ve always believed it was best to avoid it. Bad for the lungs, bad for everything, really. And I do enjoy a good, deep breath when I’m working. It’s important, you understand? No, I've never smoked. And I don't have any intention of starting now.
DOCTOR: A… commendable lifestyle choice. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Very occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. Or a small beer with friends. Nothing excessive, I assure you. It’s more of a social thing, really. I don’t drink to excess, and certainly not every day. My wife and I… we’re fairly moderate in our habits. I wouldn't say I drink, exactly. More of a… a civilized indulgence, from time to time.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. And occasionally, ibuprofen for aches and pains, especially after a long day at the construction site. Nothing regular, mind you. Just when I need it. And… oh, yes. My wife gives me fish oil capsules sometimes, for my joints. She’s very keen on those. Apart from those, no. No prescription medications, thankfully. I prefer to avoid them if possible, you understand? A bit of ibuprofen and a good night’s sleep usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. And I will need to listen to your lungs, naturally.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. My wife will be pleased to hear you're taking such a thorough approach. She always insists on a comprehensive check. Proceed when you are ready. I’m entirely at your disposal.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart rate is regular, but a bit strong. I detect a slight murmur, which could be benign, but we’ll need to investigate further. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there’s a slight decrease in breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Your joints feel… somewhat stiff, but no acute inflammation. Overall, your physical exam is reasonably unremarkable, but those findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: A slight murmur, you say? And decreased breath sounds? That doesn’t sound… entirely good, does it? My wife mentioned something about a little wheezing after I’ve been working hard, but I dismissed it as just being out of shape. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. I’d rather know now if there’s something to be concerned about, even if it’s nothing serious. What sort of investigation are you thinking of? Blood tests, perhaps? An X-ray? I’m prepared for whatever you recommend.
DOCTOR: Dismissing symptoms is rarely advisable, Mr. Mombrun. A slight murmur requires an echocardiogram to assess heart function. And the decreased breath sounds warrant a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. We'll also perform a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. These tests will provide a more detailed picture of your overall health and help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I’ll write up the orders now. The lab technician will draw blood, and then you’ll proceed to radiology for the X-ray. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: An echocardiogram and a chest X-ray… very well. I understand. It’s best to be certain, as you say. Allergies… no, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reaction to any medication, to my knowledge. My wife always asks the same question, and the answer is always the same. No allergies. I'm quite… unremarkable in that regard. But please, do double-check, just to be sure. It's better to be safe than sorry, as they say.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here are the orders for your blood tests and chest X-ray. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. Please take these with you, and they will guide you through the process. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is very comprehensive. I appreciate your attention to detail. Actually, yes. One question, if you don't mind. The decreased breath sounds… is that something to be particularly worried about? Could it be related to my work? Perhaps just dust and… and old age? Or should I be concerned about something more serious? I don't want to alarm my wife unnecessarily, but I would like to have a little more information before I explain things to her.
DOCTOR: Mr. Mombrun, it is precisely because you are asking such speculative questions that a proper diagnostic work-up is necessary. It could be related to occupational exposure, or it could be indicative of a more significant underlying condition. Until we receive the results of the X-ray, it is impossible to determine the cause with any certainty. I strongly advise against attempting self-diagnosis or causing undue alarm to your wife before we have a definitive understanding of the situation. Worrying accomplishes nothing. Let us obtain the necessary information first, and then we can discuss the findings and formulate an appropriate plan of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You are quite right, of course. I apologize for my… speculation. It’s just… I worry about her, naturally. She does so much for me, and I don’t want to cause her any unnecessary stress. You’re absolutely right. We should obtain the information first, and then we can discuss it calmly. I will follow your advice. No self-diagnosis, and no alarming my wife until we have a clear understanding of the situation. I appreciate your… firmness, Doctor. It’s reassuring to know you’re taking this seriously. I will proceed to the lab and radiology department now. Thank you for your time and attention. .
DOCTOR: See that you do. And please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Some patients… truly. Oh, and Mr. Mombrun?
