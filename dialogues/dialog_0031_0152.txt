DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol is a little high. They called it… hyper-lip-i-deemia? Something like that. It was from my regular check-up, and they wanted me to come talk about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, hyperlipidemia. That’s right. High cholesterol. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. It's good you followed up. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm 54, and mostly healthy, I think. I work as an aerospace engineer, so I’m on my feet a bit, but mostly sitting and thinking, you know? I don’t have any big problems… no diabetes or anything. Just… this cholesterol thing now. I’ve never had issues with it before. I have Medicare, if that matters. I’m single, live alone. Is that the kind of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very helpful, Ms. Geho. Thank you. Knowing your profession, living situation, and insurance are all important pieces of the puzzle. And it's good to know you haven't had prior issues with your cholesterol. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had a heart attack when he was pretty old, maybe in his eighties. My brother is okay, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other much. He lives in California. I don’t really know if anyone specifically had high cholesterol, but… heart problems, yes. Does that help? I can try to remember more if you need.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Geho, thank you. A family history of heart problems certainly increases our awareness. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. Hated it when others smoked, even. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. I try to eat pretty healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables, not too much red meat. Though I do like my cheese… is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, cheese in moderation is perfectly fine, Ms. Geho. I appreciate you being so forthcoming. Now, could you tell me about how much physical activity you get each week?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I’m on my feet at work some. But it’s not like I’m running around. Mostly walking to different parts of the building. And, uh… I try to walk the dog most days. He’s a big one, so it’s a good walk! Maybe… thirty minutes? Some days more, some days less, depending on the weather. I don’t really exercise exercise, if that makes sense. I used to swim more when I was younger, but not so much anymore. It’s hard to find the time.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Geho. Walking is excellent. It sounds like you're reasonably active. Before we discuss potential treatment options, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not afraid, but I’m not very flexible anymore.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It will be a standard exam - checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your abdomen. Nothing uncomfortable, I assure you. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please sit here, and relax your arm. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 138 over 82. We'll keep that in mind. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Everything sounds good there. Now, I’ll just quickly palpate your abdomen. Okay, Ms. Geho, that completes the physical exam. Everything sounds and feels normal. Now, let’s take a look at the specific numbers from your cholesterol test. Do you happen to have a copy of the lab results with you?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, Doctor. They just sent me a letter saying it was high. I figured you’d have the actual numbers here. I’m not very good with paperwork, to be honest. It all gets piled up. I just wanted to know what it meant and what I should do about it. Is it… really bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Geho. We have the results here. Let me review them... Okay, so your total cholesterol is 240 mg/dL. Your LDL cholesterol – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160 mg/dL. Your HDL cholesterol – the "good" cholesterol – is 45 mg/dL. And your triglycerides are 150 mg/dL. Based on these numbers, your LDL is elevated, which is the primary concern. It's not at a level that requires immediate, drastic intervention, but it does warrant attention. Now, to answer your question – should you be worried?
PATIENT: Okay… those numbers don’t mean much to me, to be honest. I just know “high” is bad. So… what does it mean? And what do I have to do about it? Is it something I can fix with diet, or do I need… medicine? I’m not a fan of taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question, Ms. Geho. Let me explain it in a simpler way. Think of cholesterol as fat in your blood. There are different types. LDL cholesterol can build up in your arteries, like plaque in a pipe, making it harder for blood to flow. That's why it's important to keep it at a healthy level. HDL cholesterol actually helps clear cholesterol away, so you want that number to be higher. Your LDL is a bit too high, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke over time. Your HDL is within a reasonable range, but could be improved. Now, regarding what you have to do about it… In many cases, lifestyle changes can significantly improve cholesterol levels. We can start with those. Specifically, a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. We’ll discuss what that looks like for you. However, given your LDL level, and based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, it's likely you will also benefit from medication. A statin medication would be the most common approach. But before we jump to that, let’s see if we can make some positive changes with diet and exercise for the next three months. We can re-check your levels then and see if that's enough. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… three months. That sounds… reasonable. I can definitely try to eat better and walk more. What kind of diet are we talking about? I like cheese, like I said, and I don’t want to give up all my favorite foods. And what about exercise? Do I need to join a gym? I’m not very good at running or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Geho! We’re not talking about a drastic overhaul here. Small, sustainable changes are key. As for diet, we want to focus on reducing saturated and trans fats, which are found in things like red meat, processed foods, and full-fat dairy. You don’t need to eliminate cheese completely, but moderating your intake is important. Think about choosing lower-fat options when possible. We want to increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein – fish is a great choice. I have a handout here that outlines a heart-healthy diet, with specific recommendations. As for exercise, you definitely don’t need to join a gym! Brisk walking is a fantastic form of exercise, and you’re already doing some of that with your dog. We aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week - that’s about 30 minutes most days of the week. We can start slowly and gradually increase your activity level. Do you have any questions about the diet or exercise recommendations?
PATIENT: Okay, this is… a lot to take in, but it doesn't sound impossible. I can try to follow this diet, I think. And I can definitely walk more with Buster, my dog. He'd like that! What about… side effects of the medicine? If I do need it, what am I looking at? I’ve heard some bad things about statins. And what if it makes me feel sick?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Geho. It’s important to be informed about potential side effects before starting any medication. Statins are generally well-tolerated, but like all drugs, they can have side effects. The most common side effect is muscle aches or weakness. This is usually mild and goes away on its own, but it's important to report it to me if it happens. Other, less common side effects can include liver problems and an increased risk of diabetes, but these are rare. We’ll monitor your liver function with blood tests if you do start a statin. And if you experience any bothersome side effects, we can always adjust the dose or try a different medication. It’s important to remember that the benefits of lowering your cholesterol and reducing your risk of heart disease often outweigh the risks of taking a statin, especially given your family history and current LDL level. For now, let's focus on the lifestyle changes. We’ll re-check your cholesterol in three months, and then we can decide if medication is necessary. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Three months to try. And then we’ll see. I can do that. I’ll try to eat better and walk more with Buster. What happens if I don’t see any change after three months?
DOCTOR: If you don't see a significant change after three months, it doesn't mean you've failed! Sometimes lifestyle changes alone aren't enough. That’s when we'll discuss starting a statin medication. We'll review your lab results again, assess your overall risk factors, and talk about the potential benefits and risks of medication in more detail. We'll make a decision together that you're comfortable with. For now, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today, August 2nd. That would be November 2nd. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: November 2nd sounds good. Yes, that’s fine. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I still feel a little worried, but I feel better knowing what to do. And knowing I don't have to start medicine right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Remember, we’re a team in this. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s a copy of the handout we discussed, and a summary of today’s discussion. I wish you all the best with your lifestyle changes, and I look forward to seeing you in November. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
