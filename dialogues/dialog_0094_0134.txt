DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…it’s my stomach, mostly. Been feeling quite unwell, I have. Not bad bad, you understand, just…off. And I get full so quickly these days. It’s a bit worrying, really. I don’t remember when it started exactly, maybe a few weeks now? It all just sort of…faded in.
DOCTOR: Okay, "faded in" is a good way to describe it. A few weeks of feeling “off” and getting full quickly… I understand. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When you say "off," can you describe that feeling a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specifics…that’s hard. It's not pain, not really. More like…a queasiness? A sort of unsettled feeling, all the time. And sometimes, right after I start eating, even just a few bites, I feel like I couldn’t possibly eat another thing. It’s…odd. I used to have a good appetite. I raised five children, you know, so I’m used to enjoying a good meal! But now… it’s just not the same. I don’t even know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Kelder. Changes in appetite are very common, and it’s helpful to know it's not pain, but more of a queasiness and early fullness. So, it sounds like the queasiness is fairly constant, and the early fullness is a more recent development. To help me understand further, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the queasiness and fullness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… other symptoms. Well… sometimes I feel a little tired, more tired than usual, I suppose. But I am 76, you know! It’s hard to tell what's just getting older and what's…something else. And… now that you mention it, I haven’t been sleeping as well lately. Just sort of restless, turning and tossing. No nightmares, just…uncomfortable. Does that count? I had a bit of heartburn a couple of times, too, but I thought that was just something I ate. You know, spicy food. I do enjoy a little spice.
DOCTOR: Yes, those all count, Ms. Kelder, thank you for sharing. Fatigue, restless sleep, and occasional heartburn are definitely things we should consider. And it's good you make the connection to the spicy food – we'll keep that in mind. Now, I'd like to ask about your eating habits. Have you noticed any particular foods that seem to worsen the queasiness or fullness?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t think so. It seems pretty random. I tried not eating fried foods, thinking that might help, but it didn’t make much difference. And I tried eating smaller meals, which helped a little with the fullness, but the queasiness is just…always there, sort of. It’s not like one specific thing sets it off. It's… frustrating, to be honest. I'm a pretty good cook, and I like to eat! I used to make a wonderful cornbread. Still do, sometimes, but I don't enjoy it as much, if you know what I mean. I just don't have the same… appetite.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Kelder, especially as someone who enjoys cooking and eating. It’s disheartening when something interferes with those pleasures. So, it sounds like it’s not easily triggered by specific foods, and smaller meals offer some, but limited, relief. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a hard question. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, and seen a lot of doctors. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was a long time ago, though. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a while back, but it’s been under control with medication for a good many years now. And…oh, and I was told I had some arthritis in my hands and knees, but that’s just old age, I figure. I’ve had cancer, too. I was diagnosed with… well, I can’t quite remember the type… something with the stomach, I think? It was a few years back, and I had treatment. They said it was… contained. But my memory isn't what it used to be. Is that helpful? I’m sorry I can't be more specific.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Kelder. Thank you for sharing all of that. Gallbladder removal, controlled blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of stomach cancer – all important pieces of the puzzle. It's perfectly alright that you don’t recall the specific type of cancer; we can look that up in your records. Just give me a moment to review your past medical history… Ah, here we are. It looks like you were diagnosed with early-stage gastric adenocarcinoma seven years ago, and you underwent successful surgical resection with no evidence of recurrence at your last follow-up. That’s good news. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, adenocarcinoma…that sounds right. Yes, surgery, yes. I remember that being… unpleasant. But if it’s gone, that’s wonderful. Let me think about medications… besides the blood pressure pills… I take something for my arthritis, a little white pill. I think it’s naproxen, or something like that. And sometimes, when my knees really bother me, I take Tylenol. Just the regular kind. Oh, and a Vitamin D supplement. My doctor told me I was low on that. I think that’s it. I try to keep track, but I forget things so easily these days. It’s a blessing and a curse, living a long life, you know. A lot of memories, but…they fade.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kelder. A long life is full of stories, and it’s natural for memories to become less clear over time. So, you’re taking medication for blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis, Tylenol as needed, and a Vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! Let me think… allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes after a bee sting when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. No food allergies, no problems with medications… I think I’m pretty lucky, actually. My mother was very careful about what we ate, and always checked with the doctor before giving us anything new. She was a practical woman. I miss her. But no, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Kelder. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, for a while, but I always made him go outside. Terrible habit, I thought. And my mother always said it was bad for you, so I never started. I always liked fresh air, and the smell of the woods. Cherokee land is beautiful, you know. Lots of trees. No, never smoked, and never will. It just never appealed to me. And my children all know better, too. Very proud of them.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Kelder. And very good to hear. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, occasionally. Very occasionally. A little glass of wine with dinner, maybe once a month, if that. Nothing more. My husband liked a beer sometimes, but I never really got into it. It just doesn't appeal to me much. I prefer a cup of tea. Or a glass of water. Something simple. I don't need alcohol to enjoy myself. And my doctor always told me to take it easy, so I do. Just a little sip now and then, if I’m feeling festive. But it’s not a habit, not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional, very light alcohol consumption. That's helpful. Now, tell me a little about your current living situation. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: Oh, I live alone now. My husband passed away several years ago. It’s been… quiet. But my daughter lives about an hour away, and she comes to visit every couple of weeks. She's a wonderful girl, very helpful. And my son lives a bit further, but he calls often. I have a good neighbor, too, Mrs. Peterson. She checks on me sometimes and brings me cookies. I try to stay active, you know? I still do some gardening, and I volunteer at the local library. I like to keep busy. It helps to keep my mind sharp, I think. But mostly, it's just me now. A quiet life, but a good one. A peaceful one.
DOCTOR: That sounds very nice, Ms. Kelder. A good support system and staying active are both very important. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Just a routine check to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds fine, Doctor. Anything you think will help. I trust your judgment. I've seen a lot of doctors in my life, and you seem very thorough. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I'm not as spry as I used to be, you know! But I’ll try my best. Go ahead, then. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Thank you, Ms. Kelder. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Now, let's check your abdomen. I'm going to gently press on different areas of your belly. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. I'm noting some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no significant masses or guarding. Your abdomen is soft overall. And finally, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning given your history. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, but the tenderness in your upper abdomen warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, tenderness, you say? Well, that’s not surprising, really. I do get a bit of indigestion sometimes. And I've had stomach trouble in the past, you know, with the cancer. Is that what you think it is, Doctor? Something to do with that? I do worry about it sometimes, even though they said it was contained. I just want to be sure everything is alright. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re concerned, Ms. Kelder, especially given your history of stomach cancer. The tenderness in your upper abdomen could be related to that, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities. Given your symptoms – the queasiness, early fullness, and tenderness – and your past medical history, I’d like to order a few tests. I recommend a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and an upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and take biopsies if needed. It's the best way to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out any recurrence of cancer or other problems like ulcers or gastritis. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… an endoscopy… that sounds… unpleasant. I remember having something like that before, with the cancer. It wasn't very comfortable, if I recall correctly. But… if it's the best way to be sure, I suppose I have to do it. I just want to know what’s going on. What are the risks, Doctor? Is it very painful? And how long will it take? I don't like being poked and prodded, you know. I'm an old woman, and my bones aren't what they used to be. But… if it's necessary, I'll do it. Just tell me everything I need to know. And… will it keep me from gardening? I do enjoy my tomatoes.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask those questions, Ms. Kelder. It's important to be fully informed. You're correct, an endoscopy isn't the most comfortable procedure, but we do everything we can to minimize discomfort. You will be given a sedative to help you relax, and a local anesthetic to numb your throat. Most patients don’t remember much of the procedure at all. The risks are relatively low, but they include sore throat, bloating, and, rarely, bleeding or perforation. We will monitor you closely throughout the procedure and afterward to minimize these risks. The procedure itself usually takes about 15-30 minutes. You will need to fast for at least six hours beforehand, and you will need someone to drive you home afterward, as the sedative can make you drowsy. As for your gardening, you’ll likely need to take it easy for a day or two afterward, just to allow your throat to recover. Avoid strenuous activity, but light activity like gentle walking is fine. You should be able to get back to your tomatoes within a few days. I'll write you a detailed order for the endoscopy and give you instructions on how to prepare. We can schedule it at your convenience. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything, Doctor. Fast for six hours, sedative, someone to drive me home, easy for a couple of days… I can manage that. I’m just… anxious, I suppose. But I trust you, and I’m glad you’re taking this seriously. Can you tell me when I’ll get the results? And… what happens if they do find something? I don't want to think about that, but… I need to be prepared. I've lived a long life, Doctor, and I’ve had my share of troubles. But I still want to enjoy my tomatoes, if you understand. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, a little. Just… please let me know as soon as you know something.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Kelder. And you're right to ask about what happens if we do find something. It's best to be prepared. The results of the biopsy usually take about 5-7 business days to come back. As soon as I have them, I will call you immediately to discuss them. If the biopsy reveals something concerning, we will discuss all of your options for treatment, which could include medication, surgery, or other therapies. We will tailor the treatment plan to your specific needs and preferences. I want to reassure you that we will be with you every step of the way. We’ll answer all of your questions and provide you with the best possible care. For now, let's focus on getting the endoscopy scheduled. We can also discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist if you’d like to see a specialist. Do you have any preferred dates or times for the procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist sounds wise. Yes, a gastroenterologist, that would be good. I always liked having a second opinion, just to be sure. As for dates… let me see. Next week might be difficult. My daughter is visiting. The week after that would be better. Perhaps Tuesday or Wednesday? I don’t have anything planned then. And… I’d prefer in the morning, if possible. I like to have the rest of the day to recover. If that’s alright, Doctor. I’m not very good at rushing. Thank you again for all your help. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old woman and her worries. I appreciate it more than you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s my pleasure. And yes, scheduling with a gastroenterologist is a good idea. I'll go ahead and put in a referral for you now. I will also have my nurse schedule the endoscopy for you for either Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week, in the morning, as you requested. She will coordinate with the gastroenterologist’s office to find a time that works for everyone. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please call my office immediately. Here’s a summary of our plan: Referral to a gastroenterologist Upper endoscopy scheduled for next week Fasting for six hours before the procedure Arrange for transportation home afterward Do you have any questions or concerns before we conclude our visit today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you. Thank you so much for listening, and for taking my worries seriously. And for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. I’ll just wait to hear from your nurse about the endoscopy and the specialist. I suppose… that’s all. I appreciate your kindness, and I’m glad I came to see you. It’s reassuring to know there are good doctors still around. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very kind, Ms. Kelder. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. We’ll take excellent care of you. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day as well, and enjoy your tomatoes!
