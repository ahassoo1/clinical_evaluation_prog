DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. It’s about pain, down… there. It’s not my pain, exactly… it's my son's. He's… well, he’s been having some discomfort. I brought him, but… I'm afraid I don't recall all the specifics. It all happened rather quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have all the details right now – we can work through it together. It’s good you brought him in. So, your son is experiencing some discomfort… “down there,” as you said. Can you tell me a little bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Oh dear. It was… not long ago, I don't think. Perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. He didn’t say much at first, just that he felt… unwell. It wasn’t until recently that he mentioned the pain specifically. He’s a bit shy, you see. I truly wish I could be more precise, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Noelani. A week or so is helpful. And it’s very understandable he’d be shy. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. He… he said it was a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. But it’s… persistent, he said. It doesn't come and go, not really. It’s just… there. And he’s been… favoring one side when he walks, I noticed. He didn’t want me to make a fuss, but I insisted we come in. I just want to be sure everything is alright. It's probably nothing, right?
DOCTOR: It’s good you brought him in, and it’s very thoughtful of you to be so attentive to his needs. A persistent dull ache and favoring one side when walking… that gives us some information to work with. Can you tell me where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. He… he didn’t specify, exactly. It’s… in the groin area, I believe? That’s where he was holding, when he told me. It’s hard to say precisely. He’s… private, you see. And I didn’t want to press him too much. Is that… is that helpful, Doctor? I feel terrible not knowing more.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. It's understandable. The groin area is helpful. And you’re doing the best you can. Has he had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms along with the pain – like difficulty urinating, or any redness or swelling in that area?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No fever, I’m quite sure. And no chills. He hasn't mentioned any difficulty urinating… no. And I haven't noticed any redness or swelling, no. He's been… a little tired, perhaps? But he’s always been a bit of a quiet one, so it’s hard to say if that’s different. He also said he felt a little nauseous yesterday, but that could be from anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, difficulty urinating, redness or swelling, a little tired, and some nausea… That helps. Now, just to get a better picture, has your son had any recent injuries to that area, like a fall or a sports injury?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Injuries… Let me see. He plays soccer, you know. But he’s very careful. I don’t recall any specific injury, no. He might have had a small scrape a few weeks ago, but nothing major. Definitely nothing that would cause… this. He’s generally quite healthy, Doctor. This is… unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent significant injury. And he generally healthy. To get a complete picture, could you tell me about his past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. His past medical history… He's had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. He had his vaccinations, of course. And… I think he broke his arm once, when he was little. But that was years ago. He doesn’t have any… chronic conditions, no. He's a pretty sturdy boy, usually. I can’t think of anything else… I wish I was more helpful. This is all… a bit of a blur. Is it alright if we just… examine him? Perhaps that will be more informative.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. We can definitely do an examination. It’s perfectly alright that you’re feeling a bit flustered – it’s understandable. Before we do that, just a few quick questions. Does he have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… No, not that I know of. He’s never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. He eats everything, and we haven't had any issues with medications either. He's had antibiotics a few times for colds, and never any problems. I think he’s pretty clear, Doctor. Truly. Shall we proceed with the examination then? I’m eager to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And yes, let’s proceed with the examination. I’m going to need to ask your son to get changed into a gown. We’ll start with a physical exam of his groin area and abdomen. I’ll explain everything as I go. Would you mind stepping out for a moment so I can speak with him privately, and he can get changed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. I’ll just… wait out here then. Please, let me know if you need anything at all. I trust your judgement completely, Doctor. I’m just… anxious to know what’s going on. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. Thank you. I'll let you know as soon as I have some initial findings.
