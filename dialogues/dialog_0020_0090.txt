DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Um… well, I believe I’m here for some… clearance? For a surgery I’m hoping to have. It’s… a bit difficult to recall all the details, truthfully. It’s been a trying few years.
DOCTOR: Okay, surgery clearance. That's a good place to start. It is understandable that details can be fuzzy, especially with a lot on your mind. No worries, we'll take it slow. Do you remember what type of surgery you're planning to have?
PATIENT: It… involved my face, I think. Something to do with… improving the appearance, perhaps? It was my husband's idea, mostly. He always had such good taste. I’m afraid I don’t recall the specific name of the procedure. It was discussed with another doctor… a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, facial surgery, elective, discussed with another doctor… that gives us something to work with. Do you happen to remember the doctor's name, or where you saw them?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is… escaping me, I'm afraid. It was a clinic downtown, I believe. A larger one? I truly wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. My memory hasn't been the same since… well, since my husband passed. Everything feels a bit… clouded.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mackenzi. Grief can certainly have that effect. We'll do our best with what we have. Let’s try a different approach then. Perhaps we can focus on why you're seeking this surgery now?
PATIENT: Well… It's difficult to explain. My husband… he always admired beauty. And he thought… he thought I deserved to feel beautiful too. It feels like… a way to honor him, perhaps? To carry on something he valued. And… truthfully, I haven’t really… taken care of myself much since he’s been gone. It feels like a fresh start, maybe? I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mackenzi. It sounds like a very meaningful reason. So, to clarify for my records, you're considering facial surgery primarily for personal reasons, as a way to honor your husband and feel more like yourself again?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… precisely it, Doctor. You’ve summarized it beautifully. It’s just… I want to be sure I’m healthy enough for it, of course. I wouldn’t want to cause any… complications. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. To be certain.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's very sensible. Let’s start with a brief physical exam and review of your medical history. I'll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and just get a general sense of your overall health. Then we can go over any past medical issues, allergies, and medications you're currently taking. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse. And while I’m doing that, can you tell me your height and weight, if you happen to know them?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… I believe I’m around… five foot two inches? And… about one hundred and fifty pounds, give or take a few. It fluctuates, I'm afraid. I haven’t been very consistent with… well, with anything, lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 135/85, pulse is 82. Not bad. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. And another… Good. Everything sounds clear. I don’t hear any unusual sounds.
PATIENT: Very well. Is everything alright, Doctor? Are those… good results? I apologize if I'm being overly anxious. It’s just… I haven't had a thorough checkup in quite some time.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far, Mackenzi. Perfectly normal findings. Don't apologize at all – it’s perfectly reasonable to be a little anxious. It’s good you're taking this step. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I’m aware of. My husband always took care of those things. He was very diligent about doctors’ appointments and… everything. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, no. I did have… a bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was all. And… a mild allergy to pollen, perhaps? It’s not very severe. I just… sneeze a bit in the spring.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions, mild seasonal allergies… that's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, I believe. And… I think… a minor procedure on my hand, years ago, after I cut myself gardening. It wasn’t anything serious, just a few stitches. My memory is so… fragmented. I truly apologize for being so vague. It feels like… a fog.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Mackenzi. It’s completely understandable, especially with everything you’ve been through. Wisdom teeth removal and a minor hand procedure… that's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. Not at all. Occasionally, I’ll take… an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, perhaps? But that’s… infrequent. Nothing prescribed, no. And I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. I’ve always preferred a natural approach, when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional pain reliever. And lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, besides pollen?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I recall. I've never had a reaction to anything. I think… my husband said something about a mild sensitivity to penicillin, perhaps? But it was a long time ago, and I’ve never taken it myself. I’m not certain. I truly apologize for the uncertainty, Doctor. I wish I could be more precise. It feels like… trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild sensitivity to penicillin, but you’ve never personally reacted. That’s good information. It sounds like we’ve covered the main points of your medical history. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to ask about your family history… any significant illnesses in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a difficult question. My family… My mother passed away when I was young, from… complications after childbirth, I believe. And my father… he had heart trouble, later in life. I believe my brother is healthy, though. He lives quite far away, and we don’t speak often. I’m afraid I don’t know much about his medical history. It’s been a long time, Doctor. And… truthfully, I haven’t thought about it much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother passed away from childbirth complications, father had heart trouble… I understand. It's okay if you don't have all the details. Now, just a few final questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I never partook. And I certainly don’t drink alcohol or… use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’ve always preferred a quiet evening at home, with a good book.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mackenzi. That gives me a very good overview of your medical history. Now, to determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery, I'd like to order a few routine blood tests. This will help me assess your overall health, check your kidney and liver function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you deem necessary, I trust your judgment entirely. Blood tests are fine. I just want to be sure everything is… in order. Before we proceed. Could you perhaps explain the risks involved with the procedure? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mackenzi. It’s important to be fully informed. The specific risks will depend on the type of facial surgery you're considering, but generally, all surgical procedures carry some degree of risk. These can include infection, bleeding, scarring, nerve damage, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. In rare cases, there can be more serious complications. We will take every precaution to minimize these risks, and I’ll discuss them in detail with you once we know more about the specific procedure. For now, let's focus on getting these blood tests done, so we can assess your overall health and determine if you are a good candidate for surgery. Do you have any questions about the blood tests themselves?
PATIENT: No… not about the tests themselves. But… if I am a good candidate… what would the recovery process be like? How long would I need to… take off work? And… would there be visible scarring? I work with the public, you see. It’s important that I… present a certain image. I apologize for asking so many questions. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly normal to be concerned. The recovery process varies depending on the procedure. Generally, you can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort for the first few days to weeks. Pain medication can help manage this. You'll likely need to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks, and follow specific instructions regarding wound care. As for time off work, that also depends on the procedure. Some minor procedures may only require a few days, while more extensive surgeries could require several weeks or even months. Regarding visible scarring, we always strive to minimize scarring as much as possible. The extent of scarring depends on several factors, including your skin type, the type of procedure, and your body's healing process. I would discuss specific techniques to minimize scarring with you if you are a suitable candidate, and we can also explore options like camouflage makeup if needed. We will discuss all these factors in detail before proceeding with any surgery. How about this: let's get these blood tests done, and once we have the results, we can schedule a more detailed consultation to discuss the specific procedure, recovery process, and potential risks and benefits. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly sensible. Blood tests, then a more detailed consultation. I trust your expertise entirely. Please, let me know what I need to do. And… where I can go for the tests. I’m ready to proceed, whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here is a lab requisition. You can go to any lab that accepts this form. I've included the address of a few nearby labs on this sheet as well. They'll draw a small sample of blood and send the results to me. It usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. Once I have them, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up consultation. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Do you have any questions about the lab requisition or anything else before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… perfectly clear. The address and instructions are all there. I don't think I have any further questions at the moment. Thank you so much for your time and patience. I feel… much better informed now. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll go and get the tests done as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. We’ll be in touch once the results are back. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
