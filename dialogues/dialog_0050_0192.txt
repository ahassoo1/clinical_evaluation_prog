DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, pleasure’s all mine, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the army. Gotta get this thing done, you know? They want me to take it. Seems important. Don't see why they need a doctor lookin’ at me, but rules are rules, I suppose.
DOCTOR: An army physical, you say?
PATIENT: Physical? Yeah, that’s what they call it. Pre-recruitment. Sounds fancy. I build things, mostly. Engines, machines… not usually runnin’ around gettin’ poked and prodded. What exactly are you checkin’ for? I’m a perfectly healthy man, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your self-assessment, Mr. Hartness, a comprehensive physical examination is standard protocol for military recruitment. It’s not merely about confirming general health, but rather identifying any potential underlying conditions that might pose risks during service. We assess cardiovascular function, respiratory health, neurological status, musculoskeletal integrity, and more. It’s quite thorough. Now, to begin, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly? Not much to tell. Had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, chickenpox… when you're a kid, you get sick, right? Nothing serious. Broke my arm once fallin' out of a tree, but it healed just fine. Never been to the hospital for anything important. Don't really do sick. Why do you need to know all this anyway? Does this have somethin' to do with whether I get in?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Hartness. The army has specific health requirements for enlistment. We need to ensure you meet those standards to protect both your well-being and the readiness of the force. Now, regarding your childhood illnesses, do you recall approximately when you had measles and chickenpox?
PATIENT: Approximate when? Look, that was… a long time ago. I was a kid! Maybe… early school years? Before I started helpin' my father in the workshop. Can't tell you exact dates, I wasn't keepin' a diary or somethin'. Chickenpox, I remember bein' itchy. Measles… red spots, I think. That's about it. Is this goin’ to take all day? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: It appears you've had no documented vaccinations. Do you recall receiving any immunizations as a child – tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, mumps, rubella, etcetera?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? You think I was runnin’ around gettin’ poked with needles as a kid? My father didn't believe in all that fancy stuff. Said it was better to build up your immunity naturally. Never had ‘em, no. Didn't need 'em. I’ve always been strong as an ox. Look, I’m tellin' you, I’m healthy. Are we done here, or are you gonna keep askin’ about things that happened when I was knee-high to a grasshopper?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, your lack of documented vaccinations is a significant concern. It may preclude you from enlistment, regardless of your current health status. Now, let’s move on to your current medications, if any. Do you take any prescription or over-the-counter drugs regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? No! You think I need pills to get through the day? I work with my hands, I build things. I eat good food, get plenty of sleep… when I can. No medications. Absolutely none. This is ridiculous. What's next? Are you gonna ask me about my breakfast?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please step onto the scale, Mr. Hartness. Now, I need to document your height and weight for the record. Your weight appears to be… significantly lower than expected for someone of your height. 53 kilograms at 187 centimeters… That is quite low. Are you aware of any recent unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight? What's wrong with my weight? I'm a lean man! Always have been. Build muscle, not fat, you know? And yes, I’ve lost some weight lately, alright? Things have been… stressful. Workshop hasn't been doin' so hot. Doesn't mean I'm sick. What's it to ya, anyway? Is this goin' on my record? Will they not let me in if I’m a little thin?
DOCTOR: Significant unintentional weight loss is a cause for concern, Mr. Hartness, regardless of your occupation. It may indicate an underlying medical issue. Now, please follow me. I need to auscultate your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please lie back, and I will begin.
PATIENT: Look, I don’t like this. Poking and prodding… it’s undignified. I’m a grown man. Just tell me if there's somethin' wrong or not. Don't need all this fancy listenin' and feelin' around. I just want to get this exam over with. What are you even listenin' for? Is my heart broken or somethin'?
DOCTOR: I am listening for any irregularities in your heart rate and rhythm, murmurs, or other abnormal sounds. Now, please take a deep breath. Your respiratory sounds are… diminished bilaterally. And, do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or chronic cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No! I work hard all day, that’s all. Gets a little winded sometimes, but who doesn’t? Chronic cough? Maybe a tickle in my throat now and then. Dust from the workshop, you know? What’s all this mean, anyway? You makin’ me nervous now. Is there somethin’ wrong with me? Just tell me straight. Don't beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is… soft, but with some tenderness in the upper quadrants. Do you experience any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Tender? Yeah, a little! I haven't been eatin' so well, alright? Stress, like I said. Workshop hasn't been good. Bloatin'? Maybe… sometimes. Bowel habits… look, I don’t discuss those things with doctors! This is ridiculous. What are you lookin’ for? Is this gonna disqualify me? Will they laugh at me? Just tell me if I’m fit to serve, or not! This is gettin’ me nowhere.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but a thorough assessment is crucial. Your diminished respiratory sounds, abdominal tenderness, unintentional weight loss, and lack of documented vaccinations raise significant concerns. It is not possible to determine your fitness to serve based on this examination alone. I recommend further investigation, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a chest X-ray, and a referral to a gastroenterologist to evaluate your abdominal pain. Until these tests are completed, I cannot in good conscience recommend you for enlistment. Let me document these findings.
PATIENT: Tests… more tests… gastroenterologist? This is a nightmare. I just wanted to get this exam over with. But… will they even let me go? If I go to all these doctors, and they find somethin' wrong… is it over then? Fine. Do the tests. But… how long will it take? And… will it cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance, you know. I just want to serve my country. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The cost of these tests will depend on the facility and the specific procedures performed. I can provide you with a list of local clinics that offer financial assistance programs. The results will typically take 3 to 5 business days. I understand your desire to serve, Mr. Hartness, however, the army has strict medical standards for a reason. These tests are necessary to ensure your well-being and the safety of your fellow service members. I have documented my findings and recommendations. I will inform the army recruitment office of my assessment. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask. You are dismissed.
