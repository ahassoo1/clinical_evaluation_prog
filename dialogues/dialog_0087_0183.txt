DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Grumman. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Soodeen, you say? Hmm. Well, I been… tired. Real tired. Not just a little sleepy, but tired. Like my bones are heavy, you know? And the other doctor… she said something about my liver. That’s why I’m here, I guess. It feels… wrong. But I don't know much about livers.
DOCTOR: Okay, “real tired” and a feeling something is “wrong” with your liver. That’s a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? I just… wake up tired. Stay tired all day. Even if I sit and do nothing. It’s not like I’ve been working harder. Same work, same everything. Maybe a little worse lately. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It’s just tiring. Really tiring. And I don’t feel good. Everything feels… slow. Like I'm pushing through water.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, this fatigue is persistent – it doesn’t improve with rest, and it’s impacting your daily life. You mentioned it feels like pushing through water – is that a physical sensation, or more of a mental feeling?
PATIENT: Physical. Definitely physical. Like… when you carry something heavy all day. Your muscles ache, and you just want to stop. But it's not just my muscles. It’s… everywhere. Even breathing feels like work sometimes. You understand? It’s not in my head. I know my body. And it’s telling me something’s wrong. And the other doctor… kept talking about numbers and tests. I didn’t understand a word.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Grumman. It sounds very distressing to feel that heaviness and effort with basic activities. And it’s perfectly alright if you didn’t understand everything the previous doctor said – that’s why I’m here. I see here there were some liver function tests done recently. Do you happen to remember when those were completed?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It was… last month, maybe? Around the middle of July, I think. They took a lot of blood. The lady was very nice, but she didn’t tell me what she was looking for. Just poked and prodded and said it would take a week to get the results. Then the other doctor… called, but she talked so fast. Numbers… enzymes… I just nodded and smiled. I don’t understand those things. I work with cloth, not numbers. Do you understand them?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, Mr. Grumman. And I’ll certainly explain everything to you in a way that makes sense. It looks like the tests showed some elevations in your liver enzymes, which can indicate inflammation or damage to the liver. Now, these elevations can be caused by many different things, ranging from something relatively minor to something that requires further investigation. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, your lifestyle, and any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Questions are fine. As long as you don’t start talking about numbers again. I got enough of that already. My medical history? Not much to tell. I get a check-up once a year, usually. Wife makes sure of that. She worries too much. Lifestyle… I work. I come home. I eat. I sleep. Maybe watch a little TV. Nothing exciting. Other symptoms… just the tiredness. And sometimes… my stomach feels… bloated. Like I ate too much, but I haven’t. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Grumman. Bloating along with the fatigue. And it’s good to know you have a yearly check-up. Has anything changed in the past year – any new medications, travel, or significant changes in your diet?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Same everything. Same pills for my blood pressure, same food, same wife nagging me to eat more vegetables. I haven't left this town in… well, I don't remember the last time I went anywhere. Too expensive, and too much trouble. I like my routine. It's simple. I don't need excitement. Just want to feel… normal again. This tiredness is making everything hard. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. Is there something seriously wrong with me, doctor? You can be honest. I'm a grown man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your concern. It's natural to worry when you're not feeling well and don't know why. Based on what you've told me, and the initial lab results, we do need to investigate the cause of your fatigue and the elevated liver enzymes. I want to be upfront with you: it could be something serious, but it's also possible it's something more manageable. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a physical exam, including listening to your abdomen, and feeling your liver. I’d also like to order some additional blood tests to get a more detailed look at your liver function, as well as rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… more blood tests… Fine. Do what you need to do. I just want to know what’s wrong. This waiting and guessing is worse than the tiredness itself. I trust you, doctor. But please… explain things to me like I’m a simple man. No numbers, no fancy words. Just tell me what it means, in plain English. And try to be quick. I got things to do, even if I am too tired to do them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Grumman. I promise to explain everything in plain English, and I'll do my best to be as quick and efficient as possible. First, let's start with the physical exam. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement of your liver or spleen. This won’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, doctor. Everything aches these days. And don't take too long. This table isn't very comfortable. Feels like I'm back in the army. Bad memories.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Okay… a little tenderness here, on the right side, under your ribs. Not severe, but noticeable. Your liver feels slightly enlarged, but it’s difficult to say for sure without further investigation. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little… yeah, a little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been there for a while, actually. I just thought it was gas or something. My wife keeps telling me to watch what I eat, but I eat the same things I always have. She worries too much. Is that… bad? Is my liver really big? What does that mean? I don’t like this, doctor. Not one bit.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Grumman. It’s good that you pointed out the pain, even if it’s mild. The slight enlargement and tenderness could indicate some inflammation or congestion in the liver. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. As I mentioned before, I’d like to order some additional blood tests. These will give us a more detailed picture of your liver function, and help us rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, such as viral hepatitis or other liver diseases. We'll also check your kidney function and look for signs of anemia. While we wait for the results, it’s important to avoid alcohol, and any unnecessary medications. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids, and getting as much rest as possible. Would you like me to explain the specific blood tests I'm ordering?
PATIENT: No… no more tests right now. Just… do what you need to do. I trust you, doctor. But please… don’t tell me about every single little thing. I don’t understand those words, and it just makes me worry more. No alcohol… I haven’t had a drink in twenty years. My wife wouldn’t allow it. Fluids and rest… I’m already doing that. It’s not helping much. Just… tell me when you have the results. And tell me… what it means. In plain English. No numbers. No fancy words. Just… the truth. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Grumman, that is not too much to ask at all. I completely understand. I will order the blood tests now, and I promise to explain the results to you in plain English, without any medical jargon. I’ll focus on what it means for you, and what steps we can take to help you feel better. I'll also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results once they are available. It usually takes a few days for the lab to process everything. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, jaundice , or severe abdominal pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… get those tests done. And tell me what it means. That’s all I ask. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your time. And your patience. I know I’m not an easy patient. It’s just… hard, you know? Everything feels hard these days. .
