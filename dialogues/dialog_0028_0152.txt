DOCTOR: Right, Mrs. Geho. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. She said it was a little high on the tests. I don’t really understand what that means, exactly. It’s…hyper-something? I keep forgetting the word.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. Yes, quite common. Essentially, it means you have too much fat – cholesterol – in your blood. It’s… not ideal. Though, honestly, most people worry too much about it. Do you have any family history of heart problems or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart later in life. He didn't take very good care of himself, always smoking and… well, not eating the best foods. My mother was pretty healthy, though. Didn't have any problems that I knew of. Does that matter? Is that why I have it?
DOCTOR: It can matter. Genetics play a role, certainly. But lifestyle is… more impactful. Let's not dwell on your father. We’re focusing on you now. Have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel… fine. A little tired sometimes, maybe? But I'm 54, so… isn't that normal? I haven't had any chest pain or anything like that. Nothing that made me think something was wrong. That’s why I was surprised when the nurse said my numbers weren’t so good.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said just some fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, just the tiredness. It comes and goes. And… now that you mention it, my legs sometimes feel a little achy after I walk a bit. But I figured that was just from being tall, you know? Everything feels farther away! Is that… could that be it, too?
DOCTOR: Achy legs… Could be a number of things. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Let’s talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I try to eat pretty well. I have oatmeal for breakfast most days, with some fruit. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe a salad. And for dinner… it varies. Sometimes I cook fish, sometimes pasta. I do like a good steak every now and then, if I'm being honest. And I have a sweet tooth. I enjoy a piece of chocolate after dinner. Is chocolate bad? I love dark chocolate.
DOCTOR: It’s… not optimal. Dark chocolate is marginally better, but still. Let's move on. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, I walk my dog every day. He’s a big one, so that’s a bit of a workout! And I do some gardening. I don’t really exercise exercise, if you know what I mean. I don’t go to the gym or anything. Is that bad too? I just like to be active, not… formal about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you're… moderately active. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart… the usual. Then we’ll see what the numbers say. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good. It’s a bit of a climb for these old legs, but I’ll manage. I used to be able to run for miles, you know? But that was a long time ago. Is there a step stool? Just in case.
DOCTOR: There. Now, if you’ll just sit. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Heart sounds… regular, but a bit brisk. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your cholesterol levels. Your total cholesterol is 240, LDL is 160, HDL is 40, and triglycerides are 180. Not ideal, as I suspected. LDL is… quite high.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those numbers… are they bad? I don't understand what any of that means. LDL… that's the bad one, right? The nurse mentioned something about plaque… is that what this is about? I thought I was eating pretty healthy. What does this mean I have to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, LDL is the “bad” cholesterol. It contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries. As for what you have to do... lifestyle changes, primarily. Diet, exercise. Though, given your numbers… and your family history… I think medication is also necessary. A statin. We'll start with a low dose. It's very common.
PATIENT: Medication? Oh. I… I didn't want to take medication. I thought I could fix this with diet and exercise. Are you sure? Is it really necessary? What are the side effects? I've heard bad things about those statin drugs. My neighbor… well, never mind. But… could we try the diet and exercise for a few months first? See if that makes a difference? I really don’t want to start taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Geho, I understand your reluctance, but your numbers are significantly elevated. Waiting could lead to more serious problems. While I appreciate your desire to try lifestyle changes, it’s often not enough, especially in cases like yours. A low-dose statin is quite safe for most people, the risks are minimal. We will monitor your liver enzymes. I’ll prescribe atorvastatin 10mg daily. We’ll recheck your cholesterol in three months. If you absolutely insist on trying diet and exercise first, we can, but I strongly advise against it. Here’s the prescription. Try to follow a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, increase your exercise, and schedule a follow-up appointment in three months. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a lot. Okay. Three months. I guess I can try that. But… what kind of diet exactly? And what kind of exercise? Just walking the dog isn't enough, is it? I’m… I’m not very good with this sort of thing. I wish someone could just tell me exactly what to eat and do. Is there a handout? Or a website? I don’t want to mess this up. I just want to be healthy. And… what are the side effects I should watch out for? My neighbor said something about muscle pain… is that common?
DOCTOR: There are numerous resources online, but honestly, most people find them overwhelming. Here. A very basic outline. Reduce saturated and trans fats, increase fiber, eat more fish. The muscle pain is a potential side effect, but rare with a low dose. If you experience significant muscle weakness or pain, contact me immediately. Honestly, Mrs. Geho, I have other patients waiting. Just follow the handout, take the medication as prescribed, and we’ll see where we are in three months. Do you have any specific questions about the medication itself, or are we done here?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I guess. No, I don't think so. Not right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope this works. I really don’t want to be on medication. I’ll try my best. And… I'll schedule the follow-up appointment. Good day to you.
