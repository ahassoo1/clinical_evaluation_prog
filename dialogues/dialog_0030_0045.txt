DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, my face gets red. A lot. Especially when I eat. It’s… embarrassing, you know? Like a hot flash, but all over. It started a few months ago, maybe six? I don’t remember exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds concerning and can be quite disruptive. About six months ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, around six months. Maybe a little more, maybe a little less. Time… it goes fast, doesn't it? It’s not painful, not at all. Just… warm. And red. My wife… she used to say it looked like a tomato. She would have known what to do.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. It’s understandable that you’re still feeling her loss. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on with the facial redness. So, this redness happens specifically when you eat?
PATIENT: Yes. Mostly when I eat. Spicy food… that’s bad. But even not-so-spicy things sometimes. Like… a sandwich. Or soup. It's strange. And it happens faster some days than others. Yesterday, it was just a few bites of rice and it started. Other days I can eat a whole plate before anything happens. I don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s triggered by eating, but not consistently tied to specific foods. And it seems to vary in how quickly it appears. Does anything else seem to bring it on, besides eating?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. Sometimes when I'm… stressed, maybe? But I don’t get stressed very often. I like quiet. And… no, I can’t think of anything else. No soaps, no lotions, no new clothes… nothing. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. And would you say it’s just your face that gets red, or does the redness spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: Just my face, Doctor. And my neck a little bit, sometimes. But mostly my cheeks. It’s not my chest, not my arms… just my face and maybe a little bit of my neck. Like a blush, but not… happy. It’s not a good blush.
DOCTOR: Okay, face and neck. That helps. Now, let's go through some general health questions. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this redness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No headache, no fever, no… stomach problems. Nothing. Just the red face. And… sometimes a little bit of sweating when it happens. Not a lot, just a little bit more than usual. It’s just the redness, mostly. It’s… annoying. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the redness and occasionally some mild sweating. Have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not now, not ever, really. I don’t take anything. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat good food, get enough rest… well, mostly enough rest. My wife… she always made sure I ate right. I don’t need pills. I just want this redness to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. No current or past medications, and you generally prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much to tell, Doctor. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I had the flu a few times when I was a kid, like everyone. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But… that was a long time ago. No serious illnesses, no hospital stays, nothing like that. I’ve always been… strong. Until this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good health throughout your life, no significant medical problems. And no surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Nothing ever needed fixing, thankfully. Just… a few aches and pains, like everyone gets when they get older. But nothing a little rest couldn’t fix. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I don’t ask for much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Do you have any family history of similar skin issues, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had sensitive skin, I think. She used to get rashes sometimes. But not like this redness. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. But I don’t know if that’s related. We didn’t talk about health much. It wasn’t something we… focused on. I don’t know much about my family’s health history, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. It's common for families not to discuss health extensively. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well… I live alone now, since my wife passed. I used to work as a counselor, helping people with… problems. I retired a few years ago. I like to read, mostly. And… quiet. I don’t go out much. I have a few friends, but we mostly talk on the phone. Nothing exciting. A simple life, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, you're retired, and enjoy quiet activities. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked, never drank, never touched anything like that. Always been… careful. My wife… she wouldn’t have liked it. I take care of myself, Doctor. I always have. Just… this redness is worrying me. It’s new. And I don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. And you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart, and then I’ll take a closer look at your face. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but overall everything sounds good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. And as I examine your face, I see the redness you mentioned. There’s no rash or swelling, just generalized redness. It doesn't appear to be painful to the touch. Now, I'd like to ask you a few more questions as I document these findings. Do you notice this redness worsening after exercise or exposure to sunlight?
PATIENT: No, not really. Exercise… I don’t do much exercise, to be honest. Just a little walking sometimes. And sunlight… I try to stay in the shade, mostly. I don’t like being in the sun. It makes me hot. No, it doesn’t seem to get worse with exercise or sunlight. Just… when I eat. That’s the only thing I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no worsening with exercise or sunlight. And you've consistently mentioned it’s related to eating. This is starting to point towards a few possibilities. One possibility could be rosacea, a common skin condition that causes facial redness, flushing, and sometimes small, visible blood vessels. However, the fact that it started relatively recently and is specifically triggered by eating is a little unusual for typical rosacea. Another possibility could be a reaction to something in your diet, though we haven’t identified anything specific yet. A less common possibility, but something we need to consider, is a condition called flushing syndrome, which can be triggered by certain foods or medications, though you've confirmed you don’t take any medications. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Well… I don’t like needles. But… if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, okay. I trust you, Doctor. Do what you need to do. Just… try to be quick, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Withycombe. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The blood tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for the redness. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and some inflammatory markers. I'll write the order now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. In the meantime, I'd like you to keep a detailed food diary for the next week, noting everything you eat and drink, as well as when the redness occurs and how severe it is. This will help us identify any potential dietary triggers. Would you like me to provide you with a form for the food diary, or would you prefer to use a notebook?
PATIENT: A form would be good, Doctor. I’m not very good at remembering things without writing them down. A form would help me keep it organized. Thank you. Anything to help figure this out.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Just fill it out as accurately as possible for the next week. And don’t hesitate to write down anything you think might be relevant, even if it seems small. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. After the results come back, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if the redness becomes severe or is accompanied by any other symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And… thank you for the form. I’ll do my best to fill it out properly. I just want to feel normal again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I understand. We’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and please take care.
