DOCTOR: Right, Tierney Shaub. 64 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osga, thank you for seeing me. I… I wanted to get tested for HIV. I just thought it was a good idea to check, you know? For peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Peace of mind. Yes, well, everyone's entitled to their anxieties, I suppose. Though, at your age… Honestly. But alright. Have you… had any reason to think you might have been exposed?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. My husband and I… we’ve been together a long time. Very long. And we haven’t… well, we haven’t been with anyone else. But I read an article, and it just made me think… it’s better to be safe than sorry, you know? Especially as I'm getting older. It’s just… a worry at the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: An article, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It was in a magazine, actually. A health magazine my daughter sends me. It talked about how important it is to get tested, even if you don't think you're at risk. And it mentioned that older people sometimes aren't thought of when it comes to things like HIV, but they should still be tested. It got me thinking… maybe I should be tested, just to be sure. Is that… silly?
DOCTOR: Silly is a strong word. Unnecessary, perhaps. But alright. Well, we can do a test. It’s a simple blood draw. Though I must say, given your… circumstances, I find it a bit… excessive. But fine. Let’s get through this. First, though, any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Nothing I've ever needed to worry about. Just the usual… mosquitoes, perhaps! But nothing a bit of repellent can’t handle. And no, I haven't had any reactions to any medications before, as far as I recall. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Medications. Are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: Just a bit of something for my blood pressure, Doctor. A small, white pill. My regular doctor prescribed it, about five years ago now. It's… amlodipine, I think it's called. Just one every morning. And that’s it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine. Fine. And any history of… serious illness?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious, no. I had malaria when I was quite young, back in Nigeria, but I recovered fully. And I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but that’s about it. Oh, and my knees aren't what they used to be, but I think that’s just old age creeping up! Does that count? I also had a bit of a problem with my gall bladder about ten years ago, but they removed it, and I've been fine ever since.
DOCTOR: Right. Malaria, flu, gallbladder. All noted. Family history?
PATIENT: Well, that's a bit complicated, Doctor. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had diabetes. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very involved in their medical care, if I'm honest. They both passed away a while ago now, back in Nigeria. My brother is still alive, though. He lives in Lagos, and as far as I know, he's perfectly healthy. He's a bit older than me. Does that help? It’s a little difficult to remember everything now.
DOCTOR: It's...adequate. Alright. Let's move on. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My husband smoked for a while, but he gave it up years ago. It wasn't agreeing with his chest. We both prefer fresh air, if you know what I mean. And we don't drink much either. Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing heavy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's...information. Do you have any tattoos or piercings?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Goodness, no. Never. I don’t think I’ve ever been tempted. I don’t think they’re very… dignified, to be honest. And I've always been a bit afraid of needles, so getting a tattoo would be out of the question! No, no tattoos or piercings, never. Just my ears, when I was a little girl, but that was a very long time ago. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, alright. Let’s just get this test done. Roll up your sleeve. It’s a simple blood draw, and then we can be finished. It's just… a precaution, you understand. A very unnecessary precaution, in my opinion. But if it will put your mind at ease…
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s all I want. Thank you for doing this for me. It’s good to be sure, you know? Here we go. I do hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I never have been good with needles, as I mentioned. But I appreciate you taking the time to do this for me.
DOCTOR: Nurse, blood draw, please. Standard HIV test. And could you please be quick about it?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I do hope it won’t take long. I have a bit of a… fear of hospitals, you see. And needles. Mostly needles. But I’m trying to be brave.
DOCTOR: Honestly, some people. A complete waste of resources. But fine. Let's just get this over with.
PATIENT: Right. Just… do it quickly, please. I’m not very good with pain, you see. And I do hope everything is… sterile. I’ve heard stories, you know. But I’m sure your nurse is very professional. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Just get it done, quickly and efficiently. And ensure proper protocol is followed. I don’t have all day.
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn’t very pleasant. But… I suppose it’s over now. Thank you. You were very quick. Now what happens?
DOCTOR: The lab will process the sample. It will take approximately one week for the results to come back. My office will contact you. Don't call us. We'll call you. And frankly, I expect a negative result. This entire exercise was… unnecessary. Now, is there anything else, or can I finally finish my paperwork?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you for… seeing me. I’ll wait for your call. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Waste of time. .
