DOCTOR: Alright, Kandy, good morning. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Burlingham. Well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a while. It’s been going on for maybe a week or so now.
DOCTOR: Right. Difficulty starting, takes a while… A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week. Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, it sort of… came on gradually. One day it was just a little harder than usual, and then the next day a little harder still. Nothing painful, just… frustrating. I have to really… push, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Pushing, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. And it doesn’t always come out all at once, if you know what I mean. I have to go a few times. It’s… a nuisance, really. I worry about it, too. Is it something serious, Doctor? I'm a healthy woman, generally. I walk every day, eat my vegetables… mostly.
DOCTOR: Well, Kandy, you're right to get it checked out. It could be nothing, but we need to rule things out. You say you're generally healthy... any previous medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, maybe thirty years ago, but that was it. And the usual things, colds, flu… nothing major. Oh, and my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but I don’t take anything for it. The doctor said to just watch my salt intake. Otherwise, I'm quite sturdy, you know? I haven’t been sick in bed for… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder out thirty years ago… High blood pressure, watching salt… Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Let me think. My mother had… arthritis, badly. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. Not sure exactly what. He didn't like doctors much, so we never knew the details. And my brother, he has diabetes, type 2, I think. Does that matter, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can. Diabetes, arthritis, heart trouble… all useful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I take ibuprofen. But not regularly. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. It’s the blue kind, I think… Advil, is it? I forget the names so easily these days. Nothing else, I promise. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Right. Multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen… Good. Now, let's talk about your bowel habits generally. Have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a bit… personal, isn’t it? Well… no, not really. Everything seems… normal there, if you must know. Regular as clockwork, thankfully. It's just the other end that’s been giving me trouble. I didn't think the two were connected, but… you doctors always ask these things. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Everything is connected, Kandy. It’s important to have the full picture. Alright, good, regular bowel movements. Now, I’m going to need to ask a few questions about your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not even tried it. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. I used to work around people who smoked, when I was younger, but I always stayed away from it myself. And I don't drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion. Nothing more. I prefer tea, actually. Very sensible, you see?
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes. Alright. And do you do any strenuous physical activity aside from your daily walks?
PATIENT: Well, I used to garden a lot. Tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers… but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I still try to potter around a bit, but it’s not like it was. Mostly walking, that’s it. About a mile every day, usually. Sometimes a little more if the weather’s nice. I like to walk to the shops, keeps me active, you see? Keeps me out of trouble, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Kandy, it sounds like you’re generally quite healthy, despite a few aches and pains. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please don’t be too rough with my knees, if you have to bend them. They complain enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen. And then I'll just need to do a quick digital rectal exam. I know it’s not the most comfortable thing, but it's important to rule out any obvious issues. I’ll be as gentle as possible.
PATIENT: Oh. A… digital rectal exam? I see. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just… I’ve never had one before. It sounds… unpleasant. But if it will help me figure out what’s wrong, then… alright. Just… please be quick about it? And explain what you’re doing, if you don’t mind. It would make me feel a bit better.
DOCTOR: It will be quick, Kandy. I’m just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. It's standard procedure. I’ll explain everything as I go. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up. And try to relax. It will be easier if you do. I'll need to use some lubricant first.
PATIENT: Alright… I’m ready, I suppose. But please, be gentle. I really do worry about my knees… and everything else, for that matter. Just… let me know what you’re doing, like you said. It helps to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kandy. I’m just going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It will feel some pressure, but shouldn’t be painful. Just try to relax your muscles. I’m checking the walls of your rectum and the prostate for any lumps or tenderness. I’m also checking the tone of your anal sphincter. Hmm. No obvious masses or tenderness. Tone is normal. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but that's common for someone your age. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now. Lie flat on your back.
PATIENT: Enlarged prostate… Is that… bad, Doctor? Does that mean I have… something serious? I've heard stories… about men and their prostate… But I thought women didn't have… Is it something I should be worried about? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Now, Kandy, let’s not jump to conclusions. A slightly enlarged prostate is very common in women your age, especially after menopause. It’s not necessarily something to be worried about. It can cause some urinary symptoms, like difficulty starting and incomplete emptying, which is what you’ve been experiencing. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms and the size of your prostate. I'm going to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood, which can be elevated in the presence of prostate enlargement or inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Not necessarily surgery… That’s good. Urine analysis and a blood test… How long will that take, Doctor? And what if… what if the blood test is high? What does that mean then? Will I need to see a specialist? I don’t like going to lots of different doctors, you know. It’s all so… confusing. Will it be expensive? I’m on Medicare, but… well, you know how it is. There are always copays and things.
DOCTOR: The tests will take a few days to process. A high PSA level doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, Kandy. It can be elevated due to a number of factors, such as infection, inflammation, or even recent ejaculation. We'll need to repeat the test to confirm the results. If the results are consistently elevated, we may need to refer you to a urologist for further evaluation, such as a prostate biopsy. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll take things one step at a time. The urine analysis and PSA test are both covered by Medicare, so you shouldn't have any out-of-pocket expenses beyond your standard copay. I’ll send the orders to the lab now. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. Here's the lab order. And I'm going to prescribe you an alpha-blocker medication to help relax the muscles in your bladder and prostate. It may help improve your urinary symptoms while we wait for the test results.
PATIENT: An alpha-blocker… Will that have any side effects, Doctor? I’ve heard stories about medications… making you dizzy or… things like that. I don’t want to fall, you know. I live alone. And if I do need to see a urologist… what would they do? Would it be… painful? I really don’t like hospitals or… procedures. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s… reassuring, I think. But I’m still worried.
DOCTOR: The alpha-blocker medication can cause some side effects, such as dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when you first start taking it. It's important to take it at bedtime, and to rise slowly from a sitting or lying position. If you experience any significant side effects, stop taking the medication and contact me. If we do need to refer you to a urologist, they'll perform a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of your symptoms. That may include a digital rectal exam, a urine flow study, and possibly an ultrasound. If a biopsy is necessary, it's generally a minimally invasive procedure and is performed under local anesthesia. It may cause some mild discomfort or bleeding, but it's generally well-tolerated. Now, let’s not worry about things that may never happen. We’ll take things one step at a time, as I said. Start taking the alpha-blocker medication tonight, and schedule the lab tests as soon as possible. Then, we’ll see what the results show. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. I just… I’ll try to stay positive. And I’ll take the medication, and schedule the tests. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your time. And your patience.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Kandy. And don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
