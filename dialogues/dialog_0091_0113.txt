DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes, good morning to you too, Doctor... Delacour, was it? Seems like I'm always running to the bathroom these days. It's… well, it’s just annoying, really. More than anything. I don’t feel sick, you understand. Just… frequent. My wife, bless her heart, says I should get it checked. Women and their worries!
DOCTOR: I see. Frequent urination, and you don’t otherwise feel unwell. It’s good that your wife encouraged you to come in – it’s always wise to investigate changes in bodily functions. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this frequency?
PATIENT: Changes, eh? Well, I suppose everything changes eventually. I… honestly, it’s hard to say when it started exactly. A few months, maybe? It's not a sudden thing. It's just… more trips than there used to be. Used to be able to go a whole afternoon without thinking about it, now... now it's every couple of hours, sometimes less. And it’s not like I’m drinking gallons of water either. I have my usual coffee in the morning, maybe a glass or two with lunch… nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual increase in frequency over the past few months, without a significant change in your fluid intake. And you mentioned coffee – does it seem to worsen the issue, or is it consistent regardless of what you drink?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. Coffee doesn't seem to make it worse, not that I’ve noticed. It just… is. Look, I've lived a long life, Doctor. Probably just an old man thing, you know? These things happen. I'm more concerned with the garden than my bladder, if you catch my drift. Although, running back and forth to the garden… well, that is a bit of a nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Segretto, and I appreciate you sharing that. However, even seemingly minor changes can sometimes indicate an underlying issue that’s best addressed. It’s good that you are proactive about your health. To get a clearer picture, could you describe how you're urinating when you go?
PATIENT: How am I urinating…? Now that’s a question. I… I go to the bathroom, Doctor. Like a normal person. What do you want me to say? It's... a stream, I suppose. Normal stream. Not straining, not painful… just… frequent, as I said. Look, I’m a farmer, I don’t spend my time analyzing the particulars of my… bodily functions! Is something wrong with the stream? You're starting to worry me now.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem… detailed, Mr. Segretto. I’m simply trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what's going on. It's good to hear you’re not experiencing pain or difficulty. When you urinate, do you feel like you are completely emptying your bladder, or do you feel a lingering sensation that you haven’t finished?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a… good question, actually. Now that you mention it… I think I do. Most of the time. But sometimes… sometimes I feel like there’s a little bit left. Just a little. Not enough to bother running back right away, but… I notice it later. When I get the urge again. It’s… subtle, you understand? It's not like a full bladder, just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A feeling of incomplete emptying occasionally. That's helpful information. Now, let’s broaden the picture a bit. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. My knees ache more these days, that's for sure. But that's just old age creeping up on me. And my memory isn't what it used to be, but who needs to remember everything? My wife does all the remembering, thank goodness. Other than that… I suppose not. I eat about the same, sleep about the same, work in the garden… it's all fairly routine. Oh! The tomatoes are doing wonderfully this year. Best crop I've had in ages. Is that the kind of change you mean?
DOCTOR: The tomatoes sound excellent. That’s wonderful to hear. I was more referring to changes in your overall health – any fever, chills, weight loss, fatigue, or changes in your bowel habits, for example?
PATIENT: No, no fevers or chills. I haven’t lost any weight, if anything I’m carrying a bit too much these days. And I’m not tired, not any more than usual. I'm a farmer, Doctor. I’m always tired! And my… bowel habits? Oh, goodness. Must you ask about everything? They’re… regular enough. Let’s just leave it at that, shall we? This is all a bit… intrusive, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: You are right to voice your concerns, Mr. Segretto. I apologize if I’m being too intrusive. I assure you, I’m asking these questions to gather a complete picture of your health and rule out any potential issues. To continue, do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I get a bit of a sniffle when the pollen is bad, but everyone does. And I’m not allergic to anything I know of… haven’t ever had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife gave me some pills once for my knees, but I stopped taking them, didn’t seem to do much good. Didn't cause any problems either, so I didn't bother asking about them.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned those pills for your knees—do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tricky one. My wife handles all the medication. She's very organized, you see. I think… it was a white pill? Small, round, I believe. Maybe it started with an "N"? No, that doesn't sound right. I really have no idea, Doctor. She keeps a list, I'm sure, but I wouldn't know where to find it. Honestly, I just take what she gives me. It's easier that way.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can certainly try to track down the information later, if necessary. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I take a little… multi-vitamin, I suppose. My wife insists. And sometimes, when my joints are really bothering me, she gives me something for the pain. Again, I don’t know the name of it. She says it's safe. Honestly, I mostly just drink coffee and work in the garden. Is that allowed?
DOCTOR: Coffee and gardening are perfectly allowed, Mr. Segretto. It sounds like you have a good routine. Given your symptoms and your medical history, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also want to check a urine sample to rule out any infection or other issues. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical examination, eh? Well… I suppose so. It's not ideal, but if you think it's necessary. Just don't poke around too much, alright? My wife will have my hide if I come home with bruises. And the urine sample… where exactly am I supposed to… collect that? Do you have a… facility?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I'll be as gentle as possible. And yes, we do have a private restroom right down the hall. There are instructions and collection cups available. Please just collect a mid-stream sample - that means starting to urinate and then collecting a portion of the urine mid-way through. I’ll let you have some privacy, and I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Shall we start with listening to your abdomen?
PATIENT: Abdomen, eh? Alright, go ahead. I warn you, I had a rather large lunch. Might be some rumbling. I ate a particularly good tomato sandwich. And don’t be alarmed if you hear my knees creak. They always complain when I bend over. Just do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you know what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I'm listening now. Everything sounds… normal. No signs of tenderness or distention. I do hear some bowel sounds, which is good – it indicates your digestive system is functioning. I also notice… a slightly enlarged prostate upon palpation. It’s not dramatically enlarged, but it is something I’ll take into consideration with your symptoms. Now, could you please proceed to the restroom to collect a urine sample when you are ready?
PATIENT: Enlarged… what was it? Prostrate? Oh dear. Is that bad? My wife never mentioned anything about my prostrate. Is that something serious? You're starting to worry me again, Doctor. I told you I just have an old man thing! Alright, alright. Fine. I'll go collect your sample. But don't go scaring me with talk of enlarged… things. And try to explain what all this means when I get back.
DOCTOR: Please don't worry, Mr. Segretto. An enlarged prostate is quite common as men age – it’s not necessarily serious, but it can cause urinary symptoms like increased frequency and difficulty emptying the bladder. That's why I’d like to analyze your urine sample and consider a prostate-specific antigen test to get a clearer picture. We’ll discuss all the results and potential options once we have them. For now, just focus on collecting the sample. There's no need to be alarmed. We're simply gathering information. I’ll be right here when you return.
PATIENT: A test, eh? More tests. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a science experiment. Alright, alright. I'll go collect your sample. But if I come back with a headache from all the worrying, you’re buying me a nice slice of tomato pie. Tomato pie… that's what I need. And maybe a strong cup of coffee. A very strong cup of coffee. .
