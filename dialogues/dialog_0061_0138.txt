DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Alayne! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Dr. Kimm, you said? Well, it’s a bit… hard to explain. Things haven't been quite right lately, and my daughter, bless her heart, she insisted I come in. Something about… weakness on one side? And there’s been headaches, but honestly, my memory… it's not what it used to be. My mother had terrible headaches too, though. Horrible ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Alayne. It is hard to explain sometimes, and it’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. We’ll take our time and figure things out. So, this weakness – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it comes and goes, you see? It’s mostly on my left side, I think. My arm feels… heavy sometimes. And my leg… a little clumsy. It doesn't happen all the time, just… episodes, my daughter calls them. It’s hard to describe. It’s not constant, thank goodness. Like it fades in and out, you know? I’ll be walking along, and then suddenly… a bit unsteady. Then it’s gone. It's been happening more often lately, though, that's why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, episodes of weakness on your left side, coming and going. And it’s been happening more frequently recently. That's helpful to know. Now, these headaches… can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… they're not always bad, you understand. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, behind my eyes. But other times… oh, other times they’re awful. A throbbing pain, like a tight band around my head. And sometimes I feel a little nauseous with them, but I haven't actually been sick, if that makes sense. They can last for hours… or just a few minutes. Like the weakness, it’s very unpredictable. And, honestly, my mother… she suffered with migraines all her life. Terrible, debilitating things. I don’t know if it’s the same, but… it worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, especially with your mother’s history. It’s good you’re mentioning that. So, we have these episodes of weakness on your left side, and these headaches that vary in intensity – sometimes a dull ache, sometimes throbbing, and occasionally with nausea. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes lately – anything at all, even if it doesn't seem related?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my vision… sometimes it gets a little blurry, but I always thought it was just my eyes getting older. I have to hold things further away to read now, you see. And… oh dear. This is hard. Sometimes I stumble over my words a little. Just a little. Nothing major, but my daughter has noticed it. She's very observant, that one. She keeps telling me I need to slow down, but I'm always so busy! And… no, I don't think that's anything else. Just getting old, probably. It's hard to say, really. My memory… it’s not what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, some difficulty finding the right words, and your daughter has noticed some changes in your speech. And you’ve mentioned memory concerns. Thank you for sharing all of that, Alayne. It gives me a much clearer picture. Now, let's go through some of the usual questions. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so he put me on a little pill for it. I take that every morning. Other than that… no, I don't think so. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? I’ve never been a sickly person, thankfully. Nothing serious, ever. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old. And I get regular check-ups with Dr. Henderson, but he always said I was a pretty healthy lady, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some arthritis in your knees. It’s good you’ve been seeing Dr. Henderson regularly. And have you ever had any surgeries, Alayne?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Must have been… goodness, forty years ago? More than that, maybe. And I had a hysterectomy, I suppose. Years and years ago. Other than those two… no, I don’t think so. Nothing else. Just the usual bumps and bruises, nothing major. Honestly, my memory is just… a fog sometimes. It's hard to keep track of everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy, both some time ago. Thank you. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of stroke, heart disease, or neurological problems – like dementia or Parkinson’s – in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Well… my mother, like I said, suffered with terrible migraines all her life. And her sister… Aunt Rose… she had a stroke, I think. Yes, a stroke. It left her a little… weak on one side, like me. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was young, so I don't remember a lot of details. And… I think one of my cousins… a distant cousin… had something with his memory, but I don't know what it was. Honestly, my family… it’s a big family, and I don’t keep track of everyone’s ailments. It's hard to remember, you know? But yes, there was some of that, I think. Aunt Rose’s stroke, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of migraines, a stroke in your Aunt Rose, and heart problems in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, I don't smoke. Never have. My husband, bless his soul, he used to smoke a pipe, but he gave that up years ago. And I don't drink much alcohol. Just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular, I assure you. I always thought it was best to be moderate. My mother always said moderation is the key to a long life, and she lived to be ninety, so I always tried to follow her advice.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and only a little alcohol occasionally. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, I don't think so. I've never had any trouble with medications before. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I take penicillin, but it’s not a full-blown allergy, just a little irritation. Other than that… no, I don't have any allergies. I’m pretty lucky, really. I’ve always been a healthy lady, all things considered. It's just… this weakness, and the headaches… that's what worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne, thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a really good understanding of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It will just take a few minutes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I know you’re just trying to help. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. We’ll take things slowly and gently. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your strength and reflexes. Okay, follow my finger with your eyes. Good. Now, squeeze my hands. Your grip is good on the right, a little weaker on the left. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit brisk on both sides, but normal. Now, I'm going to check your balance and coordination. Can you stand up for me, if you’re comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can stand up. Just a little wobbly, you know. My knees… they aren’t what they used to be. And I sometimes get a little dizzy when I stand up too quickly. But I'm standing! Just… be careful with me, dear. I don't want to fall! This is all a bit nerve-wracking, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. We'll be very careful. And it's perfectly alright to hold onto the chair. You are a little unsteady, and there is some mild swaying. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just a few steps. One… two… three… Oh dear… I feel a little off balance. Just a little. I think it’s my knees, honestly. It’s hard to know where to put them sometimes. My daughter says I’m shuffling, but I don’t notice it myself. It’s just… getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Alayne. Take your time. You're doing fine. You have a slightly shuffling gait on the left side, and there is some mild difficulty with balance. Okay, thank you, Alayne. That's all I need for now. Please, sit back down. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about possible neurological issues. Your symptoms – the weakness, headaches, blurry vision, difficulty with speech, and changes in your gait – along with the findings on the exam, suggest we need to investigate further. I want to order some imaging of your brain – an MRI – to get a better look and rule out any serious problems, such as a stroke or tumor. I'll also order some blood tests to check for any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI? And blood tests? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? My mother… she never had an MRI. She just had headaches, and the doctor gave her pills. But you said something about a stroke? And a tumor? I’m not sure I understand. Will it hurt? I don’t like needles. And what if it is bad? What then? I just want to know what’s going on, but I’m so scared…
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Alayne, and it’s perfectly natural to feel scared. It’s good that we’re taking these steps to find out what’s going on. Let me explain. An MRI is a painless imaging test that uses magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the inside of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it doesn't hurt at all. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will take about 30-45 minutes. The reason I want to do the MRI is to rule out a few things. A stroke is when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, and it can cause weakness, headaches, and other symptoms. A tumor is a growth in the brain, and it can also cause similar symptoms. But it’s important to remember that there are many other possible causes for your symptoms, and most of them are not serious. The blood tests will help me check for things like vitamin deficiencies, infections, or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We need to get this information before we can make a diagnosis and figure out the best treatment plan. It’s better to know what’s going on so we can take care of it. I’ll explain everything in detail once we have the results of the tests. And I’ll be here to answer any questions you have. Do you feel comfortable with me ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s best. And if it will help me find out what’s going on… then yes, go ahead. But please, explain everything to me afterwards. I don't understand all the medical terms. And I get so anxious… I need someone to hold my hand, maybe? And what if the machine is loud? My daughter said something about claustrophobia… I get a little… panicky in small spaces. And will the doctor call me with the results? Or will I have to come back? It’s just… a lot to take in, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. We'll take everything one step at a time. And I completely understand your concerns. Yes, absolutely, I will explain everything in detail afterwards, using plain language. No medical jargon, I promise. And you can bring your daughter with you, if you like, she can help you with the information. You can definitely hold my hand during the tests, if it helps. The machine is a bit loud, it makes a knocking sound, but we can give you earplugs or headphones to help block it out. And if you’re feeling claustrophobic, you can close your eyes, and we can talk to you through a microphone. If it becomes too much, we can stop the test at any time. We'll schedule the MRI for as soon as possible. I’ll give you some instructions on how to prepare for it. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available. Then, we will schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss them in detail. I want you to know that I'm here to support you through this process. You're not alone. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little better. Knowing I can stop it if I get scared helps. And having my daughter with me… yes, that would be good. She’s very good at remembering things, you see. Let me see… what was the name of the test again? MRI? And will it show… everything? Will it show if something is wrong with my brain? And what if… what if it is something bad? I don't want to be a burden to my family… And one more thing… can I still drive after the test? I have to pick up my grandson from school… It’s just… a lot to worry about, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, the test is called an MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It’s a very good imaging test, and it will give us a detailed look at your brain. It will help us see if there are any abnormalities, such as signs of a stroke, tumor, or other problems. I understand your worry about what if it is something bad. It’s natural to have those fears. But remember, we don’t know anything yet. And even if we find something, there are often treatments available. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll make the best decisions for you. And you won’t be a burden to your family, Alayne. They love you, and they want to help. Regarding driving after the test, yes, you should be able to drive. However, some people feel a little tired or dizzy afterwards. So, if you feel unwell, please ask someone else to drive you. It’s also best to avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day. I’m going to have my nurse, Maria, schedule the MRI for you. She’ll also give you some written instructions on how to prepare for the test. Do you have any other questions for me right now, before she comes in?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That’s good about driving. My grandson… he’s counting on me. No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please, explain everything to me afterwards, in plain language. And let my daughter come with me. She’s very good at taking notes. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with me. It’s just… hard, you know? Getting old… things start to go wrong. I’m glad I came in. Even if it is scary.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alayne. And you absolutely did the right thing by coming in. It’s always better to get things checked out. And don’t worry, I promise to explain everything in plain language, and your daughter is more than welcome to come with you and take notes. Maria will be in shortly to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. I just… I’ll be thinking about the test, I suppose. And hoping for the best. Thank you again for being so kind. I think I’ll just sit here for a moment and gather my thoughts.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. Take all the time you need. And please, don’t hesitate to let me or Maria know if you have any questions or concerns before the test. We'll take good care of you.
