DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, welcome. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It’s…Ellan Rannells. I received a flyer, you see, regarding…medical marijuana. My husband, bless his soul, thought it might be…worth looking into. Though I must say, I have my reservations.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I understand. You received a flyer about medical marijuana and are considering it, but have some concerns. That's perfectly reasonable. We can absolutely discuss that, and whether it might be a good option for you. To get started, can you tell me a little bit about what you’re hoping to get relief from?
PATIENT: Relief? Oh. Well, it’s not as though I’m suffering, Doctor. It’s just…getting older is hardly a picnic, is it? The joints ache, particularly when the weather turns. And sleep…sleep isn't what it once was. It’s more of an…interruption of discomfort, if you follow. Though I don't expect miracles, naturally.
DOCTOR: I do follow, Ellan. It sounds like you're experiencing some typical aches and pains with age, and some trouble sleeping. That’s common, and very frustrating. So, the joint pain is worse with weather changes, and you’d describe your sleep as interrupted?
PATIENT: “Interrupted” is…a kind way of putting it, Doctor. It’s more like a constant battle against…restlessness. And the aches…they’re not just any aches, you understand. They're…a deep-seated discomfort. My husband keeps saying I should try these new supplements, but frankly, I've always preferred a good cup of chamomile tea. More reliable, I find.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been a persistent issue, and you've already tried some things to manage it. Chamomile tea is a good start! And it's good you're cautious about trying new things. Before we discuss medical marijuana further, let's get a little more detail. Could you tell me where exactly are you experiencing the joint pain?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, Doctor, practically. But mostly…the knees, naturally. And the hips. And sometimes, the lower back. It’s…the price one pays for a life well-lived, I suppose. Though it doesn't make it any more pleasant, does it? I used to be quite the dancer, you know. A very good dancer. Not anymore, sadly.
DOCTOR: I see. So knees, hips, and lower back are the primary areas of pain. And you used to be a dancer – that’s wonderful! It sounds like this pain is impacting your ability to do things you enjoy. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your pain is on average?
PATIENT: A scale, you say? Hmm. Well, it certainly isn’t a ten, Doctor. I’m not incapacitated, you understand. But it’s not a nothing, either. On most days…I’d say a…a solid four. Perhaps a five on a particularly damp day. It’s…persistent, that’s what it is. Always there, nagging away. It interferes with…everything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four to five, increasing on damp days. That's helpful. And you mentioned it interferes with everything. Can you give me a few examples of things it makes difficult?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, must I? It makes…gardening rather unpleasant, for one. And keeping up with the grandchildren is…challenging. One can't simply play when one is feeling discomfort, can one? And even simple things, like…walking the dog. It’s…undignified, really, to be hobbling along. A proper lady should be able to maintain a certain…grace.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ellan. Those all sound like things you enjoy and want to continue doing. It’s frustrating when pain limits you like that. Now, besides the pain and trouble sleeping, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… my husband says I’m a bit more…irritable than I used to be. But honestly, Doctor, that’s hardly a symptom. It’s just…life is more aggravating these days, isn't it? Everything is…a bother. And I do find myself…forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, for instance. Or a name. But I wouldn't call it a symptom. Just…a natural decline, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased irritability and some minor forgetfulness. It's good you're aware of those changes. Those can sometimes be related to other things, so it’s good to mention them. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that a doctor has diagnosed, like arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, at my age? A few things, naturally. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor warned me about salt, you know. And…well, a touch of arthritis in the hands. Not serious, mind you. Just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. Nothing a good cup of tea can’t fix. And I had a hysterectomy many years ago. That was…unpleasant, but hardly relevant now, is it? I've always been quite…robust, generally. Never been one for complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, some arthritis in the hands, and a hysterectomy in the past. Good to know. Do you take any medications regularly for your high blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes. Just one. Amlodipine, I believe it’s called. Five milligrams, once a day. And…sometimes, a little ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it’s particularly bad. But not often, you understand. I prefer to avoid those things if possible. They upset my stomach. And honestly, Doctor, they don't really do much, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5mg daily for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, not that I recall. Perhaps a little…indigestion sometimes, but hardly an allergy, is it? My husband is the one with the sensitivities, always complaining about dust and pollen. Not me, thank goodness. I have a fairly strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And that's good to know about your husband. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Doctor, really. I assure you, I lead a very respectable life. Smoking? Absolutely not. Alcohol? Perhaps a glass of sherry on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? The very idea! My husband and I believe in moderation, and a good, clean living. We are pillars of the community, you understand. I can't imagine what prompted such a question.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. I ask those questions of all my patients as part of a standard assessment. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother lived to be eighty-seven, a very robust woman. She had a bit of arthritis, like me, but otherwise, quite healthy. My father…he passed away at sixty-two, a heart attack, sadly. And my brother… he's still living, thankfully, but he has diabetes. That’s about it, really. Not a lot of serious illnesses on either side of the family. Mostly just…the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had arthritis and lived to 87, your father passed away from a heart attack at 62, and your brother has diabetes. And you mentioned you used to be a dancer. Do you still do any physical activity now?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Not like I used to, naturally. My dancing days are long behind me. My knees simply wouldn’t allow it. I enjoy a gentle walk in the garden, weather permitting. And I do a bit of light housework, of course. But nothing strenuous, you understand. Mostly I enjoy…reading. And spending time with my grandchildren. That’s exercise enough, I assure you. All that chasing about… it’s quite exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Okay, Ellan, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, before we talk about medical marijuana, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. But please, be gentle. My joints aren’t what they used to be, you understand. And I do dislike being prodded and poked. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I've already told you everything, haven't I?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ellan. It's just a quick check of your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and a look at your joints. It helps me make the best recommendation for you. It will be gentle, I promise. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But do hurry, please. I have a luncheon appointment later, and I wouldn’t want to be late. And please, be careful not to pull on my arm. It’s rather delicate, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your arm. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s just take a look at your knees and hips. Can you bend them for me, just as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s not very comfortable, Doctor. As you can see… they’re not as flexible as they once were. And there’s a bit of creaking. My husband says it sounds like a rusty hinge. It’s quite embarrassing, really. Please, don’t push me too hard. I don’t want to…seize up.
DOCTOR: I see. There's some tenderness on the inner part of both knees and a slight limitation in range of motion. No swelling or redness. The hips have some crepitus as well, which is common with age. Alright, that's enough of the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing typical osteoarthritis, likely aggravated by age and activity. It's also not surprising you have some trouble sleeping with the discomfort. Now, regarding medical marijuana… It could potentially help with both the pain and sleep. However, there are risks and side effects to consider, and it's not right for everyone. Do you have any particular concerns about medical marijuana?
PATIENT: Concerns? Oh, several, Doctor. Honestly, it all sounds a bit… disreputable, doesn’t it? I mean, I've always been a law-abiding citizen. And the side effects…I’ve heard stories, you know. About people becoming…giddy. Or forgetful. And I certainly don't want to be driving around in that state. I’ve also read it can affect one’s…mental clarity. And I need my wits about me, you understand. It just doesn't seem… proper. My husband is the one who suggested it, of course. He’s always been a bit of a…daredevil. But frankly, I’m very hesitant.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ellan. It's good you're thinking carefully about this. It's true, there are potential side effects. Some people experience dizziness, drowsiness, and, as you mentioned, some cognitive effects. However, these side effects are often manageable with a low dose and careful monitoring. It's also important to note that not everyone experiences these side effects. And it’s perfectly safe for use if used appropriately and responsibly, of course you would not drive under the influence. We would start with a very low dose, and gradually increase it until we find a level that provides relief without causing unwanted side effects. We would also discuss potential interactions with your Amlodipine. Before we proceed any further, do you have any questions for me about medical marijuana, or perhaps any concerns I haven’t addressed?
PATIENT: Interactions with my Amlodipine, you say? That is concerning. I wouldn’t want to risk my blood pressure getting too low. And what about…the legality of it all? I wouldn’t want to get into trouble with the authorities. My husband assures me it’s perfectly legal now, but one never knows, does one? And what exactly would I be taking? A pill? An oil? A…vape? The thought of smoking anything is quite abhorrent, you understand. Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds rather complicated and…unsettling. Perhaps I should just stick to chamomile tea. It’s much more reliable, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ellan. I understand your hesitation. Let's address them one by one. Regarding interactions, yes, we would need to be careful about potential interactions with your Amlodipine, though they are generally minimal. We would monitor your blood pressure closely. And yes, medical marijuana is legal in this state with a physician's recommendation. I would be providing that recommendation, and we'd follow all regulations. As for the method of delivery, there are several options. Pills are available, but some people find they aren't as effective. Oils are often taken sublingually – under the tongue – and can provide faster relief. And yes, vaping is an option, but as you mentioned, many people prefer to avoid smoking. We could start with an oil, and you wouldn’t be inhaling anything. It's completely up to you whether you want to try it, Ellan. It's not the right choice for everyone. If you’re more comfortable sticking with chamomile tea, that's perfectly fine. If you are interested in giving it a try, I can give you a referral to a dispensary, and a plan to try a low dose oil. Is this something you would like?
PATIENT: A referral to a dispensary, you say? And a plan…for a low dose oil? Oh dear. It all sounds rather…experimental, doesn’t it? My husband… he’s always been one for trying new things. Perhaps…perhaps I could just think about it for a bit? Talk it over with him? I don’t want to make any rash decisions. It’s a big step, you understand. And I really must get home for luncheon. Perhaps… could you just give me the referral information? And I’ll…consider it. No promises, you understand. Just…information.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. That’s perfectly reasonable. No pressure at all. Here's the information for a reputable local dispensary. They are very knowledgeable and can answer any questions you may have. They can also help you choose a product that’s right for you. And here's a plan I commonly use for first-time patients with similar conditions. It outlines a very low starting dose and how to gradually increase it, if needed. Take your time, talk it over with your husband, and feel free to call my office if you have any questions. If you decide it's not for you, that's perfectly fine. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Thank you… for your patience. And for explaining everything so thoroughly. I still have my reservations, you understand. But it’s… helpful to have the information. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. Luncheon awaits. Good day to you, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Enjoy your luncheon! And please, don't hesitate to call if you change your mind.
