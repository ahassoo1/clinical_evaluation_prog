DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Thanks for having me. It's… well, my muscles feel really weak. It’s been getting worse for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to make things difficult. Just… generally weak, you know? Not like a specific injury or anything.
DOCTOR: I see. "Generally weak," you say. And this has been progressing over the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Started maybe a month ago, and it's… slow, but noticeable. Like, I used to be able to lift boxes no problem at work – insurance appraisals, lots of bending and moving stuff – but now… even carrying a lighter load feels like a struggle. It’s frustrating, honestly. It doesn’t really hurt, just… gives out.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s concerning when your body isn’t performing as it should. So, it's a progressive weakness, without any specific injury to point to. And you mentioned it's impacting your work – lifting and moving boxes. Are you noticing this weakness in other areas of your life, besides work?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. At home, even things like getting out of a chair… takes more effort than it used to. And walking upstairs? Forget about it. I get winded easily, and my legs feel like jelly after a little bit. It's… a little scary, to be honest. I don't even know what is causing it.
DOCTOR: I can certainly appreciate your concern, Mr. McKinnon. It's good you're getting this checked out. To help me get a clearer picture of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit more about how the weakness presents?
PATIENT: How it presents… Hmm. It's not like a sudden thing, like a pulled muscle. It’s more… a general lack of power, I guess? Like my muscles just don’t have the strength they used to. It’s all over, really – arms, legs, even my grip feels weaker. And it's worse when I've been using them for a bit, like if I’m carrying something for a few minutes, it just… fades. It doesn’t come and go, it’s just… always there, at a different level.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent, generalized weakness that worsens with use. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about some other symptoms, just to rule things in or out. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… Actually, yeah, now that you mention it, I haven’t been eating as much. Not because I’m sick, just… don’t feel as hungry. And when I do eat, it doesn’t really give me much energy, you know? It's like… fuel isn’t sticking. It’s not a huge change, but I’ve definitely noticed it. I haven’t lost any weight or anything, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. A decreased appetite and feeling of low energy despite eating are important details. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, and definitely no night sweats. I haven't been feeling sick, like a cold or the flu. It's just… this weakness. It's really the only thing. It’s just… unnerving, because I can’t put my finger on what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And to continue gathering information, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder function recently?
PATIENT: No changes there, Doctor. Everything's… regular, if you don’t mind me saying. No problems with going to the bathroom, or anything like that. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little silly listing off everything that isn’t wrong, but I want to be thorough. This weakness is just… a strange thing, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Mr. McKinnon. It's important to rule things out, and you're being very helpful by providing this information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but nothing that ever required long-term treatment. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so confusing. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I haven’t even been to a doctor in… well, a long time, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries or hospital stays. Never needed them. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, nothing serious enough for a doctor's visit. I really don't like hospitals. It’s just… not my thing. This weakness is the first real health problem I’ve ever had that’s worried me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My dad… he had some heart trouble later in life, but he lived to be 78, so it wasn't too bad. My mom… she had arthritis, but that was when she was older too. Nothing really… significant that runs in the family, as far as I know. No early deaths, no genetic conditions, nothing like that. It's all pretty standard, I think. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. And finally, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No to all of those, Doctor. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple a week, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. I work as an insurance appraiser, so I need to keep a clear head. It’s just… a pretty normal lifestyle, I guess. Nothing out of the ordinary. I spend most of my time working, or relaxing at home. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. McKinnon. Thank you for providing me with such a detailed history. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. I just want to figure out what's going on, so let’s get it done. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. This has been weighing on my mind for a while now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here, please. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your strength and reflexes. It shouldn't take long. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. There you go. Is that okay? It feels… a little weaker than usual, but I’m trying.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Now, let’s check your other arm. And that feels…similar to the other side. Now, I'm going to check your leg strength. Could you try to push your foot against my hand, like you're trying to push against a gas pedal?
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? It feels… harder than it should be. Like I’m really having to concentrate just to do it. It's not a smooth push, if that makes sense. Kind of jerky.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. It is slightly weaker than expected, and there is a bit of difficulty maintaining consistent pressure. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished, bilaterally. And I notice a little bit of muscle atrophy, meaning some loss of muscle mass, in your calves and thighs, although it's subtle. Overall, the physical exam findings are consistent with generalized weakness, slightly diminished reflexes, and some subtle muscle atrophy. Now, to help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. It's… frustrating, not knowing what's going on. I just want to figure it out, so let’s do whatever tests we need to do. And thank you for… not dismissing it, you know? A lot of people would just tell me to rest, but you’re actually listening. That means a lot.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. It's my job to listen and investigate, and your concerns are valid. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , thyroid stimulating hormone , vitamin D level, and creatine kinase level. The CBC will check for any signs of infection or anemia. The CMP will assess your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. The TSH will check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause weakness. The vitamin D level will check for vitamin D deficiency, which is also a common cause of weakness. And the CK level will check for muscle damage. The lab results should be back in a few days. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You explained everything really clearly. Just… try to avoid strenuous activity and rest, and wait for the call. Sounds good. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me and not brushing it off. It's a relief to finally be doing something about it. I appreciate it. And just… how long will the call take? If you need me to schedule a follow-up appointment, I'm flexible. I'm a little worried about how long this is going to take.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I understand your worry, and I'll do my best to expedite the results. The lab usually takes 3-5 business days to return the results, so I anticipate calling you sometime next week. I'll review the results carefully, and if anything concerning comes up, I’ll definitely want to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in more detail and potentially order further testing. For now, let’s wait for the results. To be on the safe side, and given your gradual onset of weakness, if you experience any difficulty breathing, changes in vision, or develop a fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions before we conclude today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Breathing trouble, vision changes, fever… okay, I’ll remember that. It’s… a lot to take in, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. Thank you again. And if you could just let me know when I can expect the call… that would be great. I’m a little anxious about it, to be honest, but I trust your judgment. Thank you. I think that’s everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I understand your anxiety, and I will absolutely let you know as soon as I have the results. I’ll make a note to call you directly. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before my call. Take care, and get some rest. .
