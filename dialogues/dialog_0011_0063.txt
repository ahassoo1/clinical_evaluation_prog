DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Larin. It's nice to meet you too. Um... my back. It's been really bad. Really, really bad pain. It started a little while ago, but now... now I can barely move some days. It’s… well, it hurts a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand, Larin. Back pain can be incredibly debilitating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this pain?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s mostly in my lower back, right here… It feels like… like something is stuck, maybe? Or really tight. Sometimes it shoots down my leg, too, the left one. Not all the time, but when it does, oof. It makes me want to just sit down. I had some tests before, a long time ago… because of… other things. They told me about… something being there. But I don’t remember everything, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Larin. That's helpful. You mentioned pain radiating down your left leg—does that pain feel like a sharp, shooting sensation, or more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: It's more of a… sharp, but it doesn’t last long. Like a quick zap, then it’s gone. But it’s scary when it happens. Makes me jump. And sometimes…sometimes my foot feels kinda numb, too. Not all the time, just… sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It's just… not right.
DOCTOR: I understand. A “zap” of pain radiating down the leg, accompanied by occasional numbness in the foot. That gives me some more information to work with. You also mentioned having some tests done previously. Do you recall when those tests were performed, and what the results indicated, even if it’s just a general idea?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… oh, goodness… about two years ago, I think? Maybe a little more. The doctor… Dr. Alisa… she said something about… a spot. On my… spine. She said it was… cancer. That’s what she said. I had some scans, and… they showed something. I was so scared, I don’t really remember the details. She sent me to another doctor for… more things. But I haven't been back since. It just... it was too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Larin. That must have been incredibly difficult to process. It’s understandable that you haven’t returned for follow-up, given how overwhelming that experience was. To get a clearer picture of what's happening now, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. First, have you had any other medical conditions or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Just… the usual stuff, you know? Colds, flu. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t had any big surgeries or anything like that. Just… this. And… the tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgeries or other major medical conditions. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mama, she passed away a few years back. She had… heart trouble. And my brother, he has… high blood pressure, I think. Nothing really like… this. No one in my family ever had… what I have. That’s why it was such a shock.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Larin. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little about your daily activities?
PATIENT: Well… I work at the factory, you know? I help put things together on the line. It’s… it’s not easy work, standing all day. But I need the job. Before this back got so bad, I was okay. Now… now I have to take a lot of breaks. And even then, it hurts. At home… I mostly just sit. I used to like to garden, but I can’t bend over anymore. It’s hard to do much of anything, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your work involves prolonged standing, and your back pain is significantly impacting your ability to perform your job and enjoy your hobbies. To help me better understand the nature of your pain, are there any specific movements or positions that make it worse, or that provide some relief?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things make it worse. Bending over is terrible. Lifting anything… forget it. Even twisting to look behind me is bad. Sitting for too long isn’t good either, gets really stiff. Relief… hmm. Laying down flat helps a little. And… when I take the pain pills, they help some. But I don’t like taking them all the time. Makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Larin. That’s very helpful. And you mentioned pain pills – what specifically are you taking for the pain, and how often do you take them?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. It's… Percocet. The doctor… Dr. Alisa… she gave it to me. I try to only take it when it’s really bad, like two or three times a week. Sometimes I take just one, sometimes two. But it doesn’t always help much anymore. And I don't want to take more, I’m scared of getting… hooked on them.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Larin. It's good you are aware of the potential for dependency and trying to use them sparingly. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on physically, would you be comfortable if I performed a physical examination of your back and legs?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That's… that’s probably a good idea. I just… please be gentle. It really hurts.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Larin. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by having you lie face down on the examination table. We’ll check your range of motion, assess tenderness, and perform some neurological tests to check your reflexes and sensation. Please let me know immediately if anything causes significant pain. If you would like, I can explain each step as I perform it.
PATIENT: Okay. Explaining it would be good, yeah. I get nervous when I don’t know what’s happening. And… please, just don’t push too hard. I really don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Larin. I understand. I will explain everything as I go, and we will proceed at your pace. We’ll stop immediately if you feel any significant discomfort. Alright. First, I’m going to gently palpate your lower back to assess for tenderness or muscle spasm. This just means I’ll be feeling for any areas that are particularly painful to the touch. Tell me if you feel any sharp pain or discomfort at any point. I’m noting some tenderness along your lower lumbar spine, primarily on the left side. Now I'm going to check your range of motion. I will ask you to gently bend forward, backward, and side to side, as comfortable as you can. We'll just see how far you can move without significant pain.
PATIENT: Okay… That’s… tender. Right there. Bending… That’s… hard. It really hurts to bend forward. And twisting… That’s bad too. I can’t go very far. It feels like something is blocking me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Larin. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. We’ll do this on both legs. This involves a gentle tap on your knee with a small hammer. It’s completely normal, and doesn’t usually cause any pain. Your reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'll assess sensation in your legs and feet. I'm going to lightly touch different areas of your skin and ask you to tell me when you feel it. This is to check for any numbness or tingling. How about here?
PATIENT: Yeah, I feel that one. And… that one. That one… feels kinda… funny. Not exactly numb, but not… normal either. Like pins and needles, maybe? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Larin. "Pins and needles" is a helpful description. Now, I’m going to perform the straight leg raise test. This involves lying on your back and I will gently lift your left leg, keeping it straight. This test helps assess for nerve compression. Please let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg as I lift it. Are you feeling any pain as I lift your leg?
PATIENT: Oof! Yes! That… that shoots down my leg! Right there! Please, stop! Don’t lift it anymore! It really hurts!
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, I’m stopping immediately. Thank you for letting me know. That’s very helpful information. Based on the physical examination, it appears you have some nerve irritation in your lower back, likely compressing a nerve root. The pain radiating down your leg, the altered sensation in your foot, and the positive straight leg raise test all point towards this. Now, given your previous diagnosis of a spot on your spine and your current symptoms, I believe it’s important to obtain some imaging studies to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to visualize the nerves and spinal cord and determine the cause of your pain. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: MRI… That sounds… scary. Will it show… if it’s gotten worse? I don't know… I don’t like the idea of finding out bad news. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe just more pain pills? Or… something else? I’m just… really scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Larin. It’s completely natural to feel scared when facing uncertainty, especially given your previous diagnosis. Let me assure you, obtaining an MRI isn’t about seeking bad news, it’s about gathering information so we can create the best possible treatment plan for you. While more pain pills might provide some temporary relief, they won’t address the underlying cause of your pain, and as you mentioned, you’re concerned about dependency. Other options, like physical therapy or injections, might be considered, but it’s difficult to recommend those without knowing the extent of the nerve compression and the cause of your pain. Think of the MRI as a tool – a way to get a clearer picture. We can discuss the results thoroughly and formulate a plan together. I will be here to support you every step of the way. Would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… explaining it would be good, yeah. I guess… if I know what to expect, it won’t be as scary. What does it… feel like? And how long does it take? Will it… hurt? And… will I have to be in a closed space? I really don’t like small spaces.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Larin. Let’s talk about the MRI. It stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, cylindrical machine. You’re right to ask about closed spaces – the machine is relatively narrow, but it’s not completely closed. There’s an opening on both ends, and you’ll have a bell you can ring at any time if you feel anxious or claustrophobic. During the scan, the machine will make loud knocking and buzzing noises. We’ll provide you with earplugs or headphones to minimize the noise. You’ll need to lie very still during the scan, which typically takes about 30-60 minutes. The MRI itself doesn’t hurt at all. You won’t feel anything during the scan. However, if you have any metal implants or devices in your body, such as a pacemaker or certain types of surgical clips, it might not be safe to undergo an MRI. Do you have any metal in your body?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I had surgery on my knee a long time ago, but I don't remember them putting any metal in it. Just… stitches. And… I have fillings in my teeth. Are those okay? And… what if I get scared inside the machine? Can I just… get out? I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Fillings are perfectly safe for an MRI. They won't interfere with the scan. And no, no metal implants beyond the knee surgery. Regarding the knee surgery, stitches don't contain metal, so that shouldn’t be a problem either. And absolutely, if you feel anxious or claustrophobic inside the machine at any time, you can press the emergency bell, and the scan will be stopped immediately. The technician will be right there with you, monitoring you the entire time. We can also discuss options to help manage your anxiety before the scan, such as a mild sedative. It’s important you feel comfortable. Do you feel better understanding the procedure now?
PATIENT: Yeah… a little bit. It still sounds scary, but knowing I can stop it if I need to helps. And… you said something about a sedative? What is that? And would it make me… sleepy? I have to get home after the scan, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Larin. A sedative is a medication that helps to relax you and reduce anxiety. It’s a common option for people who feel nervous about undergoing medical procedures like an MRI. There are different types of sedatives, and the one we might consider for you is a mild oral medication. It won’t knock you completely out, but it will help you feel more calm and comfortable during the scan. You will likely feel a bit drowsy after taking the sedative, which is why it’s essential to have someone drive you home after the scan. It’s also important to avoid operating machinery or making important decisions for a few hours after taking the medication. We can discuss this option further, and I can explain the potential side effects and risks in more detail if you’d like. Would you like me to write a referral for the MRI, and we can schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, I think… writing a referral sounds good. And… maybe the sedative. I don’t want to be scared inside that machine. And… having someone drive me is okay. My daughter, she can take me. But… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to wait too long to find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Larin. I’m glad we’ve come to a decision you feel comfortable with. I’m writing a referral to [Imaging Center Name] – they’re a reputable facility with experienced technicians. I’ll also note on the referral that you’d like to discuss a mild sedative. Typically, it takes about 24-48 hours for the radiologist to read the MRI results. I will have my nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. We can then discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well, and you didn’t rush me. I was really scared, but I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
