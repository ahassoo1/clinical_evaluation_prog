DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Be concise, if you would. My schedule is…rather full.
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s…Emileigh. I just moved here, and I think…I need to get set up with a doctor? It’s a social thing, I guess. Like, for healthcare. I have Medicare. I don’t…really know what else to say. It’s all kinda new.
DOCTOR: Medicare, yes. I see that. Very good. A “social thing,” you say?
PATIENT: Um…yeah. Like, the lady at the…place? She said I needed to pick a doctor ‘cause of my insurance. And I should come for a visit. Just to…check things. I don’t…feel sick or anything.
DOCTOR: A general check-up, then. Standard. While not ideal, I suppose we can accommodate. Have you had any prior medical care?
PATIENT: Prior…? Oh, um…I think so? When I was little…maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t really remember much about it. Just…shots, I think? And maybe a doctor when I broke my arm once, but…that was ages ago. I don’t know where that was, or who…anything, really.
DOCTOR: I see. A rather…sparse medical history, then. Very well. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… I don’t think so? I mean, nothing I know about, anyway. I’ve never…reacted to anything, as far as I remember. Does…like, being tired count? ‘Cause I get tired a lot. But I think everyone does.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Bonck, general fatigue does not constitute an allergy. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements…anything at all?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I don’t really…take pills, or anything. I try to just…get enough sleep, when I can. Not much luck with that lately, though.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with a basic physical examination. Please, step onto the scale. And try to stand still. I haven't all day.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it…is it a fancy one? Like, does it tell you a lot of stuff? I’m not good with numbers.
DOCTOR: It provides a weight, Ms. Bonck. A single, crucial data point. 82 kilograms. Now, please, onto the examination table. We’ll begin with your vital signs. And please, try to relax. Your apprehension is not conducive to accurate readings.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Vital signs… is that like… my heartbeat? I get kinda nervous at doctors, I guess. I don’t really like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, unsurprisingly. Blood pressure is…acceptable. Now, breathe deeply. I need to listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Like this? Or deeper? It’s kinda hard to breathe deep when you’re thinking about breathing deep. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, open your mouth. Let me take a look at your throat. Hmm. Any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not really. I mean, sometimes food gets stuck, but…that happens, right? Everyone chokes sometimes? It’s not a big deal, is it?
DOCTOR: Occasional dysphagia, you say?
PATIENT: Dys…what-ia? I just said food sometimes gets stuck. Like, when I eat too fast. Is that…bad? I don't know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Difficulty swallowing, Ms. Bonck. A layperson's term is acceptable. However, it warrants noting. Now, let’s move on. I need to palpate your abdomen. Lie flat.
PATIENT: Okay. Palpate…? Is that… pressing? It kinda tickles. Ooh, a little lower… that’s kinda sensitive.
DOCTOR: Sensitive, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, kinda. Not… painful, exactly. Just…tender? Like, if you push there? It's been kinda…off, lately. I thought it was just because I ate too much pizza.
DOCTOR: Subjective report of abdominal tenderness. While I appreciate your self-diagnosis, Ms. Bonck, it is insufficient. Now, let’s conclude this examination. We will need some blood work to rule out any underlying pathology.
PATIENT: Blood work…? Like, needles? I…I don’t really like needles. Is it gonna hurt a lot? And what…what are you looking for?
DOCTOR: A standard complete blood count and metabolic panel. It will assess your overall health and rule out any obvious abnormalities. And yes, it involves a small needle prick. It is…briefly uncomfortable. Now, do you require a chaperone for this procedure?
PATIENT: A…chaperone? For a needle? Uh, no. No, I don’t think so. I just…I get kinda lightheaded sometimes. Is there a chair I can sit in? Maybe if I sit down, it won’t be so bad?
DOCTOR: Very well. Sit, then. And please, try to remain still. I haven't got all day. This will sting momentarily. Do not flinch.
PATIENT: Okay… Just…tell me when it’s over? Please?
DOCTOR: Done. There. That wasn't so dreadful, was it?
PATIENT: Ow! …It stings. Yeah, it was…dreadful. Is it…is it bleeding a lot?
DOCTOR: Minimal bleeding. Within acceptable parameters. Now, the results will take approximately three to five business days. I will have the nurse contact you with the findings. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Uh…no. I think that’s it. Just…wait for the nurse to call? Thank you, Doctor. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. You may dress and depart. Do attempt to maintain a reasonable diet and obtain adequate rest. And please, do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any…untoward symptoms. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again. Bye.
