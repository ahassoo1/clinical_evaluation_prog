DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. It's my stomach. It just...won't stop. And nothing seems to help. Honestly, I haven't had a normal day in weeks. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I saw the nurse’s notes about your stomach issues. “Won’t stop,” alright. That sounds quite unpleasant. Could you tell me a little more about what’s going on?
PATIENT: What do you mean? I just told you! Diarrhea. Constant diarrhea. It’s…watery. And it happens multiple times a day. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells. Pepto, Imodium…you name it. It works for, like, an hour, maybe, and then it's back to…well, you get the picture. I’m just tired of talking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand it's unpleasant to discuss, Ms. Woodring, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's important to get the details so we can figure out what's causing it. When did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don't know. Weeks ago, probably. Maybe a month? It came on pretty gradually, I guess. I just thought it was something I ate at first, but it hasn’t gone away. It's not like I’ve been eating anything weird. And I definitely haven’t been anywhere exotic, if that's what you're thinking.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or so, gradually worsening. No recent travel or change in diet that you can think of. Has anything made it better at all, even temporarily, besides the Pepto and Imodium?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Maybe…lying down? But only for a little while. It always comes back. And honestly, I'm starting to think it's just…my luck. My husband…well, it doesn’t matter. Things just haven't been good since. Probably just my body being dramatic.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like this has been very disruptive. And it's good you're trying to manage it. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm running to the bathroom constantly! What other symptoms could there possibly be? I’m tired, obviously. And a little… dehydrated, I guess. But that’s just from…you know. Losing fluids. I haven't thrown up, if that's what you're asking. And no fever. Just…this. Constant. Mess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no vomiting, just fatigue and dehydration from the diarrhea. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, great. Now you want me to inspect my… Never mind. Yes. Sometimes. Not a lot, but…yes. It’s…darker than usual, sometimes. And there’s definitely…stuff. I don’t want to talk about it anymore. Honestly, are you even going to do anything, or are you just going to ask me questions until I cry?
DOCTOR: I apologize for asking such unpleasant questions, Ms. Woodring, but it’s important information. It helps me understand what might be going on. The blood and mucus are important to note. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your abdomen and do a gentle press to check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And please, be quick. I have things to do. Well, I would have things to do if I wasn’t spending all my time…you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. I’m listening now… sounds are a little hyperactive, which can be common with diarrhea. And…a little tenderness here, on your lower left side. Not severe, but noticeable. I don't feel any masses. Everything else seems normal. I'm going to check your vitals now.
PATIENT: See? I told you it hurts. It's always uncomfortable. Honestly, you doctors always make such a big deal out of everything. It's just my stomach. It's been like this for weeks. What are you even looking for? Some magical cure? It’s probably just something I ate. I'm telling you, it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. It’s good that we're documenting everything. I want to rule out anything serious, even if it turns out to be something simple. Your blood pressure is 118/72, pulse is 88, and temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Given your symptoms – the persistent diarrhea, the blood and mucus, the abdominal tenderness, and the fatigue – I'd like to order a stool sample to check for infection and inflammation. And a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia or infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Can't you just give me something to stop it? I don’t have time for tests. I have a life, or I did before this started. Fine. Do your tests, I guess. But if it’s nothing, I’m sending you the bill for my time wasted. And I want a prescription now for something that will actually work. Not some…placebo. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I’m going to order the stool sample and CBC. While we wait for the results, I can prescribe you a medication called loperamide, which is similar to Imodium, to help control the diarrhea. It may provide some relief in the meantime. However, I want to stress that it’s important to address the underlying cause, and we need those test results to do that. The nurse will give you instructions on how to collect the stool sample. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Loperamide? You mean Imodium? I already told you I tried that! It doesn’t work. But fine, whatever. Give me the prescription. I’ll try anything at this point. And no, I don’t have any allergies. Honestly, if I was allergic to everything, I wouldn’t be alive right now. Just…get me out of here. I need to go home and…deal with things. Can I just go? .
DOCTOR: Alright, the prescription is sent to your pharmacy. The nurse will provide you with the instructions on how to take it. I understand you're feeling frustrated, Ms. Woodring. I want to reassure you that we are taking this seriously and will do everything we can to figure out what’s causing your symptoms. We’ll call you with the test results as soon as they come back, usually within a few days. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
