DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets hard to breathe. It's been going on for… oh, I’d say about three weeks now, maybe a little longer. I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. Your breathing is important, and I want to understand what’s going on. Three weeks is definitely long enough to warrant a visit. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the sensation of being short of breath when you lie flat?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm gasping for air, Doctor. It's more like… a tightness. A heaviness in my chest. Like something is pressing down. And I have to… prop myself up with pillows. Two, usually. Sometimes three. It’s very uncomfortable. I don’t know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Vanderwiele. A tightness and heaviness are good descriptions. And needing two or three pillows to sleep comfortably is a significant detail. Do you experience this shortness of breath at any other time, besides when lying flat?
PATIENT: No, not really. When I’m sitting up, or walking around… I'm fine. Perfectly normal. It’s just… the lying down. It’s a nuisance, really. I used to sleep so soundly, and now… well, you know. It’s very frustrating. I don’t want to complain, but… it’s affecting my sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Vanderwiele. Sleep is vital, and being unable to rest comfortably is certainly concerning. To help me rule out different possibilities, let's go through a bit more detail. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Let me think… I haven’t paid much attention, Doctor. I suppose… maybe a little. Just at the very end of the day, sometimes. But I thought that was just from being on my feet. I work at the library, you know. A lot of standing. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important information, Ms. Vanderwiele. Standing for extended periods can certainly contribute to some swelling. However, it's good we are noting it. Do you have any history of heart problems, or has a doctor ever mentioned anything about your heart?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a thing. My father had high blood pressure, I believe. But that was a long time ago. And I always thought I was pretty healthy. I eat my vegetables, I walk when I can… I don't smoke, never have. I'm not sure what's causing this. It’s just… worrying, really. I don't like feeling like this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your father’s history and your generally healthy habits, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's understandable to be worried when experiencing new symptoms. Now, let's briefly review other systems. Have you been experiencing any coughing, wheezing, or chest pain—besides the tightness you've described—at any time?
PATIENT: No coughing, Doctor. And no wheezing. Just the tightness when I lie down. And no, no chest pain. It’s more… uncomfortable pressure. Like a weight. And it doesn’t radiate anywhere. Just… in my chest. I hope that makes sense. I’m trying to be as clear as possible. I don’t want to waste your time with unnecessary details.
DOCTOR: You are being very clear, Ms. Vanderwiele, and I appreciate your efforts. The distinction between pressure and pain is helpful. Alright. Now, to be thorough, have you noticed any recent weight gain or loss?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I don't think so. Maybe a pound or two, but nothing significant. My appetite hasn't changed. I eat about the same amount as always. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, if that makes a difference. I used to, but… well, I got busy. It's just the breathing that’s bothering me, really. Are we getting anywhere? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright that you haven’t been weighing yourself regularly, Ms. Vanderwiele. We are getting somewhere. To complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my Medicare Part D prescription for my blood pressure. A small dose, Doctor Shely. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I'll take an ibuprofen. That's about it. Nothing else. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. It's usually just the ibuprofen, and not even very often. I'm very careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. That’s helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… please be quick, if you could. My appointment is at 2:30. I don't want to be late. I really do appreciate you seeing me. It's just… a nuisance, this breathing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will be as efficient as possible. I'm listening to your lungs now... Take a few deep breaths for me, please. I'm hearing slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. And your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a very mild murmur. No significant edema in your extremities. Okay. Now, I'd like to check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is within a normal range.
PATIENT: Okay. That's good to know, I suppose. Diminished breath sounds... what does that mean, exactly? And a murmur... that sounds serious. Is it something to worry about? I really don't want to have tests, Doctor. I get anxious easily. Just tell me, is it something bad? I just want to be able to sleep comfortably again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Vanderwiele, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. Diminished breath sounds can have a number of causes, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. It can sometimes be due to shallow breathing, or a little bit of fluid buildup in the lungs. The mild murmur I’m hearing is also common, especially with age, and often doesn’t cause any problems. However, given your symptoms of shortness of breath when lying flat, and the diminished breath sounds, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. It will help us rule out any underlying issues, such as fluid in the lungs or other abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… Well, I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. But I really do get anxious. I had one years ago, and the machine… it felt so confining. And the waiting room… so many sick people. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. But please, just make it as quick as possible. And is there any chance it could be something else? Something that wouldn't require… all that? I have that appointment at 2:30, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties completely, Ms. Vanderwiele. We will do everything to make the experience as comfortable as possible for you. The machine is open in the front now, so it's not as confining as it used to be. And we can schedule it for right away, to minimize your time in the waiting room. It could be a number of things, Ms. Vanderwiele. It could be mild heart failure, which is often manageable with medication, or it could be a lung condition. The X-ray will help us determine the exact cause. While we await the results, I’d also like to order a BNP blood test, which can help assess for heart failure. We’ll get those tests ordered immediately, and I’ll call you as soon as the results are available—hopefully by tomorrow. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your head with extra pillows at night, and avoiding lying flat as much as possible. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Extra pillows… yes, I’ve been doing that already. And avoiding lying flat… that’s not a problem. I suppose. And if it is something bad… heart failure, you said? What does that even mean? Will I have to be hospitalized? I have no one to… look after me, you know. My daughter lives too far away. Just tell me, honestly, Doctor. Is it serious? I just want to know what I’m facing. And please, just hurry with those tests. I’m getting quite anxious just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re anxious, Ms. Vanderwiele. It’s good you’re asking these questions. Mild heart failure, if that’s what it is, doesn’t necessarily mean hospitalization. Often, it’s manageable with medication and lifestyle changes—reducing salt intake, monitoring fluid levels, and taking prescribed medications. We won't know for sure until we have the test results. But even if it is heart failure, it’s often a chronic condition that can be effectively managed with regular follow-up care. I will work with you every step of the way, to ensure you receive the best possible care. I’m ordering the X-ray and BNP test right now, and I’ll call you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, if your shortness of breath worsens, or you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… call me as soon as you can. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor Shely. And thank you for being so patient. I guess I’ll go home and… try to relax. And elevate my head with pillows. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before I call with the results. Get home safely and try to rest. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
