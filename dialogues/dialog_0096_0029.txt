DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, welcome. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s my stomach, I think. I get full awful quick now. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now, just a few bites and I feel like I ate a whole feast. It’s been happening for a few months now, maybe longer. Hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. A few months, you say. And it's just a feeling of fullness quickly, not necessarily pain with eating?
PATIENT: No, not pain, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Like my stomach’s saying “enough!” way too early. It’s just… frustrating. I like my food, you see. And my wife makes a lovely salmon chowder. Can’t even finish a bowl anymore.
DOCTOR: Well, at our age, things do slow down, Mr. Obarr. Digestion isn’t what it used to be. But “lovely salmon chowder”... is it a very…rich chowder?
PATIENT: Rich? Oh, yes. My wife, Elsie, she doesn’t hold back on the cream. And butter. Everything’s better with butter, she says. She’s a good cook, though. A really good cook. It’s just… I'm worried something else is going on, you know? It doesn't seem right to be full after just a few spoonfuls.
DOCTOR: Well, cream and butter are rather… substantial. We should probably discuss your overall diet. Do you find you’re experiencing any other symptoms alongside this early fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. I’ve lost a little weight, maybe five or ten pounds? Elsie says so, anyway. She’s always noticing things. And… sometimes I feel a bit tired, but I’m eighty-eight years old, Doctor. Tired seems pretty normal. I wouldn’t say it’s anything major.
DOCTOR: Right. Weight loss can be concerning, even if it’s gradual. And fatigue... well, that could be a number of things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Oh, dear. Now you’re asking things a fella doesn’t usually talk about. Um… they’re… regular enough, I suppose. Maybe a little looser than they used to be? But nothing drastic. I haven’t been worried enough to say anything to Elsie, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. Elsie keeps track of it, makes sure I take it every morning with my tea. I don't recall the name, though. She knows everything. Really, she does.
DOCTOR: Well, we’ll need to get the name of that medication for our records. And I think a quick physical exam would be a good idea. Just to get a baseline, you understand. Let's start by listening to your abdomen, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. And alright, sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I've lived a long life, but I'd like to keep living it a little longer, you know? Especially if Elsie keeps making that chowder.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have you lie down on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your stomach with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Hmm. Sounds a bit… sluggish, if I'm being honest. Not alarming, but certainly not as lively as it should be. I'll also check for any tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just… uncomfortable, like I said. It feels a bit tender if you press right… there. But not really painful. More like… sensitive. Elsie always said I was a sensitive fella. Maybe that’s all it is.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, sensitivity can indicate something going on. It could be something as simple as gastritis, or something a bit more… involved. Given your age and weight loss, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, just to rule things out. And a stool sample, to check for any hidden issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A stool sample? Well… I suppose so. If it's important. Elsie always says I worry too much about… these things. But alright, I’ll do it. Blood work and… the other thing. As long as it helps figure out what's going on. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and stool sample. The lab is just down the hall. They'll need your insurance information, though you mentioned you aren't insured. We’ll have to work something out with them. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you try a bland diet for a few days. No rich foods, no cream, no butter. Stick to things like plain toast, rice, and boiled chicken. And see if that makes a difference. We'll review the results when they come back and decide what the next steps are. Is there anything else you want to mention?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Elsie will be glad to hear I'm trying a bland diet, I reckon. She's always telling me to watch what I eat. I suppose I should listen to her more often. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. Even the… the other thing. I’ll get this done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Obarr. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms.
