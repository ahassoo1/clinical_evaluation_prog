DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Ruocco, yes. It’s… it’s this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It's… hard to explain. Been happening for a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long. Everything’s a bit fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s perfectly alright if things are a bit fuzzy. We’ll take our time. So, this pain you’re feeling when you breathe deep… can you tell me where exactly it’s located?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… in my chest, mostly. Not like a sharp pain, not really. More like… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like it goes through to my back a little. But mostly in the chest. I used to do a lot of heavy lifting, working construction, you know? Maybe it’s something from that? I don't rightly know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the chest, sometimes radiating to the back. And you used to do heavy lifting in construction. That’s helpful information. Now, when did you notice this pain starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s the hard part. It wasn't sudden, not like I remember. Just… slowly got there. Maybe a few months ago? Or longer? I’m divorced now, you see, and things got… mixed up a bit then. Hard to keep track of dates and whatnot. It's just been getting a little worse lately, that's why I figured I should come in. It bothers me when I walk up the stairs, too.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you're not sure of the exact timing. A few months, gradually worsening, and now it’s bothering you with stairs. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Better? Not really, no. Sitting still, maybe. If I don't do much, it's not as bad. Lying down doesn't help much either, honestly. It's just… always there, a little bit. Sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker. It's a nuisance, really. I don't have insurance, you see, so I try to ignore things as long as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a consistent ache, not really relieved by rest, and it’s been bothering you enough to seek attention despite not having insurance. That takes courage. Now, aside from the pain, have you experienced any other symptoms—like coughing, shortness of breath, fever, or any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No fever, no. Coughing… sometimes. Just a little tickle in my throat, nothing much. And no, no swelling in my legs. I used to be pretty active, but I don’t get around as much now. Shortness of breath… hmm. Maybe a little when I really push myself, like walking up those stairs. But I figured that was just getting old! Everything's slowing down, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, occasional cough, and mild shortness of breath with exertion. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of dust or fumes in your work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Lots of dust. Construction, you see. Concrete dust, wood dust, all sorts of things. And… yes, I smoked for a long time. Quit maybe… twenty years ago? It was a long time ago. Before I got divorced. Everything feels like it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of smoking, though you quit twenty years ago, and significant dust exposure from your construction work. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about that, a long time ago. Said I needed to watch my salt. But honestly, I don’t remember much about it. And no, no diabetes. I’m not sure about heart problems… never been told I had any. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of being told you have high blood pressure in the past, but not much recall of details, and no known history of heart problems. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never really been one for taking pills. Tried something for my blood pressure, maybe, a long time ago. Didn't like how it made me feel, so I stopped. Don't take anything now. Just try to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I eat pretty much anything. No allergies, no. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just an old man with a bit of a chest ache. I just want to get it sorted out if it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Mr. Ruocco. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your chest. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just get it over with as quickly as you can, if you don't mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm listening now. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay. I do hear some diminished breath sounds at the bases of both lungs, and there’s some tenderness when I press on your chest here, on the left side. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And your heart rate is a little fast. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing and feeling, it sounds like you could have a few things going on. It could be related to your history of smoking and dust exposure, and the elevated blood pressure and swelling in your ankles. It’s possible you have some early signs of heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. However, we would need to do some tests to confirm this. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a BNP level, which helps us assess your heart function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure? COPD? Those sound… serious. Tests… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But how much will they cost? I don’t have insurance, you see, and I’m on a fixed income. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Ruocco. It's a valid worry. Let me explain a bit more about the tests and then we can discuss options for affordability. The chest X-ray will give us a picture of your lungs and heart, helping us see if there's any evidence of fluid buildup or damage. The blood work will tell us about your overall health and help us assess your heart function. I know you don't have insurance, so let me see what we can do. Our clinic does have a financial assistance program for patients with limited income. I can have one of the administrative staff explain the application process to you. We can also look at the cost of each test individually and see if there are any lower-cost options available. It's also possible that a local hospital has a charity care program that you might qualify for. Would you like me to have someone come in and discuss these options with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I don't understand all this medical stuff, and I definitely don't understand the financial part. Anything you can do to help me figure it out would be… a blessing. I just want to know what’s going on, and what I can do about it, without ending up bankrupt.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I completely understand. It’s our job to help you navigate this. Let me call Sarah, our patient financial coordinator, and she can come in and talk to you about the available options. Sarah, could you please come to exam room three?
