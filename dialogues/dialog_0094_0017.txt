DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Uh… well, it’s about this… tryout. For the team. A physical, they said I needed one. My ex-wife… she made me get it. Said I was too old for all this running around. Honestly, I feel alright. Mostly alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok, a physical for a team tryout. That's perfectly reasonable. And it's good you're getting it checked out, regardless of what your ex-wife says! So, just to clarify, you said you feel "mostly alright." Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Mostly alright… hmm. Well, my knees. They… ache sometimes. Not all the time. After, you know… being on them a lot. And my back. It cracks. Loudly. But I’ve always had a cracking back. It doesn't hurt hurt, just… cracks. I don’t remember ever, uh… breaking anything. Never had to go to the hospital for anything serious. At least, I don’t think I did. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, knees aching after activity and a cracking back – that gives us a good starting point. And good to know you haven’t had any major injuries or hospitalizations. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a few things. First, can you tell me what kind of team you're trying out for?
PATIENT: The… softball team. Old Man Hemmings runs it. Down at the park. It's… recreation. Not the big leagues or anything. Just… a bunch of us fellas getting some exercise. We play every Tuesday and Thursday. Well, when it’s not raining. I’ve been playing with them… for years, I think. Maybe ten years? Or was it fifteen? Time flies, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, it certainly does. Softball, that's good to know. So it's a recreational league, which is helpful. To understand what might be going on with your knees and back, could you describe the pain in your knees a bit more?
PATIENT: It's not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a… dull ache. Right in the joint, you know? Especially after running the bases. Or sliding. I try not to slide anymore, too much trouble. It gets worse if it’s cold. Damp weather is bad too. And… well, going up and down stairs. My ex-wife has stairs. Lots of stairs. Made it harder to visit the kids, that’s for sure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Bartok. A dull ache in the joint, worse with activity, cold weather, and going down stairs – that's very helpful information. It sounds like it could be some osteoarthritis, but we'll need to do a quick exam to get a better feel for things. Before we do that, are you experiencing any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Sometimes my shoulder gets a little… stiff. But I just work it out. Construction, you know? Lots of lifting. Nothing I can't handle. Oh! And my hands… they get numb sometimes. Especially at night. But I figured it was just… old age. My father had the same problem. He was a carpenter, good one too. Not a doctor though. Never needed a doctor much, until… well, until my ex-wife. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That definitely counts! We'll get to the bottom of all of it. Okay, so stiffness in your shoulder and numbness in your hands, especially at night. Your father had similar hand issues—that's good to know. It sounds like we might be dealing with some arthritis in multiple joints, and potentially some nerve compression in your hands. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… thorough. I suppose that’s good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I got to get back to the job site. Old Man Hemmings… he’s not always understanding. Exam is fine. Just… be gentle, please. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand you need to get back to work. If you could just lie down on your back for me, please. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll move on to checking your knees, back, and hands. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Can you take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breath… like this? It always feels strange, having someone listen to you like that. My father never went to doctors either. Said they just try to sell you things you don’t need. But my ex-wife… she insisted. Said I was reckless. Reckless and old. Deep breath again?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend your knees for me, as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… about as far as they go, Doctor. They creak a bit. Like an old door. My ex-wife used to complain about the noise when I came home late. Said I woke up the whole house. It’s the cartilage, I think. Old Man Hemmings said so. He used to play baseball, knows a thing or two. It hurts a little when I bend them that far. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. A dull ache, like before. Is that what you want to hear?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Bartok. I can feel some crepitus – that grinding sensation – and a little tenderness on the inside of both knees. There’s no swelling, which is good. Your range of motion is a bit limited, but not severely. Now, let’s check your back. Can you point to where it cracks?
PATIENT: Right about here, Doctor. It’s not always the same spot, but mostly around here. It doesn't hurt, just… cracks. Loudly. Especially when I twist. Like this. See? My ex-wife said I was falling apart. Said I needed to slow down. But Old Man Hemmings… he says a little cracking is normal. Keeps the joints loose, he says. What do you think, Doctor? Are my joints falling apart?
DOCTOR: That's a fairly typical sound, Mr. Bartok, and often doesn't indicate a problem. Your range of motion is good, and I don’t feel any significant tenderness. It sounds like you have some normal age-related changes in your spine. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me, as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor. It’s… harder than it used to be. And they get numb sometimes, like I said. Especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep. And gripping things… sometimes I drop them. My ex-wife… she complained about that too. Said I was a liability. Said I couldn’t even hold a coffee cup properly. They feel… stiff. And a little weak. What do you think? Arthritis? Is that what’s wrong with my hands?
DOCTOR: I can see some mild swelling in a few of your finger joints, and your grip strength is slightly reduced. I also notice some stiffness when you move your fingers. Based on what you've told me and what I've found in the exam, it does seem likely that you have some arthritis in your hands, most likely osteoarthritis. It's also possible there is some mild carpal tunnel syndrome contributing to the numbness, but we would need to do some additional testing to confirm that. Now, I want to be thorough. We will get some blood work done to rule out other forms of arthritis. I am also going to order X-rays of your knees, back, and hands. This will help me get a better look at the bones and joints. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with any medicine before. My ex-wife gave me all sorts of things for my aches and pains. Pills, creams… everything she could find. Never seemed to help much, honestly. Just made me sleepy. Blood work and X-rays… sounds serious, Doctor. Is it bad? Are my joints really falling apart? And carpal tunnel… what’s that? Is that something you fix with surgery? I don’t want surgery. Old Man Hemmings says surgery is the last resort. He knows a guy… a retired doctor. Says you have to be very careful.
DOCTOR: It's good you don't have any known allergies. And no, it doesn't necessarily mean your joints are "falling apart," Mr. Bartok. The blood work and X-rays are just to get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we get older, and it doesn't always require surgery. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that occurs when a nerve in your wrist gets compressed, causing numbness and tingling in your hands. It can often be treated with splints, exercises, or sometimes injections. Surgery is an option if other treatments don't work, but it's rarely the first course of action. I’ll write you an order for the blood work and X-rays, and the radiology department will schedule you for an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. This might include over-the-counter pain relievers, physical therapy, and exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your flexibility. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Just some ibuprofen sometimes, when my knees really bother me. And sometimes I take a sleeping pill, but only when I can’t sleep. My ex-wife gave me a bottle, says it helps. It makes me a little groggy in the morning, but… it works. That’s about it. I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. Always thought they just masked the problem. Old Man Hemmings says you need to build up your strength, that’s the only way to fix things. He used to be a carpenter, knows a thing or two about the body. So… just ibuprofen and the sleeping pill. Is that all you need to know? I got to get back to work, Doctor. Old Man Hemmings… he’s not very patient.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Bartok. Ibuprofen as needed, and the sleeping pill occasionally. It’s good to know. Okay, so to summarize: you've been experiencing aches and pains in your knees, back, and hands, with some stiffness and numbness in your hands. You've tried ibuprofen and a sleeping pill, with limited relief. I've ordered blood work and X-rays to get a clearer picture, and we’ll discuss a treatment plan once the results are back. I’m going to give you a handout with some exercises you can do to strengthen your muscles and improve your flexibility. It’s a good idea to start these exercises gently, and stop if you feel any pain. I'll also write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory medication to try in the meantime, if the ibuprofen isn't helping enough. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Exercises… hmm. Sounds like a lot of work. And stronger anti-inflammatory… are those the pills that make your stomach hurt? My ex-wife always warned me about those. She said they weren’t good for you. And what about Old Man Hemmings? He says I need to build up my strength, not take pills. He has a special routine he does with weights… says it keeps his joints loose. Is that better than the exercises? And… will this keep me from playing softball? I don't want to miss the games. That's the only thing I got left, really. And will this cost me a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Medicare covers most things, right? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Bartok. Let’s address them one by one. The exercises are a good starting point, and we can adjust them based on your comfort level. We can also discuss modifications if they’re too difficult. Regarding the anti-inflammatory medication, you’re right to be cautious. They can sometimes cause stomach upset, but we can prescribe a medication that has a protective coating to minimize that risk. We can also recommend taking it with food. As for Old Man Hemmings’ routine, that sounds good too! Strength training is excellent, but it's important to do it properly to avoid injury. We can discuss his routine and make sure it’s safe for you. Regarding your softball games, the goal is to help you continue playing! The treatment plan will focus on managing your pain and improving your function so you can stay active. And finally, about the cost: yes, Medicare should cover most of the tests and treatments. However, there may be some co-pays or deductibles. I'll have the billing department verify your coverage and let you know what to expect. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear. About the softball, that’s the most important thing. And Medicare… as long as they cover most of it, I’ll be alright. I guess I can try the exercises… but I’m still not sure about the pills. Maybe I’ll just stick with the ibuprofen for now. And Old Man Hemmings’ routine… I’ll ask him about it. He knows a thing or two. I think… that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And for not making me feel too old. My ex-wife… she always made me feel ancient. I guess I’ll go get those tests done. And try not to fall apart before then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bartok. I understand your concerns, and we’ll take things at your pace. Feel free to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. Don’t worry about feeling old – you’re doing the right thing by getting this checked out, and we’ll work together to keep you active and healthy. Have a good day, and good luck with your softball games! .
