DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pipkorn, you said? Right. Well, it’s… my face. And my legs. They’re puffin’ up. Like balloons, almost. It’s been goin’ on for a bit now, can’t rightly say how long, though. Time just kinda… slips away, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Puffin’ up,” you say. And this is…both your face and legs?
PATIENT: Yeah, both. Mostly my legs, I reckon. They get real tight, too. Makes it hard to get my boots on, especially. Used to be able to do it without even thinkin’. Now… it's a whole production. Face gets kinda… lumpy, I guess you’d say. Not painful, just… noticeable. My wife used to fuss over it, but… well, never you mind about that now. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Lumpy,” alright. And this swelling…does it happen at certain times of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I think it’s worse in the evenin’. After I’ve been on my feet all day at work. It goes down a bit when I… when I sit for a while. But then it just builds up again. Not always, mind you. Sometimes it’s bad all day long. Hard to say for sure, honestly. I don't spend a lot of time thinkin' about when my legs are puffin' up, ya know? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Well, let’s try to get a clearer picture. Do you have any other symptoms along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other than lookin’ like a blowfish? Nah, not really. I get tired easier, I suppose. But I’m fifty-nine years old! What do you expect? Maybe a bit short of breath sometimes, but again… work. It's dusty down at the shop. I don't sleep as good as I used to, either. But that's probably just… old age creepin’ in. I don't go lookin' for trouble, if ya know what I mean. Everything aches a little, all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what exactly do you do at this “shop”?
PATIENT: Welding, mostly. And soldering. Brazing, too. Fixin’ things, ya know? Metalwork. Been doin’ it for forty years, ever since I left school. It’s honest work, keeps the hands busy. Lots of standin’, lots of heat. Gets kinda… monotonous, sometimes, but a man’s gotta eat. I set up the machines, then I operate 'em. It’s not rocket science, if that’s what you’re askin’.
DOCTOR: Do you wear any protective gear when you’re welding—a mask, gloves, anything like that?
PATIENT: Mask, yeah. Always wear a mask. Gotta protect your eyes, don't ya? Gloves, sometimes. Depends on the job. If it's a dirty job, I'll put 'em on. Mostly, I just get on with it. Been doin' it so long, ya get used to the smell, the heat, everything. Don't bother with a lot of fancy safety gear unless I absolutely have to. Slows ya down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues—anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned somethin’ about that, years ago. Told me to watch my salt intake. Didn't really pay much mind to it. Always felt fine. Never bothered with pills, ya know? Don’t like puttin’ things in my body that don't belong there. Besides, my wife kept a close eye on things. She was the healthy one, always eatin' right and exercisin'. I just… didn’t bother with all that. Other than that… can’t rightly say. Never been a sickly man.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbin’ a tree. But that wasn’t a hospital stay, just a cast. Had my tonsils out, I suppose, when I was little. But that was a long time ago, barely remember it. Other than that… no. Never been one for doctors or hospitals. Waste of time, if ya ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you take any medications currently—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements—anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Like I said, don't put nothin’ in my body that doesn’t belong there. My wife, she took somethin' for her arthritis, but that was her problem. I just… never needed anythin’. Good Swedish blood, I reckon. We’re a tough bunch.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Don't expect much, though. I'm a bit… rough around the edges. Just try not to poke me too hard. I bruise easy.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. A bit elevated. Heart rate is regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but there’s some mild wheezing on exhalation. Significant pitting edema in both lower extremities, extending up to the mid-calf. Noting pitting edema bilaterally. Skin is warm to the touch, with some mild discoloration. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now.
PATIENT: Go ahead. Don't expect much there either. I've got a bit of a gut, ya know? Years of good Swedish food, I reckon. Mostly just soft. Not much to find in there, I promise ya. Just a bit of extra padding. Go on, poke around. I've been poked and prodded worse than this, trust me.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. There’s some mild fullness, but no palpable masses or organomegaly. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Mild facial edema, particularly around the eyes and cheeks. Skin is warm and smooth. Alright. That completes the physical examination. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine analysis. We need to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms.
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. Never had so much poked and prodded before, I gotta say. Fine by me, I suppose. If it gets to the bottom of things. When will I get the results? And… will it be expensive? I ain’t insured, ya know. My wife… well, she handled all that stuff. I’m a bit lost without her.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. As for the cost… I understand you’re uninsured. Let me speak with the billing department and see if we can arrange a payment plan or explore any available assistance programs. It's difficult to give you an exact figure at this time, but we will do our best to work with you. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake and limiting your fluid consumption. We also need to rule out heart failure as a possible cause. Based on your symptoms and the initial examination, I suspect this could be related to kidney problems, potentially exacerbated by high blood pressure. However, we need the lab results to confirm this. Until we have the results, I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Emergency room… sounds serious. Shortness of breath, chest pain… Never had that before, knock on wood. Kidney problems… My wife, she had some trouble with her kidneys near the end. Is that what this is? Is that what's happenin' to me? I… I don't know. I suppose I don't have many questions. Just… is it bad? Will I be alright? And… how much is all this gonna cost?
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms. The lab results are crucial. Your wife's kidney problems could be relevant, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. There are many potential causes for swelling and fatigue. As for the cost, I understand your concern. I've already spoken with the billing department, and they've assured me they will work with you to create a manageable payment plan. We will also explore any available financial assistance programs. I can’t give you an exact figure at this time, but they will contact you directly once the charges are processed. I want to be upfront with you: kidney problems can be serious, but they are often manageable with proper treatment. The sooner we get a diagnosis, the sooner we can start addressing the issue. For now, please focus on reducing your salt intake, limiting your fluid consumption, and monitoring your symptoms closely. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling, please do not hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Salt… fluids… right. Less salt. Less water. I can do that, I reckon. It’s just… everything feels so… overwhelming. My wife, she always knew what to do. She took care of everything. Now… I feel lost. Emergency room… alright. If I get short of breath… or chest pain… I’ll go. I promise. So… just wait for the results? And try not to worry? That's easier said than done, ya know? I got a bad feelin' about this. A really bad feelin'. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. For tryin’ to help, at least. I guess I'll just… wait. And try to remember to avoid the salt.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Miner. We’ll do our best to get these results back to you as quickly as possible. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your condition. And remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution. I'll have the nurse provide you with a written summary of our discussion and instructions for follow-up. Have a good day, Mr. Miner.
