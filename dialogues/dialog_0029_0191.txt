DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I asked if I could come in… I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s just… a precaution, really. I’d like to know my status, for peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A precautionary check is always a good idea. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my husband and I… we haven't been as careful as we should be, lately. And I just… I worry. It’s silly, perhaps, we’ve been together a long time, but with everything you hear on the news… I thought it best to be sure. It’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. It's never silly to be proactive about your health, especially with concerns like this. And you're right, it's always good to be informed. Now, to clarify, when you say "not as careful," can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… we haven’t been using protection every time. It’s been… infrequent. A few times over the past couple of months, perhaps. I don’t want to get into specifics, if that’s alright. But it wasn’t consistent, and that’s what’s bothering me. It’s foolish, I know. We should have been more diligent.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. I understand your discretion. Just knowing it wasn’t consistent is helpful. Have either you or your husband had any other potential exposures to HIV – for example, through blood transfusions, needle sharing, or other sexual partners?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. We've both been faithful to each other, always. And neither of us has ever… well, we’ve never used anything like needles. And we’ve both always had our bloodwork done through the same doctor, so I'm quite certain there haven’t been any issues there either. It's just… this recent lapse in caution between us.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have either of you experienced any symptoms that have you concerned – things like fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, or a rash?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get tired, but that's just… being my age, I think. And I sometimes get little aches and pains, but nothing I haven't experienced before. My husband says he feels perfectly fine too. No rashes, no swollen anything. It really is just this worry that’s been building up.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I haven't had any problems with any medication I've ever taken. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's all, and I’ve never had a reaction to it. Just a small dose, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It's… let me see… Ah, here it is. Lisinopril. 10 milligrams, once a day. It’s been keeping things stable, thankfully. I don’t really have any side effects, so I haven’t had to bother the doctor about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Good. Now, Ms. Shaub, to proceed with the HIV test, we'll need a blood sample. There are a few different types of tests we can do. The most common is an antibody test, which can detect antibodies your body makes to fight HIV. However, it can take a few weeks after exposure to show up as positive. There’s also a newer test that detects the virus itself, which can give results sooner. Would you prefer the quicker test, or are you comfortable with the standard antibody test?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a little confusing. I suppose… if the quicker test is more accurate, then that would be better. I just want to know, you see. The sooner the better, I think. I don't want to be left wondering for weeks. So yes, the quicker test, if that’s alright. Is it more expensive?
DOCTOR: Yes, the quicker test detects the virus itself and can provide results sooner. It's generally more accurate in the early stages of infection. It is slightly more expensive, but given your insurance situation, we can discuss that. It will be $125. Before we proceed, I want to confirm that you understand that a negative test result doesn't completely rule out HIV, especially if you were recently exposed. We might need to repeat the test in a few weeks if you have further concerns. Do you understand?
PATIENT: $125… alright. That's… manageable. Yes, I understand. You’re saying even if it’s negative now, it doesn't mean I’m completely safe, and we might need to do it again later? That’s… a little worrying. But I suppose it's better to be sure. Yes, I understand. Let's do the test then, the quicker one. I want to know for certain, one way or another.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I agree, it’s best to have as much information as possible. If you'll have a seat, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It's a standard procedure. While we wait, let me document your concerns and the plan. I also want to ask about your general health… have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you. A physical… let me think. It was… about six months ago, I believe. Doctor Adebayo. She did all the usual things, checked my blood pressure, listened to my heart, that sort of thing. Everything was fine then, as far as I know. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just a routine check-up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Do you remember if any specific bloodwork was done during that exam, like a complete blood count or a metabolic panel?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… she did a lot of vials, so I assume so. She said it was a comprehensive check-up. She didn’t mention anything being wrong, so I suppose it was all normal. I don’t have the results with me, I’m afraid. I just remember her saying everything looked good. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can proceed without the results. While we wait for the nurse, let’s briefly discuss risk reduction strategies. Regardless of the test results, it’s important to use protection during sexual activity to prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Have you discussed this with your husband?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, well… that’s rather awkward. We have talked about it, a little. It’s… not a comfortable subject, to be honest. After… after this recent lapse, we both agreed we should be more careful. But talking about it and doing it are two different things, you see. It's just… after so long, it feels strange to start all over again. But we know we should. We really do. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand that it can be a difficult conversation, Ms. Shaub. It’s important to remember that open communication and consistent protection are key. There are many resources available to help couples discuss safe sex practices. Here comes the nurse now. She’ll explain the blood draw procedure. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m alright, thank you, Doctor. Just… anxious, I suppose. But no, I don't think so. I'll let the nurse handle the blood draw. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring, to be honest. A little frightening, but reassuring.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just remember, we’re here to support you through this. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible and discuss them thoroughly. Let me know if anything comes to mind. Nurse, are you ready for Ms. Shaub?
