DOCTOR: "Bula Lilyanna! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a bit of unsteadiness, you see. It's rather unsettling, and I was advised to come and have it looked at. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, so I don’t recall precisely when it began, but it’s been… concerning lately.
DOCTOR: “Okay, unsteadiness… that’s good you came in to get it checked out. And no worries at all about the memory – it happens! We’ll take our time and figure things out. So, when you say 'unsteadiness', can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s difficult to explain. It’s not… dizziness, precisely. More like… a loss of balance. As if the ground isn’t quite steady beneath my feet. Sometimes it's just a wobble, other times… well, I nearly fell yesterday while walking to the truck. It happens unexpectedly, and that’s what’s most worrying. I don't always feel off-balance, but then I suddenly am. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: “Yes, that makes sense. So, it’s not spinning, more of a sudden feeling of instability, even when you don’t feel dizzy beforehand. And it happened yesterday while walking to your truck… was that on even ground, or were you on a slope or uneven surface?
PATIENT: It was… mostly level, I believe. The parking lot is generally quite flat. There’s a slight incline leading up to the entrance, but I hadn’t reached that yet. It just… gave way beneath me, as if my feet weren’t quite holding me. I managed to steady myself against the truck, thankfully. It was quite frightening. I don’t recall anything like this happening before my… before my husband passed. Or, if it did, it wasn’t nearly so pronounced.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s helpful to know. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Grief can absolutely manifest in many ways, and sometimes those ways can be physical. But we’ll want to rule out other causes as well. Let's talk a bit more about this unsteadiness. Does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I work out on the rigs, you see. It’s quite physical, a lot of walking and standing. I suppose it could be fatigue, though I'm accustomed to the work. And… the heat, perhaps? It's been exceptionally warm lately. But it hasn’t happened every time I’m tired or warm. Truly, I haven’t been able to pinpoint a specific cause. It feels rather random, which is what makes it so unsettling. I’m afraid I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: “You’re being very helpful, Lilyanna. It is often difficult to pinpoint the cause, and random occurrences are common with many conditions. Knowing what isn’t triggering it is just as useful. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe I had a bout of… influenza, several years ago. Nothing serious, recovered fully. And… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young. Other than that… I’m generally quite healthy, or I was, before this unsteadiness. I’ve always been a strong, active person. I don’t take any regular medications, if that’s relevant. And… I have private insurance, if that’s needed for any testing. I'm truly trying to recall anything else, but my memory… it’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: “Okay, influenza in the past, appendix removed as a child, and no current medications. That’s good to know. And yes, the insurance information is helpful. Don’t worry about the memory – we’ll take things slowly. Now, have you ever experienced any headaches, vision changes, or ringing in your ears alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing severe, just a mild ache, like tension. I often get those from the work, the noise and strain. Vision changes… no, I don’t believe so. My eyesight is still quite good, thankfully. And ringing in the ears… perhaps a little, from time to time, but that’s also common on the rigs, with the machinery. It’s usually temporary, fades quickly. I wouldn’t say it’s related to this… this imbalance, though. It’s just… background noise, if you understand. I do sometimes feel a little… disconnected, like I’m far away, but I put that down to exhaustion.
DOCTOR: “Okay, mild tension headaches, occasional ringing in the ears related to work noise, and a feeling of disconnection you attribute to exhaustion. That’s all helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, proceed. I hope it won’t be too… intrusive. I am rather tall, if that makes things more difficult.
DOCTOR: “Not at all, Lilyanna. I'm accustomed to patients of all sizes. Alright. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a neurological exam to assess your balance, coordination, and reflexes. It involves a few simple tests – following my finger with your eyes, walking a straight line, and things like that. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Walking a straight line… I confess, that doesn’t fill me with confidence, given my current predicament. But yes, please, proceed. I’ll do my best. I just hope I don’t… fall. Is there a soft surface nearby, just in case?
DOCTOR: “We absolutely have safety measures in place, Lilyanna. There’s a chair right here for you to hold onto if you need it, and I’ll be right beside you. It’s unlikely you’ll fall, but we’ll be prepared. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128/82, heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let's check your balance. Can you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here I am. Please, tell me what to do. I’ll try my best, but I’m afraid my balance isn’t what it once was. Perhaps we should skip the walking altogether? Just a suggestion.
DOCTOR: “We can modify the tests if needed, Lilyanna. Let’s start with something simple. Can you close your eyes and stand still for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Alright… here I am. Thirty seconds… it feels much longer already. I… I don’t think I’m very steady. Is it alright if I keep one hand on the chair? I don't want to risk falling.
DOCTOR: “Yes, absolutely, keep your hand on the chair. That’s perfectly fine. Okay, that’s good. You exhibited some sway, and needed to hold onto the chair for stability. Now, let’s try the Romberg test. Can you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes again?
PATIENT: With my feet together? Oh dear… I’m not sure I can manage that safely, Doctor. I’m quite tall, and my center of gravity is… rather high. I’m afraid I’m going to fall. Perhaps we could skip that test altogether? Or modify it significantly? I truly don’t want to risk injury.
DOCTOR: “You are right to express your concerns, Lilyanna. Safety is our priority. We can absolutely modify the test or skip it altogether. Let’s skip the Romberg test for now. Instead, let’s check your reflexes. Can you sit back down for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Reflexes… that sounds… less hazardous. Please, proceed. I do appreciate you being so understanding, Doctor. I’m not usually this… unsteady. It’s rather unnerving, and I’m afraid I’m being a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: “You are not a bother at all, Lilyanna. It’s my job to assess what’s going on and ensure your safety. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to quickly check your range of motion in your joints. Can you bend forward and touch your toes, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I’m not terribly flexible, I’m afraid. Years of physical work haven’t been kind to my lower back. I can bend forward… a little. There. Is that sufficient? I don’t want to aggravate anything. It’s a little… stiff.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly fine, Lilyanna. No need to push yourself. Okay, I think that’s enough for the physical exam for now. Everything appears normal, but the unsteadiness and your report of needing to hold onto the chair for balance are concerning. Do you have any recent blood work results we can review?
PATIENT: Blood work… hmm. I had a check-up with my primary care physician about six months ago, I believe. It was… routine. Everything was normal then, as far as I recall. I don’t believe I’ve had any blood work since. I can certainly request the records to be sent over, if that would be helpful? I’m afraid I don’t keep copies myself.
DOCTOR: “That would be very helpful, Lilyanna. Please, feel free to have those records sent over whenever you have a chance. In the meantime, given your unsteadiness and the normal findings on the physical exam, I’m going to recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out any underlying neurological causes. It will allow us to visualize the brain and look for any abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… of my brain? Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, could it be something else? Perhaps… inner ear problems? Or… low blood pressure? I’m afraid I’m a bit apprehensive about… about having my brain scanned. What exactly does it involve? And… is it painful?
DOCTOR: “I understand your apprehension, Lilyanna. An MRI is a very sensitive imaging test, and it’s true it can sometimes be a bit unsettling. However, it's the best way to rule out any serious underlying causes for your unsteadiness. We want to be thorough. It's not usually painful. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s quite noisy, so we’ll provide you with earplugs or headphones. You’ll need to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry, and let us know if you have any metal implants. While inner ear problems and low blood pressure can cause unsteadiness, your symptoms and the normal findings on the exam make those less likely. But we need to rule out more serious causes first, just to be sure. Would you like me to explain the potential reasons for ordering the MRI in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explaining it in more detail would be… helpful. I’m afraid I don’t understand much about brains or… magnets. What exactly are we looking for? And… what if something is wrong? I’m… rather worried, to be honest. I just want to feel steady again.
DOCTOR: “I understand your worry, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. We’re looking for any abnormalities in the brain that could be causing your unsteadiness. This could include things like small strokes, tumors, or inflammation. But please, try not to jump to conclusions. Most likely, it will be something benign, and the MRI will simply give us peace of mind. The MRI will help us determine if there’s a structural issue, or if your unsteadiness could be caused by something else, like a vestibular problem – that's an issue with the balance system in your inner ear. If we find something, we'll discuss the best course of treatment. If it’s a vestibular problem, we can refer you to an ENT specialist for further evaluation and therapy. We'll schedule the MRI for as soon as possible, and I'll personally review the results with you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could increase your risk of falling, such as climbing ladders or operating heavy machinery. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Avoiding activities that could increase my risk of falling… certainly. I’ll need to inform my supervisor at the rig, I suppose. And… I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible. It’s just… the thought of being in that machine… it’s a little frightening. But I understand it’s necessary. Doctor… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I be able to drive myself home after the MRI? I don’t want to trouble anyone.
DOCTOR: “You're right to ask about the driving, Lilyanna. It's a good question. The MRI itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the results, it typically takes a few days for the radiologist to review the images and send a report. I'll call you as soon as I have them. You shouldn't drive yourself home after the MRI, just as a precaution. Sometimes the contrast dye can cause temporary drowsiness. It's best to have someone drive you, or take a taxi or ride-sharing service. We can also help arrange transportation if needed. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, vision changes, or weakness, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and explained everything very thoroughly. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible, and arrange for transportation. And I’ll contact you immediately if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your understanding, and your reassurance.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI. And remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
