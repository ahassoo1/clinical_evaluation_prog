DOCTOR: Good morning, Moshe. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Renzi. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, it’s this…sleepiness, really. Even though I’m using the machine every night, like I’m supposed to. It just doesn’t feel like it’s doing enough. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, sleepiness despite using the machine… I understand. That is frustrating. Let's try to figure out what’s going on. When did you start noticing this sleepiness, even with the machine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… maybe three or four months now? I started the machine – well, the doctor before you, Dr. Eldridge, started me on it about six months ago. It was good for the first couple of months, definitely helped with the snoring and how I felt in the mornings. But then, slowly, I started feeling tired during the day again. Not awful, but enough to notice. Enough to… well, sometimes I’ll doze off a bit in my chair after lunch, you know? It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see Dr. Eldridge started you on CPAP therapy about six months ago. And you’re saying the benefit decreased after a couple of months. That's helpful to know. So, it sounds like it was initially effective, but the effectiveness has waned. Do you ever notice any difference in how you feel on days you don't use the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Those days are…rough. A lot more tired, obviously. My wife – she’s thankfully very understanding – she always knows when I haven’t used it. She says my snoring is back, and I’m just generally more grumpy. Not intentionally, mind you! It’s just… harder to get going. And concentrating is difficult. It's like trying to see through a fog, sometimes. So yes, definitely a difference. A big difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a clearer picture. So, the CPAP is making a noticeable difference when you do use it, and the symptoms return when you don't. That’s good information. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really… well, sometimes my mouth feels a little dry in the morning. And the mask… it can be a bit uncomfortable sometimes, especially if I move around a lot in my sleep. But those aren't really symptoms, are they? Just… annoyances. Nothing serious, I don't think. My wife says I don’t stop moving much, actually! She worries I'm not getting a good seal with the mask. Though, I've tried different sizes, you know?
DOCTOR: Those are helpful things to know, Moshe. Dry mouth can be a symptom related to the CPAP, and mask discomfort and seal issues are common. We definitely want to address those. And the seal is very important. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure's been a little high for years, I suppose. The doctor puts me on medication for it, and it seems to keep it in check. Other than that… nothing major. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that's it, really. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I try to eat a fairly healthy diet, mostly, and I get a little bit of exercise when I can. Though, being 83, it’s not as easy as it used to be!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Moshe. So, managed hypertension, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. They get a bit creaky, you know? It's an anti-inflammatory. Ibuprofen, usually. Nothing regularly, though. Just when they bother me. Oh, and a multivitamin every morning. My daughter insists on that one!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No allergies at all. Never had any trouble with that. My wife always checks, of course, before I try anything new, just in case. She's very cautious, which is probably a good thing. I'm lucky to have her, really.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Moshe. No known allergies is very helpful. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had heart problems later in life. High blood pressure too, come to think of it. And my mother, she had arthritis. Badly, in her hands and knees. My sister, she’s still living, thankfully, and she's got diabetes. But other than that… nothing major that I can think of. Mostly just the usual things, you know? Things that people get as they get older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems and hypertension in your father, arthritis in your mother, and diabetes in your sister. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly does that mean, Doctor? I'm retired, if that’s what you’re asking. I used to be a professor – Ethnic and Cultural Studies, mostly. Taught at the university for… oh, goodness, almost forty years! Now, I mostly spend my time reading, gardening a little, and trying to keep up with my grandchildren. They keep me young, that’s for sure!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Moshe. It sounds like you’ve lived a very full life! I was asking about things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or if you’ve ever used any recreational drugs, but it sounds like you have a very healthy lifestyle. And gardening is excellent exercise! Now, I think it's time for a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just want to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no smoking, never. And alcohol… just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very occasionally. And drugs? Heavens, no! A professor, you know! Yes, a physical exam sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve got nothing to hide! Just…be gentle with my knees, if you can, alright? They’re a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Moshe. I’ll be very gentle. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, which we often hear with age, nothing concerning at this time. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your throat looks a little red, but no significant inflammation. Your tonsils are normal. There’s some mild tenderness here, but nothing alarming. Now, let's check your oxygen saturation. 95%, that’s good. Now, if you could just open your mouth wide and say “Ahhh”…
PATIENT: Ahhh… Is that alright, Doctor? It feels a bit silly, doesn't it? I haven't had a doctor look down my throat like that in years! Hopefully everything looks okay. I just want to get this sleepiness sorted out, it’s making it difficult to enjoy my retirement. My grandchildren are always asking me to play with them, but I’m just too tired.
DOCTOR: Everything looks okay, Moshe. A little redness, but nothing significant to worry about. Now, given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like the CPAP isn't providing optimal therapy. The sleepiness, the dry mouth, and the potential for a poor mask seal are all things we need to address. We'll start with a CPAP mask fitting to ensure you have the right size and type for your face. We can also adjust the pressure settings to see if that helps. It's possible the pressure is too low or too high. We can also explore the possibility of a humidifier to help with the dry mouth. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable indeed. I'm happy to try anything that might help. A mask fitting sounds good, maybe I've just been using the wrong one all this time. And adjusting the pressure… that makes sense too. I just want to be able to enjoy my life again, you know? Play with my grandchildren, read my books, maybe even travel a little. It’s frustrating feeling tired all the time. So yes, let's start with the mask fitting. What do we need to do?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll have our respiratory therapist, Sarah, come in and do a thorough mask fitting. She'll measure your face and try several different masks to find the best fit and seal. She’ll also discuss the different types of masks available – nasal pillows, nasal masks, full face masks – and help you determine which one is most comfortable for you. She’ll also show you how to properly clean and maintain your mask. She'll also make sure the pressure settings are optimal. It may take some time to find the right combination, but we'll work through it together. Sarah should be with you shortly. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I'm just glad you're taking this seriously and trying to help me. Honestly, sometimes I feel like the doctors just brush it off as getting old. So, thank you. I'll be patient and work with Sarah to find the right mask. Just let me know if you think of anything else I should be aware of while I'm waiting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Moshe. It's my job to listen and help you feel your best, and I completely understand your frustration. It's important to address these concerns and not just dismiss them. Just try to relax, and Sarah will take good care of you. One thing: If you experience any significant air leaks or discomfort with a new mask, don’t hesitate to call the office. We can always adjust the fitting or try a different size. Also, if your sleepiness worsens or you start experiencing any other symptoms, please let us know immediately. Do you have any further questions before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel much better knowing that we’re going to work together to find a solution. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Thank you again, Doctor Renzi. I feel quite optimistic now. Hopefully, I'll be back to playing with my grandchildren soon! .
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Moshe. I'm glad I could help. We'll do everything we can to get you back to enjoying time with your grandchildren. Sarah should be with you in just a moment. .
