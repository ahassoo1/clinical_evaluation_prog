DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the masks… and other things they want us to wear. I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, or… well, some other arrangement. I have some difficulties with them.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're having some trouble with the requirements at your workplace regarding masks and other protective gear. That's perfectly alright, we can certainly discuss that. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about these difficulties you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a feeling of being restricted, mostly. A tightness in my chest, a bit of panic, actually, when I have something covering my face for too long. It’s not… a comfortable sensation, and it interferes with my breathing a bit. I work with people, you see, and I need to be calm and focused to do my job properly. It’s hard to be those things when I’m feeling… closed in. It’s not something I’ve ever really experienced before, this started when the rules changed at work. I’ve tried different kinds of masks, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety and physical discomfort related to wearing masks, and that it's impacting your ability to focus at work. That's certainly concerning, and we want to get to the bottom of this. To clarify, when you say it interferes with your breathing, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is a concern, yes. It’s not that I can’t breathe, exactly. It’s more like… my breaths become very short and shallow. And I find myself focusing on taking the next breath, rather than on the person I’m assisting. I work with vulnerable individuals, you see, and I need to be fully present and attentive. It’s a distracting sensation. It feels like my chest is… constricted, even when I’m trying to take slow, deep breaths. It’s not painful, but it's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so short, shallow breaths, a feeling of constriction, and increased focus on the act of breathing itself, making it difficult to concentrate. That’s very helpful. And you mentioned this started when the rules changed at work – was there a specific event or change that triggered this, or was it more gradual?
PATIENT: It was fairly sudden, Doctor. The clinic I work at – it's a smaller place, you see – we hadn’t been requiring masks consistently before. Then, about a month ago, there was a bit of a local outbreak of something… a new strain of the flu, I believe. So, management made the decision to enforce the mask rule, full-time. And that's when the difficulty started. It wasn’t a gradual thing. One day, I was fine, and the next day, I was feeling… overwhelmed just putting the mask on.
DOCTOR: I see. A fairly abrupt onset coinciding with the new mask policy and the local outbreak. That's important information. Have you had any similar feelings or experiences with any other types of restrictive clothing or situations – perhaps feeling confined in small spaces, or having trouble with tight collars, things like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… not that I can recall, actually. I’ve never been particularly bothered by tight clothing or small spaces. I enjoy spending time outdoors, in open areas. I suppose I prefer… freedom of movement. But I've never felt any panic or restriction from something like a tight collar or being in a small room. This is… unique to the masks, I believe. It's purely related to having something over my face.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be specifically related to the sensation of something covering your face. And you mentioned working with vulnerable individuals – what is your role at the clinic, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am a Protective Service Worker. It’s… a bit of everything, really. I assist patients with daily living tasks, provide emotional support, help with appointments, and ensure their overall well-being. I also act as a liaison between the patients, their families, and the medical staff. It requires a great deal of… presence, as I said before. And communication. It’s difficult to be present and communicative when I’m preoccupied with my breathing.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds like a very demanding and important role, requiring you to be fully engaged and attentive. It makes sense that being distracted by these feelings would be detrimental to your ability to perform your duties effectively. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety, panic disorder, or any other mental health condition?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I’ve always considered myself a fairly… stable individual. I’ve never sought any mental health treatment, and I’ve never been prescribed any medication for anxiety or depression. I’ve always been able to manage stress effectively through… routine and spending time outdoors, as I said. This is… a new experience for me, as you can imagine. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel unsettled when experiencing something new and unexpected. And it’s good to know you haven’t had any previous history of anxiety or panic. Have you ever experienced any significant trauma or stressful life events that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Not that I can recall, Doctor. I’ve had a… reasonably peaceful life, all things considered. I grew up on the reservation, surrounded by family and community. There were… hardships, of course, as there are for many people, but nothing that I would consider traumatic. I served in the military for a time, but I did not experience any combat or… significant stress during my service. I’ve always been able to adapt to new situations and cope with challenges effectively. This… feeling is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No history of trauma or significant stress. Now, let’s talk about your past surgical history, if any. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not had any surgeries. I’ve always been fortunate enough to maintain good health, and I’ve never required any surgical interventions. I’ve had the usual childhood vaccinations, and I’ve had a few minor injuries over the years, but nothing that required hospitalization or surgical treatment.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit difficult, Doctor. My family history… it’s not well-documented, I’m afraid. Many of my relatives… their medical records weren’t kept, or they weren’t accessible. There is a history of… heart trouble on my mother’s side, I believe. And some instances of diabetes. But beyond that, I don’t have much information to share. It’s a common situation for families from the reservation, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly alright, and it's common. We'll work with what information we have. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I might have a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but I do not drink regularly. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I've always been a fairly… health-conscious individual, and I prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It's important to me, both for myself and for my work. I need to be clear-headed and alert at all times.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any known allergies. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions to medications, food, or anything else. I can eat whatever I want, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions to any medications I’ve been prescribed in the past.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that thorough information, Mr. Knabenshue. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just generally assess your overall well-being. We can also do a brief mental status check just to get a baseline. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I am happy to cooperate in any way that might be helpful. I understand the need for a thorough examination, and I am confident that you will be able to determine the cause of my difficulties. Please proceed as you see fit. I’ll do my best to remain still and follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. That's within the normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and I don’t hear any murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally, with no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to ask you to take a few deep breaths while I listen again. Still clear. Based on the physical exam alone, there’s nothing immediately apparent that would explain your difficulties. It doesn’t seem to be a respiratory issue. This sounds more like a psychological response to the feeling of being restricted by the mask. However, to rule out anything else, I’d like to order a basic blood test, just to check your oxygen levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. A blood test seems like a prudent step, and I am happy to comply. It’s good to know you’re considering all possibilities. Yes, please proceed with the blood test. I trust your judgment. It’s reassuring to know that everything sounds normal, but I’m happy to have further confirmation. What is involved with the test? Will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. We’ll do a standard Complete Blood Count to check your red and white blood cells, and a basic metabolic panel to look at your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We'll also check your oxygen saturation levels. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the test. That means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water, but that’s it. The lab will provide you with specific instructions when they schedule the appointment. While we wait for the blood test results, I recommend we explore some strategies to manage your anxiety and discomfort. Have you ever considered relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation?
PATIENT: I have heard of those techniques, Doctor, but I have never actively practiced them. I’ve always found that simply spending time outdoors, in a quiet setting, is sufficient to calm my nerves and clear my head. I suppose I’ve never felt the need for more… structured methods. However, I am open to trying them, if you believe they might be helpful. I’m willing to explore any avenue that could alleviate my difficulties. Perhaps you could suggest some resources or exercises that I could practice at home?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. There are many resources available. I can provide you with a pamphlet on deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. There are also several apps, like Calm and Headspace, that offer guided meditations. They can be quite helpful, especially when you're first starting out. Here's a handout with some basic deep breathing techniques you can try. We can also discuss cognitive behavioral therapy if these techniques don’t provide enough relief. CBT can help you identify and challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs that are contributing to your anxiety. However, let’s start with the breathing exercises and see how those work for you. In the meantime, and until we get the blood test results, I would recommend you avoid wearing masks if it's causing you significant distress. We don't want to exacerbate your anxiety. Do you think your workplace would be amenable to a temporary accommodation, perhaps allowing you to maintain social distancing or wear a face shield instead?
PATIENT: That is… a thoughtful suggestion, Doctor. I appreciate your consideration of my well-being. I believe my supervisor would be willing to discuss a temporary accommodation, at least. I have a good working relationship with her. She is understanding and concerned for the safety of all employees. I will explain the situation to her, and I am confident that we can find a suitable arrangement. Perhaps a face shield would be a reasonable compromise. It provides some protection without completely restricting my breathing. I will speak with her first thing tomorrow morning. Thank you for providing the handout, as well. I will review it carefully and begin practicing the deep breathing exercises tonight. I appreciate your thoroughness and your compassionate approach.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That sounds like a good plan. Maintaining open communication with your supervisor is key. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. To recap, we’ve ordered a basic blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ve discussed relaxation techniques, and I’ve provided you with a handout on deep breathing exercises. And we’ve agreed that you’ll discuss a temporary accommodation with your supervisor. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the blood test results are available, to discuss those results and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I appreciate your comprehensive approach, and I am grateful for your assistance. I feel much more confident now, knowing that we are taking a proactive approach to address my difficulties. I will contact the lab to schedule the blood test, and I will reach out to my supervisor tomorrow morning. I will also begin practicing the deep breathing exercises tonight. Thank you again for your time and your compassionate care. I look forward to our follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I should do or be aware of before then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. No, I don’t think there's anything else at this point. Just try to remain calm, practice the breathing exercises, and keep me informed of any changes in your symptoms. If you experience any sudden or severe anxiety, or if you have any difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you at our follow-up appointment. Have a good evening, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will certainly do that. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and your clear instructions. I will keep you informed of my progress, and I will not hesitate to contact you if I have any concerns. Have a good evening as well, Doctor.
