DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Mutnick, is it? Yes, well… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter practically dragged me here. She worries too much, that one. Said I ought to… get checked out. Just a general look-see, I suppose. I feel fine, mostly. Though my knees do ache sometimes. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: "Old age," you say. A rather… imprecise diagnosis, Ms. Calvery. While I appreciate your… optimism, we strive for a bit more specificity here. Your daughter brought you in for a “general look-see,” you say?
PATIENT: Specificity? Honestly. My daughter gets these ideas from the internet, you know. Always reading about things. She said something about… preventative care. That’s what she called it. I just figured I’d humour her. It's not like I want to be poked and prodded, Doctor. I've lived a long life, and frankly, I'm not expecting any surprises at this point. Though, if you must know, she was particularly concerned about my… memory. Which is just ridiculous. I remember perfectly well where I put my purse yesterday. Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Preventative care.” Right. And your daughter’s concern is your memory, specifically?
PATIENT: Well, she says so. She keeps catching me… misplacing things, I suppose. Or forgetting what I went into the store for. But honestly, who doesn’t do that? I’m 64 years old! It’s perfectly normal. It’s not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. Honestly, the fuss she's making... it's a bit much. I’ve always been a very… practical woman. I don't need a doctor telling me what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Practical, you say. Very well. Let's establish a baseline, then, shall we?
PATIENT: Baseline? What's that supposed to be? Some sort of… test? Look, Doctor, I really don't have time for a lot of fuss. I have a pot roast in the slow cooker, you know. It needs checking on. Are you going to poke and prod me or what? Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: A pot roast, you say. Efficiency is admirable, Ms. Calvery. Very well. I will perform a brief physical examination, and then we will proceed. It will be… limited. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Goodness, no. I eat like a horse, always have. Though, I suppose I haven’t been cooking as much lately. My daughter’s been bringing over a lot of… healthy things. Salads and… fish. It’s all very bland, honestly. I prefer a good, hearty meal. You know, meat and potatoes. Though, I’ve been a little tired lately, now that you mention it. But who isn’t? Life is tiring.
DOCTOR: Tired, you say. And you’ve noticed no other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think… My knees ache, as I said. And sometimes I have a little trouble… remembering names. Not important names, mind you. Just… people at the grocery store, things like that. And I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, but that’s probably just because I’m not as young as I used to be. Nothing to worry about, really. I’m sure it’s all just… old age. Is that what this is about? You’re going to tell me I’m getting old?
DOCTOR: “Old age” is a… simplification, Ms. Calvery. Now, let's proceed with a basic examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs. And then we'll check your reflexes. I assure you, it will be brief.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But don’t go poking around too much, Doctor. I don’t like being touched. And if I start feeling faint, you’ll be the one to blame. Honestly, the things I do for that daughter of mine…
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, Ms. Calvery. And I detect a slight wheezing in your lower lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… deeper. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Ow! That was a bit… abrupt, wasn’t it? And honestly, I’ve always had weak reflexes. I wasn't very athletic as a child. More of a bookworm, you see. Is that it? Can I sit up now? I'm starting to feel a bit… exposed. And frankly, all this poking and prodding isn’t telling me anything I didn't already know. My knees ache, I get tired easily, and my daughter worries too much.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished bilaterally. As expected. Very well. Given your… comprehensive self-assessment and your daughter’s concerns, I recommend a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying deficiencies. And a chest X-ray, to investigate the wheezing. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Calvery. Nothing to be alarmed about. We simply need to have a baseline for future comparison. Would you like me to order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Baseline, baseline, baseline… honestly. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness, but I really don’t see the point. I feel fine. Mostly. And all this testing sounds expensive. My Medicare only covers so much, you know. Alright, fine. If it’ll get my daughter off my back, order the tests. But if anything comes back abnormal, I want a full explanation. No medical jargon, understand? I want it explained to me in plain English. And I expect a quick turnaround time. I don’t want to spend all week worrying about it. Now, can I finally get dressed? This paper gown is terribly drafty.
DOCTOR: Very well. I've ordered the blood panel and the chest X-ray. Results should be available within five business days. You may get dressed, Ms. Calvery. I will review the results and contact your daughter to schedule a follow-up appointment. I trust she will be able to translate the medical terminology for you if necessary. Next patient.
PATIENT: Honestly! The nerve of some people. Translate the medical terminology… as if I’m incapable of understanding a simple explanation. Fine. Just… call my daughter. I’m sure she'll be thrilled. And don't expect me to come back willingly. Honestly, the whole thing was a waste of time. .
