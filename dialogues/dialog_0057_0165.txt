DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It's… a fever, keeps comin’ back. Been happenin’ for a bit now, and it’s gettin’ old, frankly. I just wanna figure out what’s goin’ on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, good to meet you too. A recurring fever… that is frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts with just feelin’ kinda chilly, then real quick I’m hot, you know? Sweatin’, achin’… feels like the flu, but not quite. It lasts maybe a day, sometimes two, then it’s gone for a week or so, then… bam, it's back. Happens maybe once a month now. I don't know what triggers it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when it comes back, is it always similar in how it feels, or does it change at all?
PATIENT: It’s pretty much the same, yeah. Chills, achy, tired. Sometimes my head hurts a little bit, but not always. And I haven’t been coughin’ or nothin’ like that. Just… hot and miserable for a day. I haven’t taken my temperature, if that matters. I usually just try to sleep it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Not having a cough is good. Sleeping it off works sometimes, but we still want to figure out why this is happening. Have you noticed anything that seems to precede the fever – anything unusual you’ve been doing or exposed to before it starts?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… nothin’ really stands out. Work’s been pretty normal. I’m a chiropractor, so I'm around people all day, but I haven’t had anyone sick come in that I know of. I did some gardenin’ last week, cleared out a patch of weeds… maybe somethin’ from that? I dunno. Honestly, Doctor, I'm stumped.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening is something to keep in mind. And you haven't traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't left the city in… oh, must be a year now. My wife and I talk about it, but we haven’t actually gone anywhere. Mostly just work and home, you know? I’m not a big traveler, never have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox… but nothin’ serious. I broke my wrist once, a long time ago. Other than that, pretty healthy, knock on wood. I haven’t really been to a doctor much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the wrist, when I was a kid. They set it and put a cast on it. Wasn’t a big deal. No other surgeries, never needed ‘em. I’m pretty careful, I guess. Mostly just try to stay active and eat okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. My wife always asks, and I always say no. She worries, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Sometimes I'll take somethin’ for a headache, but that’s about it. Mostly just water and rest when I’m feelin’ bad. I prefer natural remedies, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother had… arthritis, maybe? She was always complainin’ about her joints achin’. Other than that, nothin’ really stands out. My brother’s healthy as a horse, and my sister’s okay too, as far as I know. We don’t talk much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I'm married, been with my wife, Elena, for… oh, forty years now. Wonderful woman. We have two grown kids, both married with kids of their own. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a little, but I cut back years ago. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. I live here in the city, always have. Work keeps me busy, and spend a lot of time with the grandkids when I can. It's a pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information, thank you. Now, to help me understand what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just want this figured out, so let's get to it. I got appointments later today, so if we could keep it quick, I’d appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll be as quick as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath in for me, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: There. Is that good? Everything sounds alright to me, but I ain’t a doctor. Just tryin’ to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm not hearing anything unusual at this time. Now, I'm going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your temperature is 100.2 Fahrenheit. Your pulse is 88 and your blood pressure is 130/80. Let me also take a look at your throat and listen to your abdomen. Your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. I'll also check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes feel normal as well. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope. That doesn’t hurt. Everything feels… normal, you know? Like I said, it’s just a fever that comes and goes. I don’t understand it. It's just… frustrating. I got people to see, work to do. This is slowin’ me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Clide. Everything does seem normal with the physical exam, which is good. However, the recurring fever is concerning. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. There are several possibilities, including a viral infection, an underlying inflammatory condition, or even something less common. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count will help us look for signs of infection or inflammation. We should also check your electrolytes and kidney function. We can also test for some common viral infections. Do you have any insurance that would help cover these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no insurance. Never really needed it before. Been lucky, I guess. But these tests… how much are we talkin’ about? I got a budget to stick to, you know? I can pay somethin’, but I don’t wanna get into debt over this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Clide. That's a valid concern. Unfortunately, without insurance, the tests can be expensive. Let me check the approximate costs for you. A CBC, electrolytes, and a basic viral panel will be around $300-$400 total. We can prioritize the CBC and electrolytes first, which are the most essential, at around $150-$200. If those results come back abnormal, then we can consider the viral panel. Would that be feasible for you?
PATIENT: $200… alright, I can swing that. Not thrilled about it, but I need to know what’s goin’ on. So CBC and electrolytes, right? That’s it for now? Just get it done, Doctor. The sooner I know, the sooner I can get back to normal. Where do I go for these tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. CBC and electrolytes it is. There's a lab just down the street, at 123 Main Street. I'll print out a lab requisition for you with all the necessary information. They’re open until 5:00 PM today. Once the results are back, which usually takes 24-48 hours, you can have them faxed directly to my office – the fax number is on the form. Or you can call them to get the results and then give me a call. Once I have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. 123 Main Street, right. I’ll get it done today, first thing. Fax ‘em to your office. I’m good with that. Alright, Doctor. Thanks for your time. Hopefully, we can figure this out soon. I got people dependin’ on me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clide. I understand. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly as well. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You too.
