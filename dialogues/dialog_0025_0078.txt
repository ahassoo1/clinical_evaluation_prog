DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fourney. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a reset. Or a jumpstart, maybe? I’m just… not myself lately. I feel tired, and things aren’t as easy as they used to be. It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: “A reset,” hmm. That’s… vague, Ms. Pitzel. A lot of people feel that way. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Sorry. It’s just… where do I begin? My energy levels are very low. I used to be able to work all day, and then come home and still have energy for things. Now, I find myself needing naps, and even then I don’t feel fully rested. And… I’m forgetting things. Little things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was going to say mid-sentence… nothing major, but it's concerning. It feels like my brain isn't quite as sharp as it once was. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Pitzel. Low energy and some memory issues… We'll get to the bottom of this. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It wasn’t sudden, more… gradual. I’d say, probably around six months ago? Maybe a little longer. At first, I just thought I was getting older, you know? But it’s been… persistent. It hasn’t gotten better, certainly. And honestly, the last few weeks it feels like it’s maybe even a little worse. I haven’t been sleeping well either, which I suspect is connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, gradually worsening, with recent increased fatigue and trouble sleeping. And you said the memory issues are relatively minor – can you give me an example of something you've forgotten recently?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Just yesterday, I was making dinner for my husband, and I completely forgot what spice I needed mid-recipe. I had all the ingredients laid out, was following the instructions… and just… blank. I knew something was missing, but couldn't recall what it was. He had to remind me. It’s things like that, small everyday things. And sometimes names, too. Not of close family, but… acquaintances. It's embarrassing, really. I don’t want to be that person.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll explore this further. Now, let’s talk about other things going on in your life. Are you experiencing any stress?
PATIENT: Stress… yes, a bit. My daughter is getting married next year, which is wonderful, of course, but the planning is… a lot. And my husband's health hasn't been the best lately, which is a worry. Nothing serious, thankfully, just… requires a lot of appointments and keeping track of things. So, yes, there's some stress. I wouldn’t say it’s overwhelming, but it's there, constantly in the background. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Wedding planning and a husband with health concerns… that is a lot to manage. Now, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I’ve had my annual check-ups, and everything has always been normal. I do take a daily vitamin, just a standard multivitamin. And I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago, but that’s it. No other surgeries or serious illnesses. I have Medicare, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, just a daily multivitamin and a hysterectomy fifteen years ago. Medicare is noted. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any reactions to medications in the past. I’ve taken antibiotics, pain relievers… the usual things. Never had any problems. I do get mosquito bites, of course, but that’s just an annoyance, not an allergy. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had… dementia, later in life. It was very sad. She was in her eighties when it started, I think. My father had high blood pressure, but otherwise, they were both fairly healthy. I don’t know of any other major illnesses that run in the family, honestly. It wasn't something we talked about much. Is that helpful? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: It is. Dementia in your mother is important to note. Alright. And finally, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. I’ve never smoked. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once or twice a month, but that’s it. And no, absolutely no recreational drugs. I’ve never been interested in those. I’m a pretty simple person, really. I enjoy gardening and spending time with my family. I’m not one for… excitement.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: If you don’t mind, please sit up here, and I’ll take a listen to your heart and lungs as well. Then we'll do a quick neurological exam – just checking your reflexes and balance.
PATIENT: Certainly. Sounds good. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m a little nervous, I must admit, but I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: “Heart sounds are normal. No murmurs or abnormal rhythms.” I listen to her lungs. “Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles.” “Now, let's check your reflexes.” I lightly tap her knees with a reflex hammer. “Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally – normal.” I ask her to close her eyes and touch her nose with her finger. “Good. Now, walk in a straight line for me.” I observe her gait. “Balance appears stable.” “Neurological exam is unremarkable. Everything appears normal so far.”
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, to hear. Thank you, Doctor. So, what do you think is going on? Is it something serious? I'm a little worried about my mother, and… well, I'd like to know what we're dealing with, if possible. Perhaps some blood tests?
DOCTOR: “Given your symptoms – fatigue, memory issues, and recent sleep disturbance – and your family history, I do think some blood tests are warranted. We’ll check a complete blood count to rule out anemia or infection, a thyroid panel to see if your thyroid is functioning properly, and Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D levels, as deficiencies can cause similar symptoms. We should also check a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and blood sugar.” “I’m also going to order a lipid panel, just to get a full picture of your cholesterol levels.” “While these tests won’t give us a definitive diagnosis immediately, they’ll help us rule out common causes and guide further investigation if needed. I also want to mention that, given the memory concerns, it would be prudent to discuss a cognitive screening test. It’s a simple test, and it can help me assess your current cognitive function and see if any further neuropsychological evaluation is needed.”
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Thank you, Doctor. A cognitive screening test… that sounds a little scary, to be honest. But if you think it's best, I trust your judgment. I’d rather know sooner than later, I suppose. Will the blood tests require a fasting period? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a trip planned next month, and I’d like to know if that might affect things.
DOCTOR: “I understand your apprehension about the cognitive screening, Ms. Pitzel. It's a very simple test, and it doesn't mean anything is necessarily wrong. It’s just a baseline assessment, and it’s better to have that information now. We can schedule it for another appointment if you prefer, after we get the blood test results.” “Yes, the blood tests do require a 12-hour fast. So, nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight. Just water is okay. As for the results, it typically takes about a week to get them back from the lab. So, you should have them before your trip next month. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. If anything looks concerning, we'll contact you sooner.” “I’ll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the tests. And I’ll have my nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for you before you leave today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. You’ve been very helpful and… reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. A lab requisition form and a follow-up appointment… I think I have everything. I feel a little better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any vitamins I should avoid, or activities I should be focusing on? Perhaps some brain games?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a bit. In the meantime, I wouldn’t worry too much about avoiding specific vitamins. Continue taking your daily multivitamin as usual. And yes, you’re right – brain games are a good idea! Things like crosswords, Sudoku, reading, or anything that keeps your mind active can be beneficial. Most importantly, focus on getting enough sleep – aim for 7-8 hours a night. And try to manage your stress levels – perhaps try some relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. These aren’t necessarily cures, but they can definitely improve your overall well-being." "Here's a handout with some resources on stress management techniques. It also includes some tips on improving sleep hygiene. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or if you develop any new concerns, don't hesitate to contact my office." “Do you have any other questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been incredibly thorough, Doctor Fourney. I really appreciate your time and expertise. I feel much better equipped to face this, whatever it may be. Thank you again. I suppose I’ll see you next week then, once the results are back?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. Yes, we’ll schedule that follow-up appointment for next week. My nurse will contact you to confirm the date and time. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you soon.” “Have a good day, Ms. Pitzel.”
