DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my heart. It feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not normal fast, you know? Like… flutters. It scares my wife. It happens… not all the time. Sometimes when I work.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fluttering” – I understand. That can definitely be unsettling, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. When you say “when you work,” can you tell me a bit more about what kind of work you do?
PATIENT: I work with… machines. Big machines. They make… things. Chemicals, mostly. I check them, make sure they are okay. I open valves, read numbers… I turn things on and off. It’s… loud. And hot. Sometimes I have to lift heavy things too. It’s… a factory. Not a clean factory.
DOCTOR: Right, a factory environment. That gives me a better picture. And when these “flutters” happen during work, are they directly related to a specific task – like when you’re lifting something, or opening a valve, or is it more random while you're there?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. I think… when I am busy. When I have to think a lot. Like… if something is wrong with the machine and I have to fix it. Or when the boss is watching. Not always, but… often. When I am calm, it's okay. When I am stressed… then it happens. I don't know why. My wife says it's the stress. She is always right.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Philipp. So it sounds like stress is a major factor. Have you noticed anything else that brings these feelings on, or makes them worse?
PATIENT: Let me think... Sometimes when I drink coffee. Not much coffee, just one cup. And… when I don’t sleep good. My job is… sometimes at night. If the machines break, I have to go in. Then I don’t sleep. And the flutters… they are worse then. Not every time, but… more often. My wife makes me chamomile tea. That helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coffee and lack of sleep seem to be triggers as well. Have you ever felt any other symptoms along with these palpitations – like dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or sweating?
PATIENT: Hmm… dizziness… sometimes. A little bit. Like I’m going to fall. But not always. And… sometimes I feel tired. Very tired. But I work hard. So maybe that’s normal. No chest pain. And… no sweating. Just… the fast beating. And the feeling like I can’t breathe good… just for a little bit. When the heart… flutters. It goes away quick. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and a brief feeling of shortness of breath with the palpitations. Have you ever had any testing done for this before – an EKG, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… I don’t know what that is. EKG? Is that… a machine? I just tell my wife when it happens. She says I worry too much. She took me to a doctor once, for my back. But… never for the heart. This is the first time. I don’t like doctors. But my wife… she made me come.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous testing. That's good to know. I understand you're not a fan of doctors, and that's perfectly alright. We’ll take things slowly. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. If it’s quick. I have to get back to work. My boss… he gets angry if I’m gone too long. But… if you need to listen… okay. Just… be quick, please? And… no needles? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, quick and no needles, I promise. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Your heart rate is a bit faster than usual, and your lungs sound clear. I’m also noting your weight is 119 pounds for a height of 171 cm… that’s a bit low, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, I am… small. I always have been. My wife… she worries I don’t eat enough. I eat rice, and fish. And bread. Sometimes meat. But… I work hard, and I don’t feel hungry all the time. Is the blood pressure… bad? Is that why my heart flutters?
DOCTOR: It's good your wife looks out for you. A bit low weight isn't necessarily a problem if you're feeling well, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. And yes, elevated blood pressure can contribute to palpitations, but it’s not the only cause. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG, as we discussed, to check the electrical activity of your heart. Also, a basic blood workup to check your thyroid levels, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. And finally, a urine analysis. These tests will help rule out other potential causes for your palpitations. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG… yes, okay. I remember you said that. And… blood work? That means needles? Oh… My wife is going to be happy about the tests. She wants me to know everything. If it’s important… yes, okay. Do what you need. But… the needles… can you be quick? And… not too deep? I don’t want to fall. Urine analysis… that sounds easy. I can do that. But the needles… please be careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and quick. We’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible for you. It’s a small prick, and it won’t take long. Okay, I’m ordering the EKG, blood work, and urine analysis now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take good care of you. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Two days… that’s good. Not too long. I hope they are quick with the needles. My wife… she will want to know everything, you said. Will they tell her? I want to be the one to tell her. She worries too much. So… I go to the lab now? Down the hall? Is it far? And… what do I need to tell them? Do I need to… take anything with me? Like… rice? Just in case?
DOCTOR: They won’t contact your wife directly, Philipp. All the results will be discussed with you first. You decide what you want to share with her. Yes, just head down the hall, and you’ll see the lab on your left. It’s not far at all. You don’t need to bring anything with you – no rice needed! Just tell them Dr. Hernandez sent you for an EKG, blood work, and a urine analysis. They’ll take care of everything. They may ask you if you’ve eaten anything recently, but that’s it. Do you have any other questions before you head down there?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… needles. And… not too deep. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You are… very kind. Even with the needles. I hope the tests… show nothing bad. My wife… she will be very happy if everything is okay. I will go now. Down the hall? Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp. You’re very welcome. I’ll be here if you have any questions after the tests. Just let the lab know you're here for the tests I ordered, and they’ll take good care of you. And don’t worry – we’ll figure out what’s going on. Have a good day. .
