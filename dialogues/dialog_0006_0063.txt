DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Gorga. It’s my back. It’s been… really bad lately. Worse than usual, I mean. It started maybe a week ago, just a little ache, but now… now it hurts to even sit up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. A week ago, started as a little ache, now making it difficult to sit. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly it hurts?
PATIENT: Well… it’s mostly right here. Not like, shooting down my leg, just… right in the middle. And it feels…stiff, you know? Like when you’ve been working in the garden all day, but I haven’t been in the garden. That's why I thought I should come. It's different than my normal aches.
DOCTOR: Middle of the lower back, stiffness… not radiating down the leg, and different than your usual aches. Okay. Any specific things that make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… everything kinda makes it worse, honestly. But…bending over is really bad. And trying to lift anything. Even just… a grocery bag. I try to take it easy, but… you know, life. It’s hard. It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: Bending, lifting… constant pain. Alright. And anything that makes it better at all?
PATIENT: Not much, really. Laying down helps a little, I guess. But I can't just lay all day. And… warm baths sometimes take the edge off, but it comes back pretty quick. I tried some of those patches, the ones you stick on your skin, but they didn’t do much either.
DOCTOR: Okay, laying down offers some relief, warm baths temporarily help. Patches didn't do much. Have you had back pain like this before, or is this new?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’ve had back pain for a long time. Years, really. But… it’s usually just a dull ache. This is… sharper. And doesn’t go away. Also… … you know when we talked before, when I first came to the clinic? About… the cancer? I was wondering if this could be… connected?
DOCTOR: Right. Yes, I remember. You're understandably concerned about a connection. It’s good you brought that up. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Let's do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I don’t want it to be something serious, you know? Especially… with everything else.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll get a better idea once we take a look. If you could just lie down on your stomach for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is there anything special I should do? Like, should I keep my arms a certain way? I always forget.
DOCTOR: No, just relax as much as possible. I'm just going to feel along your back, see where it's most tender. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that’s… tender. Not like a sharp pain, just… really uncomfortable. And a little bit to the left of your hand, too. That really hurts when you press there.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness along the spine, more on the left side. Now, can you try bending forward for me, just as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… not good. It hurts pretty bad when I bend like that. I can’t go very far. It feels like something is… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion, pain with forward bending. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No numbness or tingling. Just the pain in my back. It's… constant, like I said. But bending makes it so much worse. It’s just… frustrating. I want to be able to do things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back, possibly aggravated by previous issues. The pain radiating, or not radiating, down the leg is good. Given your history, we'll want to be cautious. I’m going to order some X-rays just to rule out anything more serious, like a fracture. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: X-rays? Yeah, okay. If that’s what you think is best. I just… I don’t want anything to be missed, you know? Especially with the…cancer. So, yeah. X-rays sound good. How long will that take? And will I get the results today?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The X-rays should only take a few minutes. We’ll send you to radiology right away. Usually, the radiologist gets back to us within a few hours, sometimes sooner. We’ll review the results as soon as they're available and call you with the findings. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and some anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain and inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… yeah, that sounds good. Anything to help. I hope it's nothing too bad. Just a strain, like you said. Will they call me no matter what the results are? Even if it’s… something I need to worry about? I don't want to have to chase them down.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will call you regardless of the results. If everything is normal, we'll let you know. If we see anything that requires further attention, we'll discuss the next steps with you immediately. I'll make a note in your chart to ensure the radiologist prioritizes your case and we get those results to you quickly. In the meantime, try to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we get you set up for the X-rays?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you listening. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I’m really tired of being sick.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand. We'll get those results back as soon as we can. Let’s get you over to radiology now. The technician will take good care of you. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. I’ll have the nurse escort you.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. .
