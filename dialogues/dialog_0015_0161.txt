DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Trestrail. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… getting this done, really. A friend mentioned PrEP, said it’s… preventative? For HIV. I figured I should look into it, you know? Better safe than sorry. I don’t really know much about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Preventative, yes. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a medication to reduce your risk of contracting HIV. It’s not a guarantee, mind you. Now, before we proceed, let's get a complete picture of your situation. Do you have any concerns about possible exposure to HIV?
PATIENT: Exposure… not really. Not that I know of. I’m single, haven’t been with anyone seriously in… well, a long time. But things change, you know? And it’s good to be prepared. My friend… he’s very careful, and he said this is just… smart. Is it a lot of pills? Because I already take a few things for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: "Smart" is a subjective term, Ms. Trefren. It's important to understand the rationale behind any medical intervention. We don’t prescribe medications lightly. It's one pill, taken daily. It’s crucial to be consistent for it to be effective. Now, let’s review your medical history. Do you mind if I ask about your past illnesses, surgeries, and family health history?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead. I don’t mind at all. I've got a little bit of high blood pressure, that’s why I take medication for that. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, that’s it, really. Family… my mother had diabetes, and my father… heart trouble, I think. Nothing major on either side. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I walk every day, try to eat okay. Is this going to be a long process? Because I have to get back to work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: “Pretty healthy” is relative, Ms. Trefren. Diabetes and heart trouble are significant considerations. And it is important to be thorough. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And absolutely no drugs. I promise. I just… I don’t want to take chances, that’s all. This friend of mine, he’s really good about being careful, but… you never know, right? I'm just trying to be responsible. Are there any side effects to this pill? That’s kind of what I’m most worried about.
DOCTOR: Responsible is… commendable, Ms. Trefren. However, preventative medication isn’t always the most sensible course of action. Side effects are a consideration. Common ones include nausea, diarrhea, and headache, typically mild and resolve on their own. More serious, though rare, include kidney problems and decreased bone density. Now, before proceeding further, we need to rule out any existing HIV infection. Have you had an HIV test recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not recently, no. Never have, actually. I… I haven’t really needed to, you know? But if you need to check, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Is it a blood test? I hate needles, honestly. Is it going to hurt a lot? I really don't like getting blood drawn.
DOCTOR: It is a blood test, Ms. Trefren. And yes, there is a brief moment of discomfort. It is necessary to determine your baseline status before starting any preventative medication. It’s irresponsible to begin PrEP without knowing your current HIV status. Now, let’s get this done. I will also order a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel, given your family history and current blood pressure medication. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I appreciate you being thorough, I really do. But I thought this was just… a simple thing. A pill to take, to be safe. I’m not trying to be difficult, but all this… it’s a bit much, isn’t it? I just want to get the pill and be done with it. Is there any way to just… start it? I'm not high-risk, I don't need a whole panel of tests. And I've got to get back to work soon. Do I really need all this?
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, responsible healthcare requires a comprehensive evaluation, not a superficial one. Your perception of “high-risk” is irrelevant. I am obligated to provide the best possible care, and that includes identifying any potential contraindications or underlying health concerns before prescribing medication. I am not comfortable proceeding without these tests. If you are unwilling to cooperate with a proper evaluation, I suggest you seek care elsewhere. I will document your refusal. Now, are you certain you wish to decline these necessary assessments?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Do the tests. All of them. Just… please, hurry. I really need to get back to work. I’m just… frustrated, that’s all. I thought this would be easier. And tell me when it’s done, okay? I don't want to sit around all day waiting. Is there a nurse I can talk to about the side effects while you process the results? I'd rather hear it from someone else, maybe?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the blood work now. The nurse will contact you to explain the side effects. Please allow ample time for the results to be processed. It typically takes 24-48 hours. I have documented your consent and your preference to discuss side effects with the nurse. I will also need a urine sample. The lab is just down the hall. After that, the nurse will escort you for the blood draw. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Urine sample, then blood draw. Got it. Honestly, this is a lot. But… fine. Let's just get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. Even though it’s… a lot. I guess I'll go find the lab. .
