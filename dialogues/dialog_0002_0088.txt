DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's... well, it's this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a bit now and it's starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, can be really bothersome. “A bit now” – could you tell me a little more about when it started, and if anything specific happened around the time it began?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started, I reckon, maybe... three months ago? It was after a wedding, actually. A friend's wedding. There was a lot of music, pretty loud music, you know? Dancing and everything. I was right near the speakers for a while. I didn't think much of it at the time, just figured my ears were a bit tired. But the ringing just… stayed.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago after a wedding with loud music. That's helpful. And you were close to the speakers, so exposure to loud noise is a likely factor. Is the ringing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's not always there. Like, when things are quiet, that's when I really notice it. If there's background noise, like the TV or something, it kind of fades away. But at night, when I'm trying to sleep... that's the worst. It keeps me awake sometimes. It's like a high-pitched whine, mostly. Not a buzzing, more of a… eeeeee sound, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, a high-pitched whine. And it’s worse at night when it's quiet – that's a pretty common pattern. Has it been getting worse over the past three months, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: I think it's... maybe a little worse. Or maybe I'm just noticing it more now that I'm stressed about it, you know? It definitely hasn't gotten better. I used to be able to ignore it sometimes, but now it's harder. It's just... annoying. Really annoying. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it hasn't improved and is potentially getting slightly worse, and it's causing you some stress. That's understandable. Let's do a quick exam of your ears, just to rule out anything obvious like wax buildup. Then we can talk about some possible causes and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. Go ahead with the exam.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to take a look inside your ears now. I'll gently pull on your earlobe a bit to get a better view. This won't hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, everything looks clear inside both ears – no sign of wax buildup, infection, or anything unusual. Your eardrums look normal too. That's good. Now, I'm going to do a quick hearing test, just to see if there's any measurable hearing loss. It's a simple test – I'll play some tones in your ears and you just tell me when you can hear them. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. A hearing test sounds fine. Just tell me what I need to do. I'm a bit worried about hearing loss, to be honest. Is that what this ringing usually means?
DOCTOR: It's good you're voicing your concerns. Ringing in the ears can be a sign of hearing loss, but it doesn’t always mean that’s the case. There are many possible causes, and we'll get a better idea with the test. Don't worry, we're just gathering information right now. Okay, I’m going to put these headphones on you. I’ll start with your right ear. When you hear a tone, just press this button. It doesn’t matter how faint the tone is, just press the button whenever you hear anything. It’s okay if you miss some, just do your best. I’ll be adjusting the volume and frequency of the tones. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm ready. Headphones are on. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'll try my best to press the button whenever I hear something. It's just... sometimes it's hard to tell, you know? Especially with the ringing in the background.
DOCTOR: Alright, we're all done. Thanks for your patience. The results are... interesting. You have a slight dip in your hearing at higher frequencies in both ears, which is consistent with noise exposure. It's a mild loss, but it's definitely there. This likely explains the tinnitus, or ringing, you’ve been experiencing. It’s common after exposure to loud sounds. So, what does this mean?
PATIENT: Okay... so it is from the wedding then? That makes sense, I guess. A slight dip in hearing... is that serious? Will it get worse? And what can I do about the ringing? Is there anything? I really don't want this to be permanent.
DOCTOR: It’s very likely the wedding was a contributing factor, yes. Loud noise is a common cause of this type of hearing loss. A mild dip in hearing isn't usually serious in itself, but it's important to prevent further damage. The good news is, it doesn't automatically mean it will get worse. The key is protecting your ears from further noise exposure. This pamphlet has some helpful tips on that. There are also things we can try to manage the ringing itself. Tinnitus management often involves a combination of strategies. One is sound therapy – using background noise to mask the ringing. Another is cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, which can help you learn to cope with the annoyance. We can also explore some relaxation techniques to reduce stress, as stress can worsen tinnitus. We're not going to jump into anything drastic right away. I recommend starting with protecting your ears and seeing if the ringing improves on its own. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you’re doing and discuss other options if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. Protecting my ears, I can definitely do that. I'll get some earplugs, for sure. And the sound therapy… masking the ringing… I guess that makes sense. I'm not really sure about the CBT, to be honest. But I'm willing to try anything at this point. A follow-up appointment in a month sounds good, yeah. Just to see how it's going. Thanks, Doctor. That's… a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Remember, we’re here to help you manage this. I'll write up a summary of our discussion and instructions for ear protection, and we'll schedule that follow-up appointment for a month from today. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and I'll see you in a month.
