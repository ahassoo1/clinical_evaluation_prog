DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s... it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I've been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids… that certainly warrants a look. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started, I think, in my legs. Just feeling a little more tired after walking, you know? Now it’s… it’s harder to get up from a chair. And it’s spreading, I think. My arms feel it too, sometimes. It's not constant, it comes and goes. It's just… frustrating. I used to be quite active, and now... not so much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it began in your legs, progressed over months, and is now affecting your arms as well. And it’s intermittent – comes and goes. That’s helpful to know. When you say "tired," can you describe that feeling a little more specifically?
PATIENT: It's not like muscle soreness, not exactly. It's more… like there’s just less power there. Like it takes a lot more effort to do things, even simple things. Imagine trying to lift something heavier than it is, even though it’s not that heavy. And it’s not painful, thankfully. It’s just… exhausting. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Gedalya. You're describing a loss of strength, or fatigue that isn’t related to muscle pain. That’s very important information. And don't worry about explaining; it’s my job to help you put it all together. Now, about those eyelids… you mentioned they’re drooping. Is it both eyelids, or just one?
PATIENT: It's both, Doctor, but I think my right eyelid is worse. It's… noticeable, I suppose. People have started asking if I'm alright, if I'm getting enough sleep. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. It started subtly, and now it’s… well, more obvious. It doesn't hurt, but it feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyelids, right worse than left, and feeling heavy. I see. Have you noticed any blurring of your vision, or double vision at all?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I wear glasses, so it's difficult to say. My vision hasn't been worse than usual, if that makes sense. It's been about the same, but I can't really tell if it's the glasses needing adjusting, or… something else. I had my eyes checked about six months ago, and they said everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Alright, vision stable, glasses prescription current as of six months ago. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any difficulty with swallowing, or changes in your voice at all?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. Swallowing is normal, and my voice… well, it feels the same. My ex-wife would probably disagree about that last part, but that's a separate issue entirely. No changes in voice, no difficulty swallowing. Just the weakness and the eyelids.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll focus on the weakness and the eyelids for now. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no weight loss… and definitely no night sweats. I've actually been eating more lately, probably because I'm tired more easily and feel like I need the energy. I haven't been sick at all, really. It's just… this gradual weakness. It's been unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight loss, increased appetite. Good. Have you noticed any changes in your skin – any rashes, or unusual bruising?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My skin feels normal, I suppose. I burn easily, being Swedish and all, but that's just normal for me in the sun. No rashes, no bruising. I'm fairly careful, don't do anything too adventurous these days. Just… normal Swedish skin, I guess. It's pale. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Pale skin doesn't necessarily indicate anything, Gedalya. Just noting it. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a teenager, playing football, but it healed fine. Nothing chronic, nothing serious. My family history… my mother had some issues with her blood pressure, but that's about it. Otherwise, we're a fairly healthy bunch.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, childhood illnesses only, broken arm in the past, family history of hypertension. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries at all. I avoid hospitals when possible, if that’s alright. A bit of a phobia, I suppose. I’m perfectly healthy, usually. It’s just… this weakness. I’m starting to worry it’s something serious. It’s been building for months now, and it's not getting better.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to hospitals, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. We’ll take things one step at a time. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but that's it. And I haven’t taken any supplements in years. I try to eat a healthy diet, but I’m not overly strict about it. Just… normal Swedish food, I suppose. Lots of fish, potatoes. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, occasional ibuprofen use only. And no allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I can eat anything, breathe anything. Unless you count dust, but I think everyone's a little allergic to dust. No, no known allergies. Just… this weakness. And the eyelids. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but it's just… worrying.
DOCTOR: You’re not repeating yourself, Gedalya, and it's good you're sharing all of this with me. It helps me get a complete picture. Okay, let's see… I’m just reviewing your record here… no prior visits noted. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your vital signs, look at your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. Then, I think some blood work would be a good next step to help us figure out what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam and blood work… yes, please. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. The sooner we know what it is, the better. I just... I’m starting to feel quite anxious about it, to be honest. But yes, let’s do the exam and the blood work. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. If you could have a seat here for me, that would be great. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we’ll move onto the neurological exam. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric in all extremities. Cranial nerves are intact. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups, but I do note some mild fatigability with sustained grip strength. Now, let’s just check your gait… could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. It feels a little… unsteady, Doctor. I don’t usually walk like that. But I suppose I’ve been sitting down a lot lately. It’s hard to say, really. It’s just… tiring.
DOCTOR: I noticed that as well, Gedalya. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and there’s some mild weakness noted in the lower extremities, as you mentioned. Based on this initial exam, along with your reported symptoms of weakness and drooping eyelids, I’d like to order some blood work. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin D level, and creatine kinase level. We’ll also check for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, to rule out myasthenia gravis, as the drooping eyelids and weakness could be indicative of that. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Myasthenia gravis… I’ve heard of that, vaguely. If that’s what it is, I trust you can treat it? I appreciate you being so… comprehensive. The blood work sounds good. Whatever it takes, really. I just want to know what’s wrong, and what we can do about it. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, myasthenia gravis is a treatable condition, and we have several options available. It’s important to rule it out, though, as early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve outcomes. The lab work should be back within 3 to 5 business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty breathing, double vision, or increased weakness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Three to five business days… and go to the emergency room if things worsen. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor Beinborn. I… I feel a little better, just knowing we’re doing something about it. I appreciate your time, and your thoroughness. I’ll wait for the results, and schedule a follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I understand your anxiety, and I'm glad I could alleviate some of it. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day.
