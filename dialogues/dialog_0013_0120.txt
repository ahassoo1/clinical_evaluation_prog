DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want it to be easy, you know? No problems. My husband… well, he passed, and I'm not getting any younger. I want this done quickly and without a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're wanting to explore options for getting pregnant, and you're hoping for a smooth process, especially given your circumstances. I'm very sorry for your loss, Carmaleta. It's completely understandable you want to be efficient with this. "Easy" is relative, of course, but we can definitely work to make this as straightforward as possible. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly… it's a blur. I saw doctors when I had to, you know? Routine stuff. I don't really remember specifics. I was healthy enough, I suppose. My husband always took care of all that paperwork anyway. I had the usual vaccinations, I think. Nothing major, never been seriously sick. Is that good enough? I really don’t have time to dredge up appointments from years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can work with that. It's common to not remember every detail, especially if it was a while ago. Since you don't have a lot of specifics, let’s start with what is readily available. I'll pull up your record here... ...Okay, it looks like you’ve had a few visits here for preventative care, last one was about three years ago. No major concerns noted then. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies... Hmm. I don't think so. I eat everything, pretty much. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes with spicy food, but that's not an allergy, is it? I've never had a serious reaction to anything. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies these days. My mother always said a little discomfort builds character. Is this important? I feel like you're asking a lot of… basic questions.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to be thorough, Carmaleta, even if it seems basic. Heartburn isn’t an allergy, no. We just want to rule out anything that could interfere with a potential pregnancy or medication we might use. Okay, good. No known allergies. What about any medications you're currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… everything?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… I take a multivitamin, sometimes. The one with extra iron, because I heard it's good for… well, you know. And occasionally, when my joints act up, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind, nothing fancy. Other than that… no. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I prefer natural remedies, if that makes any difference. Do I have to list everything I've ever taken? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin with iron and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. It is helpful to know everything, even occasional use, because even over-the-counter medications can have interactions. Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your cycle. When was your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: My… cycle? Really? Look, I’m not going to get into the details of… that. That’s a bit personal, isn’t it? I mean, I know how it works, generally. It happens. It’s been… regular enough. More or less. Why does that matter anyway? Is this going to take all day? I need to get this done, and frankly, talking about this is just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Carmaleta, and I apologize if I'm pushing too far. Knowing your last period is important because it helps us determine where you are in your cycle, which is crucial for timing things correctly. If you're not comfortable giving me an exact date, can you give me a rough estimate – like, within the last month, two months, or longer?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It was… maybe three weeks ago? Give or take. I don’t keep a calendar or anything. Honestly, I just noticed it stopped, and that’s why I'm here. I don’t want to waste any time. Is that enough information? Can we move on? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, approximately. That's helpful. Alright. Before we discuss options, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It'll be pretty straightforward – just checking your blood pressure, weight, and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever gets this over with faster. Just… be quick about it. I don't like doctors poking around. And please, don't tell me about every little thing you're doing. I don't need a lecture. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Just relax, and I'll be as efficient as possible. First, could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Ugh, this table is cold. There. Happy? Now can we please get on with it? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, 130 pounds. And your height is 164 centimeters, confirming what's in your record. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is good. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to do a quick abdominal exam, just to check everything feels normal. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You’re poking my stomach now? It feels… fine. Honestly, I don't understand why you need to do all this. I'm a perfectly healthy woman. Just get it over with. I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything feels normal. Alright. So, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, there are no immediate red flags. Given your age and the fact that you've had regular cycles in the past, we can likely proceed with some basic fertility testing and discuss options for trying to conceive. To start, I recommend a blood test to check your hormone levels – things like FSH, LH, and estradiol – to see how your ovaries are functioning. We can also do a pregnancy test, just to confirm, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Fine, whatever. Just… can I get the results quickly? I don't want to wait weeks for this. And can someone explain them to me in plain English? I don't want a lot of medical jargon. Just tell me if everything is okay, or not. Honestly, I just want a baby, not a science lesson. And if it's going to be expensive, you need to tell me now. My insurance… covers most things, I think. But I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I understand. We can get those blood tests done today. The lab should have the results within 48-72 hours, and I promise I'll explain them to you in plain English – no jargon. We'll focus on what the results mean for you and your ability to conceive. And you're right to ask about costs. Let me check your insurance coverage here… …Okay, it looks like your insurance does cover most of the basic fertility testing, with a co-pay of $150. If we need to do any more advanced testing – like an ultrasound or a semen analysis – we can discuss those costs beforehand. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now. Is there anything else you want to ask me before we proceed?
PATIENT: $150... Fine. Just get it over with. I don't want any more bills showing up. No, that's all. Just do the tests, tell me the results, and let's get this done. I really don't have time for this, you know? My life is… busy. Just… hurry. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’ll have the lab technician come in to draw your blood now. They’re very efficient. After the blood draw, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – like heavy bleeding or severe pain – please don't hesitate to call the clinic.
