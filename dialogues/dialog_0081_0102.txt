DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor...Paulino, right? Yes, well, it's...it's a bit hard to explain. I just...find myself sighing a lot lately. Deep breaths, you know? Not painful, exactly, just...a lot of it. Happens all throughout the day, I think. I don't really keep track of time these days, to be honest. My wife...she always did that.
DOCTOR: Sighing... throughout the day. And you said this is new?
PATIENT: New...hmm. That’s a good question. It feels new, yes. Or maybe it's just...more noticeable now. I used to have so much on my plate with the police work, always running around. Didn't have time to notice things, you see? Now...well, now things are quiet. Very quiet. It’s probably been…a few months, maybe? I really can't say for sure. Sorry, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Quiet, you say. And aside from the sighing, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes... Well, I get tired easier, I think. Not like I’m sick, just…more weary. And sometimes…sometimes I feel a little…empty, you know? Like something’s missing. But that could just be…everything. It's been a long time since…since my wife passed. She did everything around the house. I don't even know where to start. Is that what you mean by changes, Doctor? I apologize if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and a general sense of emptiness…right. And this fatigue, does it interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfere... Yes, a little. I used to walk to the market every morning, get fresh vegetables. Now…now I mostly stay inside. It's not that I can't walk, it's just…I don’t want to, if that makes sense. It feels…effortful. And I used to enjoy tending to my garden, but…haven't done that in weeks, maybe months. I don’t even remember the last time I properly watered the plants. Is that…bad? I don’t know what’s normal anymore. Everything feels…off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Pal…palpitations? Swelling? Oh dear. No, no, nothing like that. My chest feels…fine, I think. Maybe a little tight sometimes, but that’s probably just…old age. And my legs…no swelling. I wear sandals mostly, so I’d notice, wouldn’t I? I'm not very good with…medical terms, Doctor. Could you explain those to me, please? What exactly is palpitations? I want to be helpful, but I’m a bit lost.
DOCTOR: Palpitations are when your heart races or feels like it's skipping a beat. It's a sensation, an awareness of your heartbeat. And swelling in the legs, or edema, would be noticeable puffiness. But never mind. Let’s focus on the sighing and the fatigue. Any recent changes in your diet or medications?
PATIENT: No changes in diet, no. I mostly eat rice and fish. Simple things. And…medications… That's a tricky one. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill, but…I think I ran out a while ago. My wife always managed the pills. I haven't really kept up with it since she…since she passed. I’m not even sure what it was for, to be honest. Just that the doctor told me to take it. I feel terrible, I shouldn't be so careless.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you've been sighing for a few months. Is it associated with any particular activity?
PATIENT: Associated…hmm. No, not really. It just…happens. Sometimes when I'm sitting and thinking, sometimes when I'm trying to sleep, sometimes just…randomly. It's not like it comes after doing something, it's just…there. Although… I do notice it more when I'm alone. When I'm quiet, you see? When I’m just…remembering things. It's probably just sadness, you know? Old age and…and missing my wife. But it feels…more than that, sometimes. It feels like…a weight in my chest, and the sighing is just letting it out. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Just relax.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. My heart…is it bad? I haven't been feeling very well lately. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if something is wrong. My wife always said I worry too much. I'll try to relax, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds…slightly diminished, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is elevated. Your blood pressure is a bit high, and your heart sounds are a little faint. These findings could be due to a number of things. I want to run some blood work to get a better picture of what’s going on. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We should also get an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity. And it's important that you get back on a blood pressure medication. I'll write you a prescription for Lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily.
PATIENT: Blood work…EKG…Lisinopril… Oh dear. That sounds…like a lot. My wife always handled all of this. I'm not very good with remembering things, Doctor. Will I need to fast for the blood work? And what exactly is a thyroid…thingy? Is it serious? And Lisinopril…what does it do? I don't want to forget to take it, but I'm worried I will. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. The blood work requires a 12-hour fast – no food or drinks except water. The thyroid stimulating hormone test checks your thyroid function; it’s a small gland in your neck that regulates metabolism. It’s relatively common to have thyroid issues, and often easily managed. Lisinopril is a blood pressure medication; it helps lower your blood pressure and reduces strain on your heart. Here are detailed instructions for the blood work and medication. It also has my clinic number if you have any questions. It’s crucially important you follow these instructions and take the Lisinopril as prescribed. I understand this is a lot, but ignoring these issues will only lead to further complications. We’ll review the results in a week. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist before you leave.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand…I think. A 12-hour fast…thyroid…Lisinopril… It’s just…so much. My wife…she always knew what to do. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try my best. But…please, don’t be angry if I forget something. Or if I need to call you…a lot. I think I need to sit down. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up. And please, make an effort to remember. You can sit in the waiting room if you feel unwell. .
