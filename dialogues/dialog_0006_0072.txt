DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Doctor Gorga. It's... it's a bit embarrassing, really. I've been having trouble remembering things lately. It’s not like, big important things all the time, but… little things. And it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Okay. Trouble remembering… little things, you say. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… maybe six months? It's hard to say exactly. It started gradually, you know? I'd forget where I put my keys, or what I went into a room to get. Little stuff like that. Now it feels like it’s happening more and more often. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Six months… gradually worsening. Okay. And can you give me an example of something that happened recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just yesterday, I made a grocery list, very carefully. Went to the store, had the list in my hand… and when I got to the checkout, I couldn't remember what I was supposed to be buying. I just stood there like an idiot! The cashier was nice about it, but… it was awful. I ended up just grabbing a few things I thought I needed and left. I felt so silly.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And besides the groceries… have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… not really, I don't think. I mean, I've been a little more… clumsy, maybe? I tripped over the rug the other day, which I never do. But that could just be me being tired, I guess. I haven’t noticed anything else major. Honestly, that’s why I was putting off coming in. I didn’t want to bother you with something that might just be stress.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Stress is a big factor, certainly. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing serious. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I do have high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. And I had a really bad flu last winter, but I recovered fully. I don’t think anything related to… this.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication… good. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never had any reason to have any. I try to stay active, eat reasonably well... you know, the usual. It’s just… this memory thing is really unsettling. I’m a dentist, Doctor, I need to remember things!
DOCTOR: A dentist, yes, I can appreciate that. Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had dementia, I think. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember a lot of details, but my mom always said she started forgetting things when she was in her seventies. And my uncle, her brother, he had Alzheimer's. But… that was much later in life, too. I don’t know if that’s relevant, since I'm only 38.
DOCTOR: Dementia in grandmother, Alzheimer's in uncle… noted. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Just the blood pressure pills, Lisinopril. And I take a multivitamin, but that’s it. Nothing else. No supplements, no over-the-counter stuff, nothing. I really try to avoid taking anything if I don’t absolutely need it. Do you think it could be the blood pressure medication?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, but not particularly common. We'll keep it in mind. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat whatever, take most medications without issue... it’s one of the few things I don’t have to worry about. Is this helping? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're doing fine. This is helpful. It helps me get a picture of what’s going on. Okay, last few quick questions. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never have, never will. I don't even like being around smokers, to be honest. And… I drink occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple on the weekends. But nothing excessive. I’m pretty active, like I said. I like hiking and biking when I have the time. Does that sound… okay?
DOCTOR: Perfectly okay. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Nothing too involved, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you need me to do, just let me know. I’m a little nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam, just some simple tests to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Please relax, and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. I'll try.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but within a reasonable range given your history. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Good. Reflexes are symmetrical and within normal limits. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m following it. Is that alright? I'm trying to keep my eyes on it, but it's a little hard to judge distance… Should I be wearing my glasses? I have them in my purse.
DOCTOR: Yes, please put on your glasses. That would be very helpful. We need to make sure we get an accurate assessment.
PATIENT: There we go. Much better. Are we still checking my eyes?
DOCTOR: Yes. Follow my finger, please. Good. Seems normal. Now, let's check your balance. Stand up slowly, please, and try to stand with your feet together and your eyes closed.
PATIENT: Okay… I'm trying to stay still. It’s a little wobbly, but I think I’m alright. Is this okay? I feel a bit silly standing here with my eyes closed… I think I need to hold onto something.
DOCTOR: Easy now, easy. Yes, it's okay to hold on. That's perfectly alright. A little bit of unsteadiness is not necessarily concerning. Alright. That's enough for the quick exam. Let me review my notes. So, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some early memory issues, likely of a gradual onset. The unsteadiness could be related, or it could be a separate issue. There are a number of possibilities… stress, vitamin deficiencies, even medication side effects. The family history is something we need to consider. We'll need to run some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to get a better look.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot. MRI… is that… serious? I mean, I know you have to be careful, but… Blood tests are fine, I guess, but the MRI sounds scary. What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: It’s a precaution, Ms. Heidenthal. An MRI is a very good imaging tool, and it will help us rule out things like strokes, tumors, or any structural problems in the brain. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. It's simply to get a clearer picture. We’ll be looking for any changes in brain volume, or areas of inflammation. The blood tests will check for vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid problems, and other common causes of memory loss. We'll also test for early markers of inflammation. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 levels. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They can perform more detailed cognitive testing and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a plan, I guess. A neurologist… alright. It’s just… a lot to take in. So, blood tests and an MRI, then see a specialist. When would I schedule the MRI? And the neurologist? Do you have any recommendations? I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. I'm going to have the lab draw the blood tests today, before you leave. The results usually take a few days. As for the MRI, I'll have my nurse schedule it for you. She’ll find a facility that’s convenient and covered by your insurance. It's best to get it done as soon as possible. As for the neurologist, I recommend Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent, very thorough, and takes the time to explain everything to her patients. I’ll give you her contact information and a referral slip. Here's the referral for Dr. Sharma, the lab request form, and a list of instructions for the MRI. The MRI instructions are important - it tells you what to expect and how to prepare. I'll also have my nurse call you tomorrow to schedule the MRI and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We're taking all the necessary steps to figure out what's going on. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, actually. That's a lot of information, but I feel… a little better knowing we're getting it checked out. Thank you, Doctor. It really means a lot. I’ll call if I think of anything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
