DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, I keep... belching. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not all the time, but… a lot. It’s kind of embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite disruptive, and you are right to address it. “A little while now” is a bit vague – could you tell me approximately how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… two, three months? Something like that. It started slow, just after… after a lot of parties, I think. Now it happens even when I haven't been to a party. It's just… pops… there it is again! Sorry.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all. It's important to understand the full picture, and those details are helpful. So, it began around the time of several social gatherings, and has persisted even with a quieter lifestyle. Could you describe the belching itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s just… air. You know? Like a bubble coming up. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like much, just a little pop. But sometimes… sometimes it’s… loud. And it smells… not good. Not all the time, but sometimes. It makes me feel… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the belching varies in intensity and occasionally is accompanied by an unpleasant odor. That is good information. Has anything specific – certain foods, drinks, or activities – seemed to trigger these episodes, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I drink a lot of soda, I think. Maybe that? And… I like fried food. A lot. It feels… better after, but maybe it makes the belching worse later? I don’t really… pay attention, I guess. Sometimes it happens after I eat fast, too. I don't eat slow, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Fogelstrom. Soda and fried foods, and eating quickly—those are all potential contributors. And it’s good you’ve recognized a connection, even if it’s not a perfect awareness. Aside from the belching, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… sometimes my stomach feels a little… full. Even when I haven’t eaten much. And… sometimes I feel a little bit of heartburn, but not a lot. It’s just a little burning feeling in my chest, sometimes after I eat. But not every time. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely matters. Fullness even after eating a small amount, and occasional heartburn—those are both important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions to get a broader picture. Have you had any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I think I stay the same weight. Maybe a little up, maybe a little down, but nothing big. I try to eat okay. Not perfect, but… okay. I like my food. It’s hard to eat less of it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be difficult to make changes to one’s diet. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions—things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else a doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven't really been to the doctor much. Just for… check-ups, when I have to. Nobody ever told me I had anything. I don't have insurance, so I don’t go unless I really need to. So, mostly I just… try to feel okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's important information to know. And thank you for sharing that. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t had any surgeries. I’m… healthy, usually. Just this… belching thing. It’s embarrassing, and it’s been going on for a while, so I thought I should come see someone. It’s just… annoying, you know? And sometimes it smells bad, and… well. It’s just a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating, and you’re right to seek it out. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Hmm… my mother, she has… I don’t know what it’s called… stomach problems sometimes. She gets… sick, and feels full a lot. And my father… he had heartburn, a lot. He always took something for it. But that’s all I really know. They live in Cuba, so it’s hard to talk about it. It's a long way away.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. Bad for you, you know? I drink a little bit of… rum sometimes. But not a lot. Just at parties. And with friends. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, usually. Except maybe… sometimes I get a little bit of a stomach ache after really spicy food. But that’s not an allergy, right? Just… spicy.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound like an allergy. Okay. Now, Ms. Fogelstrom, based on what you’ve told me—the belching, the occasional heartburn, the fullness, the association with certain foods and eating habits, and your family history—it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms related to mild gastroesophageal reflux, or GERD, and possibly some functional dyspepsia. However, to rule out anything more serious, and to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… GERD? What is that? Is that bad? And a physical exam… what will you do? I’m a little bit nervous, I think. I don’t like doctors very much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. GERD stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Essentially, it means that stomach acid is sometimes flowing back up into your esophagus – the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. It can cause heartburn, belching, and the other symptoms you’ve been experiencing. It's often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. As for the physical exam, it will be very simple. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It won't be uncomfortable, and it will only take a few minutes. I’ll explain everything as I go along, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain anything further before we begin?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… not so bad, maybe. But… what if you find something wrong? I don't have insurance, you know? What if it’s expensive to fix? That’s what I’m really worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Fogelstrom, and I completely understand your worry. My priority is to figure out what’s going on and to help you feel better. If, during the exam, I find something concerning, I will explain it to you thoroughly, including all your options. Before we proceed with any further tests or treatment, we can discuss the costs involved and explore options that fit your budget. There are often lower-cost alternatives available, and I can also connect you with resources that may be able to help with financial assistance. We will take things one step at a time, and I won’t recommend anything without a full discussion of the pros, cons, and costs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. That sounds… better. Taking it one step at a time. And talking about the costs… that’s good. Okay. Let’s do the exam. But… please be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very gentle, and I will explain everything as I go along. I promise. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. This will help me check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: No… not really. A little bit… here. But it’s not… bad pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like… full. Even though I haven’t eaten much today.
DOCTOR: Okay. I feel a little bit of fullness there as well. It’s not concerningly tender, but it does seem to be a sensitive area. Your abdomen is otherwise soft and there are no masses that I can feel. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, my suspicion remains mild GERD, possibly with some functional dyspepsia, meaning your stomach is a bit sensitive. However, to get a clearer picture, I would recommend a few simple tests. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? Are they… expensive? And will they hurt? I really don't want anything painful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fogelstrom. The tests I have in mind are quite simple and generally not painful. I'd like to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues, and a stool test to check for any inflammation or infection. And finally, I would like to do an upper endoscopy to get a look at your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. The stool test and blood work are relatively inexpensive. The endoscopy is more expensive, but it's the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms. We can discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs before proceeding. I will explain each test in detail, and you can ask me any questions you have. If you're not comfortable with any of the tests, we can explore alternative options. Would you like me to start by explaining the blood work in more detail?
