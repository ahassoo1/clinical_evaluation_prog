DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor Chagaris. It’s lovely to meet you too. Oh, it’s these hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, a good few days now, and they just won’t stop. It’s a bit silly, coming to a doctor for hiccups, but they're quite persistent, you see.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mirriam. Persistent hiccups can be quite bothersome, and it's good you came in to have them checked. A few days is certainly long enough to warrant a look. To start, could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started after I had a particularly fizzy drink with my friend, Elsie, on Saturday. Just a little celebration, nothing big. But ever since then… hic …they just keep coming. Not constantly, mind you, but several times an hour, easy. It's more annoying than painful, honestly. I try to hold my breath, you know, like people say, but it doesn’t seem to do much good. hic It’s just…irritating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like they began somewhat suddenly after the fizzy drink, and holding your breath hasn’t provided much relief. That’s helpful to know. And are there any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. No, not really. I haven't felt sick, no fever or anything like that. And no pain, like I said. Just… the hiccups. hic I’ve been eating normally, sleeping alright. Elsie asked if I’d been feeling stressed, but no more than usual, I suppose. Old age has its worries, doesn’t it? chuckles softly But nothing out of the ordinary to trigger something like this, not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mirriam. And no, nothing out of the ordinary is a good sign. It’s good to hear you’re eating and sleeping well, and haven’t been experiencing any fever or pain. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history. That's a bit of a list, Doctor. I was a psychiatric aide for many years, you see, so I’ve seen a fair bit of it myself! Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be twenty years now. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a while back, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for ages. Other than that, not much, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with being eighty-six! chuckles I've been generally healthy, all things considered. I see my regular doctor, Dr. Patel, for checkups, and she's always been happy with how I'm doing. I’m not sure what she’d make of these hiccups though!
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mirriam. Gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and well-controlled blood pressure – good to know. And it's reassuring to hear you generally feel healthy and have regular checkups with Dr. Patel. I may reach out to her for more information if needed. Do you recall what medication you’re currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh yes, of course. It's Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day, every morning with my breakfast. I've been on it for… oh, goodness, must be eight or nine years now. It keeps things nice and steady. Dr. Patel checks it every time I see her, and she’s always pleased with the numbers. I don’t usually have any trouble with it, no side effects or anything like that. hic Just… these pesky hiccups! I’m starting to feel a bit silly even talking about them so much.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Mirriam. It’s important to investigate anything that’s bothering you, and hiccups that persist for this long certainly warrant attention. Lisinopril ten milligrams daily – thank you for that information. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications, or to anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. And no food allergies either. I eat most things, although I'm not terribly fond of oysters, but that's a matter of taste, not allergy! chuckles Elsie always tries to get me to eat them when we go out, says they're an acquired taste. But I think I’m quite happy not acquiring it, thank you very much. hic No, no allergies. I’m a pretty straightforward case, Doctor. Just these hiccups!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mirriam. No known allergies simplifies things. And while they may seem trivial, we’ll certainly get to the bottom of these hiccups. To get a more complete picture, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history... Well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, so there's good longevity on that side of the family. She had a bit of trouble with arthritis in her later years, but otherwise, she was quite healthy. My father passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. And I have one brother, he’s a few years younger than me, living in Australia now. He’s perfectly healthy as far as I know, keeps himself very active, always going on about his gardening. No major illnesses on either side, not that I recall. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. hic I'm not sure how much help that is, really.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mirriam. Good longevity on your mother’s side, and your brother being active is a positive sign. Knowing there’s no significant family history of major illnesses is reassuring. Now, to get a better understanding of your current lifestyle, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history? Well, as I mentioned, I was a psychiatric aide for many years. It was very rewarding work, although quite demanding. I retired about twenty years ago. I’m divorced, been on my own for a long time now. I have a good friend, Elsie, we see each other often, go to the movies, have lunch, that sort of thing. I enjoy reading, and I do a bit of gardening myself, although nothing like my brother! I live in a lovely little bungalow, very comfortable. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to keep myself active, you know, going for walks, doing a bit of housework. I’m a fairly quiet person, really, but I enjoy my life. hic It's just these hiccups interrupting it all!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Mirriam. It's wonderful that you have a good friend like Elsie, and that you enjoy reading and gardening. And it's good to hear you stay active and don't smoke. Alright, Mirriam, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and perhaps take your blood pressure again. It will help me rule out any underlying causes for these hiccups. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. You go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, after all! chuckles softly I'm happy to do whatever you need to figure out what's causing these pesky hiccups. hic Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back and relax. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Blood pressure is 138/78, which is a little elevated, but within an acceptable range. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, Mirriam. Your vital signs are stable, and there's no obvious cause for the hiccups that I can detect physically.
PATIENT: Oh, that's... good to hear, I suppose. hic So, what does that mean, Doctor? Are you saying it's just… one of those things? I’m a bit worried, you know. I've never had hiccups go on for this long before. Is there something you can give me to stop them? hic A pill, perhaps? I really just want them to go away!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mirriam. It’s frustrating when something persists without a clear explanation. The fact that the physical exam is normal is reassuring, but it doesn’t rule everything out. Hiccups can sometimes be caused by things that aren't easily detectable on a physical exam, such as irritation of the diaphragm, or even certain medications, although Lisinopril is not commonly associated with persistent hiccups. There are a few things we can try. Often, hiccups resolve on their own. We could try some simple maneuvers, like holding your breath for a longer period, or drinking a glass of water quickly. There are also some medications that can sometimes help, but they’re not always effective, and they can have side effects. Before we consider medication, I’d like to order a few blood tests, just to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… well, I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Yes, alright, Doctor, go ahead and order the tests. hic I just really want to get rid of these things. They’re starting to make me quite tired, you know? Constantly interrupting my sleep and all. And Elsie keeps offering me all sorts of silly remedies – vinegar, sugar, holding my nose… it’s all a bit ridiculous! chuckles weakly I'm trusting you to figure this out, Doctor. hic
DOCTOR: I understand, Mirriam. It’s good you’re trusting me, and I’ll do my best to get to the bottom of this. And Elsie’s remedies sound… creative! Alright, I'll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a magnesium level. These will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any potential imbalances. The lab technician will collect a small blood sample – it’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. In the meantime, I’ll also write you a prescription for Baclofen, a muscle relaxant, to help calm the diaphragm. It’s a low dose, and we can adjust it if needed. It’s not a guaranteed fix, but it may provide some relief. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, Baclofen, is that a strong pill? I don't want to be all drowsy and out of it! hic And the blood tests… will I have to fast beforehand? I had a lovely breakfast this morning, you know. And will they tell me the results right away? hic I'm a bit worried about all these tests, to be honest. Old age makes you a bit anxious about these things, I suppose. chuckles softly Maybe Elsie was right about the vinegar… No, no, I shouldn’t listen to her silly remedies. hic
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mirriam. It’s good you're asking questions, and I’ll do my best to address your concerns. Baclofen is a relatively mild muscle relaxant, and we’re starting with a very low dose. The goal is to calm the diaphragm without causing excessive drowsiness. However, it’s true that drowsiness is a potential side effect. If you experience any significant drowsiness, or any other bothersome side effects, please let me know immediately, and we can adjust the dose or discontinue the medication. Regarding the blood tests, you do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except water. I apologize for the inconvenience, especially since you had a lovely breakfast. The lab will draw the blood first thing tomorrow morning. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I'll review them carefully and contact you to discuss them and formulate a plan. We’ll take things one step at a time, Mirriam. Let’s start with the blood tests and see what they reveal. In the meantime, continue to hold your breath, drink water, and try to relax. And if the hiccups become severe or unbearable, please don’t hesitate to contact me, or go to the nearest emergency room.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, you've explained everything very clearly. Fasting it is, then. hic And I'll try to relax, although these hiccups don't make it easy! chuckles weakly I suppose I should thank Elsie for the distraction, then, even if her remedies are a bit silly. hic Thank you for being so patient with an old woman worrying about hiccups. I feel a bit better knowing you're taking this seriously. And I'll be sure to call you if they get any worse. hic I think that's all my questions for now. I suppose I should get home and prepare for my fast. chuckles softly It's going to be a long night! hic
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It's my pleasure, and I'm glad I could reassure you. And you're not silly at all for worrying – it's important to address anything that’s bothering you. Yes, it may be a long night, but you’ve got this. Remember, if you have any concerns at all, please don't hesitate to contact me. Here’s the lab requisition form, and the prescription for Baclofen. I’ll see you tomorrow after you've had the blood tests. In the meantime, get some rest and try to relax. Have a good evening, Mirriam. And don’t worry too much about the hiccups! hic We'll figure it out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. You have a good evening too. And I'll try my best to worry less. chuckles softly It’s easier said than done, though! hic
