DOCTOR: Right, yes. Carmaleta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so if we could just get straight to it, that would be great. I just… want to make sure everything’s okay, you know? Before it gets… too late.
DOCTOR: "Too late" is… dramatic, don't you think?
PATIENT: Well, I’m not getting any younger, am I? And it's not like I have… options. My husband… well, never mind. Just tell me what tests I need. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just… skim through your record here. You’re 43, Ghanaian… height and weight seem… proportionate. Any significant complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? No, not really. I feel fine. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure nothing's wrong with me. That’s why I'm here. Honestly, I don't understand why I even need to explain this. Is something usually wrong with people my age? It’s just… a precaution.
DOCTOR: Precaution?
PATIENT: Look, I don't need a lecture, okay? My friend, Beatrice, she had a perfectly healthy baby at 45. Perfectly healthy. But she went to a good doctor, and they did everything. I want everything. I don’t want to waste time, and I certainly don’t want a surprise later. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Beatrice, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Beatrice. She's very careful, very particular. She wouldn't just trust anyone, you know? She always says prevention is better than… well, you get the idea. She goes to Dr. Anya Sharma, over in the city. She understands. But I thought I'd try you first, since you’re… closer. But if this is going to be a whole interrogation about my age, maybe I should just call Beatrice.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s just start with a basic blood panel. Routine stuff. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function. And a urine sample. We'll see what comes back. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy. I eat well, I try to get enough sleep… well, as much as one can these days. Are those tests going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: The bloodwork will be sent to the lab. You’ll have to sit for about ten minutes while the phlebotomist draws it. The urine sample, you can do that right now in the bathroom. It's a standard procedure. It will all take maybe… half an hour, forty minutes tops. Let’s just get it over with.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… tell me where the bathroom is. And make it quick, alright? This is really disrupting my schedule. I had a hair appointment after this. Honestly, the things one has to do...
DOCTOR: Down the hall, second door on the left. There's a small waiting area outside. I'll have the nurse come get you when we’re ready. And please, try to relax. It's just a few tests. Don’t complicate things.
PATIENT: Complicate things? I’m not complicating things! Honestly… some doctors these days. Just a few tests… it’s always “just a few tests”. I swear... .
DOCTOR: Honestly. Some patients. Stop.
