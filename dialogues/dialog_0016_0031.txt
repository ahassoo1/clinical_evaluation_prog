DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Well, my left leg... it's gotten quite swollen. And, um, the nurse mentioned something about my heart... a fluttering, she said? I've been told it's called atrial fibrillation before, but I don't rightly understand it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, swelling in your left leg and some fluttering sensations – that's good information to start with. And it's alright if you don't understand the medical terms; that's what I'm here for! Let’s break things down. First, regarding the leg swelling, can you tell me when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, barely noticeable. I thought it was just from being on my feet too long, teaching the students. But it's gotten worse each day. It’s quite uncomfortable now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, gradually worsening, and related to being on your feet… that’s helpful. And you said you’re a teacher?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I teach computer science at the postsecondary school. It’s a good job, keeps me busy. Though, all the standing... and now this swelling. It’s making it harder to get around.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Standing a lot can definitely contribute to swelling, but we want to rule out other possibilities. Is the swelling just in your left leg, or is it also in your right leg or anywhere else, like your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Just the left leg, Doctor. My right leg feels perfectly normal. And my feet and ankles seem fine. It's just... this one leg. It feels heavy and tight, mostly around the calf, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left leg, mostly around the calf. And you mentioned a heavy, tight sensation. Do you have any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. More like… a dull ache, if anything. It’s not sharp or sudden, just a constant feeling of discomfort. It's worse at the end of the day, after I've been teaching for hours. And, um, it feels a bit warm to the touch, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that’s worse at the end of the day, and warm to the touch… good observations. Now, let's talk about this fluttering sensation you mentioned earlier, the one the nurse referred to. Can you describe exactly what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It’s like… my heart is skipping a beat, or beating too fast. It doesn’t happen all the time. Sometimes I don't even notice it. But when it does happen, it’s a bit unsettling. Like a fish flapping about, maybe? It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds or minutes. It's just... not a regular beat, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, a fish flapping about, not a regular beat. That’s a helpful description. And how often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's difficult to say. Maybe once or twice a week? Sometimes not at all for a few days, then a couple of times in one day. It doesn’t seem to follow a pattern, really. It happened this morning when I was getting ready for work, I believe. But I didn’t mention it to the nurse.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent, once or twice a week, sometimes not at all. It happened this morning. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation before, or has anyone ever mentioned anything about an irregular heartbeat to you prior to this instance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A different doctor, about a year ago, told me I had atrial fibrillation. He prescribed me some pills, but I stopped taking them after a few months. They didn't seem to be doing much, and, well, I forgot to refill the prescription. It hasn't been bothering me much since, until now. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, medication that was discontinued. That's important information. And do you recall why the doctor prescribed the medication?
PATIENT: He said it was to slow my heart down and prevent... well, he said something about blood clots, but I didn’t really understand it all. He said the fluttering could be dangerous. I think. I’m sorry, I don't have the best memory for medical things. It was a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nixon. It is a lot to take in, and you shouldn't apologize for not remembering everything. Preventing blood clots is a valid concern with atrial fibrillation. Now, aside from the medication you mentioned, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't take anything regularly. Just the occasional paracetamol if I have a headache, but that’s it. I try to stay healthy and eat well. I drink a lot of water, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other regular medications. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've never smoked. My parents were both smokers, but they always warned me about it. I've always avoided it. It smells dreadful, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing more than that, Doctor. I don’t really enjoy it much, to be honest. Just a social thing, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. Now, finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had heart problems later in life. She had a weak heart, I think. She passed away a few years ago. And my father had high blood pressure. He’s still alive, but he’s quite old now. Nothing else I can think of, really. They both lived to be quite old, despite their problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart problems, father with high blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. Thank you, Nixon, for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright. We’ll check your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your leg to assess the swelling. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s making it hard to walk, and I worry it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, if you could sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I am. Is there anything special I should be doing? Like, hold my breath or anything?
DOCTOR: No, nothing like that at this stage. Just relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. This might feel a little cool. Hmm… I’m hearing an irregular rhythm, as expected, consistent with atrial fibrillation. Your heart rate is a bit elevated as well, around 98 beats per minute. Your lungs sound clear. And your leg is warm to the touch, with some tenderness on palpation. I don’t feel any significant hardness or clotting, which is good. There is pitting edema present, meaning it leaves an indentation when I press on it. Let me measure the circumference of your leg to get a baseline. Okay, your left leg is approximately 5 centimeters larger in circumference than your right leg. That confirms the swelling is significant. Alright, Nixon. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, we’re dealing with atrial fibrillation that is likely contributing to the swelling in your left leg. The swelling could be due to fluid retention related to the irregular heartbeat. It is important to determine the cause of the swelling, and rule out more serious conditions, like a blood clot. I want to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to have any tests you think are necessary. It's a relief to know you're taking it seriously. What sort of tests are we talking about? And… will they be painful? I do get a bit anxious about needles, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, many people feel anxious about needles, and we'll take things at your pace. The tests I'm recommending are a complete blood count to look at your overall blood health, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a D-dimer to help rule out a blood clot in your leg. We'll also do an electrocardiogram to get a more detailed look at your heart’s electrical activity. The blood tests will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually quite quick. The ECG is completely painless – we just place some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. We'll also need to consider a lower leg ultrasound to look for any signs of a blood clot. That is also painless, though may be slightly uncomfortable due to the pressure. Do those tests sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, those sound alright. I understand why they’re necessary, and I’m willing to have them. The ultrasound sounds a bit worrying, but if it’s to rule out a blood clot, then it’s worth it. Will the results take long to come back? And… will I need to come back for another appointment to discuss them? I have students to teach, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand about your students. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours, and the ultrasound report usually takes a little longer, perhaps a day or two. I can arrange for you to receive a call with the results as soon as they are available. I would like to see you for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail and create a treatment plan. Would a week from today work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a week from today would be fine. That gives me time to arrange things with my classes. Thank you for being so understanding. Is there anything I should be doing now, while I’m waiting for the tests? Any symptoms I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I can help. While you’re waiting for the tests, it's important to stay hydrated. Continue to drink plenty of water. Pay close attention to your leg. If you notice any sudden increase in pain, redness, warmth, or swelling, or if you develop shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. These could be signs of a blood clot or other serious condition. Also, try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting, if possible. Gentle walking is okay, but avoid any strenuous activity. Finally, if you experience any dizziness, lightheadedness, or palpitations that are significantly worse than usual, please contact me right away. Do you have any questions about those instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, those instructions are very clear. Thank you. I’ll make sure to drink plenty of water, watch out for any changes in my leg, and contact you if anything worsens. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I’m here if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in to draw your blood and schedule your ultrasound. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
