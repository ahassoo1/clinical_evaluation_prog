DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, it’s this bruising. It’s just... been getting worse, and I’m on blood thinners, so it’s kinda worrying me. I don't usually bruise like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s getting worse, especially while on blood thinners, is definitely something we want to take a look at. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It started, I guess, about a week ago? Just little ones, you know, like from bumping into stuff. But now… even just from, like, wearing a backpack, I’ll get a big one. They’re mostly on my arms and legs, but I noticed a small one on my stomach yesterday. It's just… a lot more than usual. I haven’t changed anything, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started about a week ago with minor bruising after small bumps, and now it's happening more easily and in more places, including your stomach. You haven't noticed any changes in your routine or anything that might explain it?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing I can think of. Same backpack, same clothes… I haven’t started any new medications or anything. Honestly, that's what’s freaking me out. I take the blood thinner every day, same dose, same time. It’s just… out of the blue.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, what blood thinner are you taking, and what dose are you on?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s… Warfarin. 5 milligrams every evening. I’ve been on it for, gosh, about three years now. My old doctor started me on it after… well, after the clot. But like I said, I haven’t changed anything about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin 5mg daily for three years. Good, that’s helpful. And you said this started about a week ago?
PATIENT: Yep, about a week ago. Maybe a little longer, honestly. It was gradual, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly when. It just… steadily got worse each day. I figured I’d better come in when I noticed one on my stomach. That felt different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I’ve been a little more tired, maybe? But I always chalk that up to working too much. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, no weird headaches… nothing else. Just the bruising, and being a little more tired than usual. Honestly, I'm a bit of a workaholic, so the tiredness isn’t new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no bleeding elsewhere, no headaches, just the increased bruising and a bit of fatigue. Let’s do a quick exam, and then we’ll talk about some possible next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I really don't want to mess with the blood thinner, you know? It keeps me safe.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we'll figure this out. It’s good you're proactive about it. Okay, if you don't mind, could you roll up your sleeves and loosen your pants legs a bit?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There you go. Is there anything else I should do? I'm a little nervous, honestly. I don't usually get this bruised, and it's kinda scaring me.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the bruising on your arms and legs, and the one you mentioned on your stomach. They do vary in color, which is consistent with different ages of bruises. I don't feel any significant swelling or tenderness with palpation, which is reassuring. Your skin feels normal otherwise. Can you tell me if any of these bruises were associated with a specific injury that you remember?
PATIENT: Hmmm… that’s the thing. Not really. Like I said, the backpack, maybe? But it wasn’t a hard bump or anything. A couple of them… I honestly don’t remember how I got them. Just noticed them one day. Which is why I’m worried! Usually, if I bump something, I know I bumped something. But these… they just appeared. It's kinda creepy, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no clear recollection of specific injuries for many of these. That’s definitely something we need to investigate. I’m going to order some blood work. We'll check your INR, of course, to see how well your Warfarin is working, but also some other tests to look for any other possible causes of unexplained bruising. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just… I'm hoping it's not anything serious. I got a lot on my plate right now, and I really don't need this. The blood work sounds smart. Can I still go to work after? I really need the money.
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood work shouldn't prevent you from going to work. It's just a standard draw, and you should be able to resume your normal activities afterward. I'll also want to review your medical history a little more thoroughly - if you don't mind, I'll take a look on the computer here. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um, no, no allergies. Nothing I know of, anyway. My old doctor always checked, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. It's just... the bruising. I'm really hoping it's something simple, like maybe the Warfarin level is off. I got a big deadline coming up at work, and I really can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. Let me pull up your records here... Okay, I see you were diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis three years ago, which is why you were started on Warfarin. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That's right, the DVT. That was scary. Um… no, not really. I have high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. And… I had my gallbladder out a few years ago, but that was no big deal. Honestly, I’m pretty healthy. I eat pretty well, I try to exercise when I can, and I usually just push through everything. It’s just the bruising. It's freaking me out, I guess. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, so controlled hypertension and a previous cholecystectomy. No other significant medical history. And you’re on medication for your blood pressure as well, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, Lisinopril. 20 milligrams every morning. Like I said, it keeps the blood pressure good. I have it checked regularly. But like I said, I haven't changed anything. It's just… this bruising. It's really the only thing that's different. Is it something serious? I'm trying not to panic, but... you know?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Courtnye. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. It’s good that your blood pressure is controlled. Okay, so we’ve covered a lot. Let's recap: You're on Warfarin and Lisinopril, you have a history of DVT and gallbladder removal, and you've recently developed unexplained bruising that's more significant than usual. We're ordering blood work to check your INR and other potential causes. While we wait for those results, I want you to be mindful of any new symptoms – any bleeding anywhere, unusual fatigue, or anything that feels off. If you notice anything concerning, please call us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Recapping it like that… it is a lot. I’ll keep an eye out for anything new, and I’ll call if something’s wrong. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. I just want to feel normal again. When should I expect to hear back about the blood work? And can I still go to work today?
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab usually gets the results back within 24-48 hours. We'll call you as soon as we have them to discuss next steps. And yes, you can absolutely go to work today, as long as you feel up to it. Just be mindful of any bumps or injuries, and let me know if anything changes. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Yoshino. I really appreciate your help. I'm still worried, but I feel a little better knowing we're looking into it. I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your worry, and we will figure this out. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any questions. Have a good day, and try not to stress too much. We'll be in touch soon.
