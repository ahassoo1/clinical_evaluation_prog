DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 58 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 58, though I feel older some days. It’s this bruising, really. It’s… well, it’s excessive, don’t you think? I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and I keep finding these spots. It's quite bothersome, and frankly, a little worrying. I usually don’t bother with small things, but this seems different.
DOCTOR: Bruising, yes. And you mentioned being on a blood thinner. I see. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Well, it’s a blood thinner. The doctor – old Dr. Hemmings, retired now – put me on it a few years back. Something about… clots. I don’t remember the specifics, honestly. I just take the little pills every day. A blue one, I think. Warfarin, maybe? It’s been a while. I suppose I should pay more attention, but I leave that sort of thing to the professionals. It’s just… I bump into things, you know? But this is more than a normal bump.
DOCTOR: Right. Warfarin is quite common. It sounds as though you’ve been on it for some time. And you say this bruising is beyond what you’d expect with typical minor injuries?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I’m not a clumsy man, Doctor. I used to be quite athletic, you know. But even when I do knock something over – which isn't often – it’s never been like this. These bruises… they’re large, dark, and they seem to appear out of nowhere. I haven’t even felt hitting myself sometimes. And they last… longer than they should, I think. It's just… unsettling. Frankly, it makes me look like I’ve been in a fight. Not a good look for a pathologist, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: A pathologist, yes. I see. Well, we’ll certainly get to the bottom of this. Now, let's try to be a bit more precise. Roughly how long have you noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It hasn't been sudden, not exactly. I suppose it started… maybe a month ago? At first, I just chalked it up to getting older, you know? But then it started happening more frequently. And the bruises themselves were bigger. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact date. I don’t spend my days documenting every little bump and bruise, Doctor. I have autopsies to perform. Though, perhaps I should have. It's just… one thing leads to another, and I kept putting it off.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, let's move on to other things then. Have you noticed any bleeding elsewhere?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Other than the bruises, you mean? Not really. My gums bleed a little when I brush, maybe more than they used to, but I always figured that was just… gums. And I get the occasional nosebleed, but those are infrequent, and I live in a dry climate. Nothing that’s caused any real alarm. No blood in my stool, no blood in my urine, nothing like that. I assure you, Doctor, I'm not falling apart. I just don't want to end up looking like a walking map.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this bruising?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? And my appetite hasn't been quite what it used to be, but again, that could be anything. I'm getting older, Doctor. Things wear down. It’s a natural process. I haven't noticed anything… dramatic. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, no severe headaches. Just a general feeling of… being a bit run down. It’s probably just the summer heat.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… quite a while ago. And I had a bout of pneumonia in my forties, but recovered fully. Aside from that, nothing major. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, despite the occasional autopsy. High blood pressure, maybe, a few years back, but it was well-controlled with medication. I stopped taking the medication a while ago, at Dr. Hemmings’ suggestion. He said I didn’t need it anymore. He was a good doctor, that man. Thorough. I miss having someone look after these things properly. I’m not one to complain, but… it's all a bit unsettling, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the warfarin?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains, if needed. Nothing regular. And a multivitamin, I suppose. That's about it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, Doctor. I’ve seen enough of what they can do, being in my profession. They often cause more problems than they solve. I prefer to let nature take its course, as much as possible. Though, clearly, something isn’t quite right at the moment. Which is why I’m here, isn't it? It's just... the thought of having to become reliant on a whole cocktail of drugs… it doesn't appeal to me.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, I think it’s time we perform a physical examination. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at the bruising. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… be gentle, Doctor. I'm not as resilient as I used to be. And try not to poke too much at the bruises. They're rather tender, you know. I've already had to explain a few of them to my housekeeper. She’s quite… inquisitive. It's probably for the best to get this sorted out quickly. It's just... all this poking and prodding... it makes me feel like a specimen. And I do enough of that at work. But yes, proceed. Just be mindful.
DOCTOR: Of course. If you would be so kind as to lie down on the table, we can begin. And I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. Now, let's start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, Doctor, my blood pressure tends to rise when I’m subjected to medical examinations. It’s a perfectly natural reaction, I assure you. A perfectly rational response to being prodded and poked. But please, proceed. Just… try not to startle me. It wouldn’t be a good look for either of us. And do tell me if you find anything… alarming. Though I suspect it’s nothing more than old age catching up with me. Still, best to be thorough, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Farson, but not alarmingly so. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. Your breathing sounds a little… restricted, but again, nothing that's immediately concerning. Now, may I examine the areas where you've noticed the bruising?
PATIENT: Very well. Go ahead. Though, as I mentioned, it might be a bit tender. And please, try not to press too hard. I don't want to end up with any new bruises to worry about. It's a vicious cycle, you know. One bruise leads to another, and before you know it, you look like you've been in a brawl. Not a good look for a pathologist. Especially when you're expected to be… objective. Objective, that's the key. And it's rather difficult to be objective when you're covered in purple splotches. Just… be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: The bruising does appear quite extensive, Mr. Farson. There is tenderness to palpation, as you mentioned, and a variation in age of the ecchymoses. I’m also noting some petechiae on your lower extremities. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to investigate the cause of this bruising. A complete blood count, a coagulation panel, and a metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, you say? More poking and prodding? More vials of my life essence being drained away? Very well. If you insist. Though I must confess, I’m not a fan of needles. It’s a perfectly rational fear, I assure you. And I’ve seen what blood can do, being in my profession. It’s… unsettling. But yes, proceed. Just… try to be quick about it. And please, tell me what you’re looking for. I’d like to understand the purpose of all this… invasive investigation. Just… don’t tell me it’s anything serious. I haven’t got time for serious. Autopsies await. And I’m rather fond of my housekeeping staff. I wouldn't want to worry them. So, please, tell me it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: We are simply looking to rule out any underlying causes for the excessive bruising, Mr. Farson. It could be a number of things, and blood work is the best way to determine what’s going on. We will check your blood cell counts, assess your clotting ability, and evaluate your overall organ function. It is unlikely to be anything serious, but it is important to investigate thoroughly. Now, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help reduce the risk of further bruising. We'll talk about avoiding injury, being careful with sharp objects, and… managing any underlying medical conditions. It’s a preventative measure, Mr. Farson. A sensible approach. And it will alleviate some of your anxiety, I assure you.
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? You mean… I’m supposed to be more careful? With sharp objects? Doctor, I’ve been performing autopsies for thirty years. I think I have a fairly good grasp of sharp object safety. And avoiding injury? Well, that’s a given, isn’t it? I’m not actively seeking out ways to inflict harm upon myself. It’s rather… condescending, frankly. Suggesting I need to be more careful. And managing underlying conditions? What conditions are you referring to? I thought we were discussing bruising, not… a complete overhaul of my life. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think you doctors just make things up as you go along. It's all rather… vague. And it doesn’t address the underlying issue. What’s causing the bruising? That’s what I want to know. Not a lecture on sharp object safety. So, please, let’s focus on the blood work. And then, perhaps, you can explain what’s really going on.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I assure you, I am not attempting to lecture you. My intention is to provide comprehensive care, and that includes addressing potential contributing factors to your condition. While I understand your expertise in the medical field, it is important to remember that you are the patient in this situation. The blood work will provide valuable information, and once we have the results, we can discuss the underlying cause and formulate a treatment plan. For now, let's proceed with the blood draw, and then we can revisit this conversation. I assure you, I will do my best to answer your questions and address your concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Well, yes, actually. What exactly are you looking for in this blood work? Be specific. And what’s the turnaround time? I have autopsies to perform, you know. I can’t be waiting around indefinitely for results. And finally… is there anything I should be doing now? Anything at all? Other than being careful with sharp objects, of course. It's just… I’d like to be proactive. And I’d appreciate a straight answer. No vague pronouncements about lifestyle modifications. Just… the facts. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. I will be as specific as possible. We will be assessing your platelet count, which is essential for blood clotting. We’ll also be looking at your coagulation factors – proteins that are necessary for the clotting process. Additionally, we will evaluate your complete blood count to check for any underlying anemia or infection. The turnaround time is typically 24-48 hours, but I will expedite the results as much as possible. And in the meantime, the only thing I would recommend is to avoid any strenuous activity and to monitor yourself closely for any signs of excessive bleeding. If you notice any bleeding that is difficult to stop, please seek immediate medical attention. Now, are there any other questions?
PATIENT: Excessive bleeding… yes, that’s a sensible precaution. I suppose. And I can certainly avoid strenuous activity. Autopsies don’t exactly require a great deal of physical exertion. Mostly it’s… precision. And a strong stomach. But what about… supplements? Should I avoid those? I take a multivitamin, as I mentioned, but could that be interfering with the clotting process? And what about… alcohol? Should I abstain from my nightly glass of wine? It helps me relax after a long day of dissecting… well, never mind. Just tell me, Doctor, is there anything I should absolutely avoid? Anything at all that could exacerbate the situation? Just… be specific. Please. I'm a pathologist, you see. I appreciate clarity.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, while a multivitamin is unlikely to interfere significantly with the clotting process, I would recommend temporarily discontinuing all supplements until we have the results of the blood work. And yes, it would be prudent to abstain from alcohol as well, as it can thin the blood and potentially worsen the bleeding. Ultimately, the best course of action is to err on the side of caution and avoid any substances or activities that could exacerbate the situation. Once we have the results of the blood work, we can provide more specific recommendations. Now, I believe we’ve covered everything for the moment. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please let me know if you have any further questions. And try to relax, Mr. Farson. We will get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Very well. Relax, you say? Easier said than done, Doctor. But I shall endeavor to remain calm. And I shall abstain from alcohol and supplements, as you’ve advised. Though I make no promises regarding the autopsy schedule. Dead bodies don’t keep. And I suppose… I shall attempt to avoid sharp objects. Though that’s rather fundamental to my profession. Very well. I shall await the results. And I expect a prompt response. I have a life, you know. Or, what’s left of one. Please, inform me as soon as you have any news. And thank you… for your time. .
