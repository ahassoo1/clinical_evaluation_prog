DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... fitness check. For referee work. Need paper say I okay. Quick, if possible?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness check for your referee work – I understand. We’ll do our best to make this as efficient as possible while still ensuring a thorough assessment. To start, could you elaborate a little on what specifically this check needs to cover?
PATIENT: Um... running. Some push-ups. Maybe... balance? The league, they have list. I bring it. Here. This what they want.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Let’s see… cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, agility, and balance. Yes, this is quite specific. It appears they’ve outlined a fairly comprehensive assessment. Before we begin the physical components, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Okay. Health... I okay. No big problems. Bit tired sometimes, work hard. Lift heavy things. That all. Been... two years since wife... pass. Hard time then, but now... better. I think. No doctor before this. Just... check for work. That's it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It takes considerable strength to navigate such a loss, and it’s perfectly normal to experience periods of fatigue, especially after a significant life event. It’s good that you’re prioritizing your health now. Just to clarify for my records, when you say you lift heavy things, could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Refractory. I fix inside of ovens. Big industry ovens. Very hot. Lots lifting bricks, special stones. Heavy. All day. And... running between jobs sometimes. Not far, but quick. Need be fast. Hot work.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Mr. Shanor. That provides a much clearer picture of your physical demands. Working with industrial ovens sounds quite strenuous, particularly in the heat. Now, to move forward with the assessment, let’s begin with a brief review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – for example, high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. No problems. Like I say, never see doctor before this. Wife always healthy too. Strong woman. Just… always okay. No sickness. No nothing.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just water. Lots of water. Because hot. Need water. Can we… do the running now? I have work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. We can proceed with the physical assessment. Before we begin, are you experiencing any pain or discomfort at the moment—anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: No pain. Maybe… little sore in back sometimes. After long day. But okay. Just… old. Not big problem. Work make it. Not injury. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. Nothing. Wife too. Both strong. Can we… get this done? The running? I want to finish quick.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Shanor. I understand your desire to be efficient. Let’s begin with a quick cardiovascular assessment. I’d like you to walk briskly for about five minutes, and I’ll monitor your heart rate and breathing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Walking is good. Quick walking? Let's do it. The quicker the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll follow me, we have a short hallway we can use. I'll be observing you from here. Please let me know if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other discomfort during the walk. We'll start now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor, please stop walking. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Little tired. But okay. Hot in here. Normal tired. Work tired. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Your pulse is slightly elevated, which is expected after exertion, but within a reasonable range. Your breathing is also a bit faster than normal, but that’s also typical. For documentation purposes, I’m noting a heart rate of 92 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute immediately following the walk. Now, let's move on to the muscular strength assessment. I’d like you to perform some push-ups, if you’re able. How many do you think you can comfortably do?
PATIENT: Maybe... ten? Not do many push-ups. Lifting heavy things. More important. Ten is good start? Can stop if too hard.
DOCTOR: Ten is a good starting point, Mr. Shanor. Absolutely, stop whenever you feel any discomfort. Alright, if you're ready, please begin. I'll be watching to ensure proper technique. Remember to keep your back straight and core engaged.
PATIENT: Done. Ten. Little hard. Back… little sore now.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting that you completed ten push-ups with moderate effort and some reported discomfort in your lower back. Your form was adequate, but with some fatigue towards the end. Now, let's assess your balance. Could you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay. Balance… Little hard. Can't stand still. Maybe… not good balance.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Shanor. It's common to have some difficulty with balance when closing your eyes. I'm noting that you experienced some instability after 15 seconds and opened your eyes. To further assess, could you try walking in a straight line, heel-to-toe, for ten steps?
PATIENT: Okay. Heel-to-toe… No. Can't do it. Too hard. Bad balance. Is that enough? Can we finish now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Shanor, that is enough. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on my assessment, you demonstrate some difficulty with both static and dynamic balance. You also reported some lower back discomfort during and after the push-ups. Now, I need to discuss my findings with you. Your cardiovascular health appears within normal limits for your age and activity level. However, the lower back discomfort and difficulty with balance are concerning. While it may be related to your physically demanding work, it is important to rule out any underlying musculoskeletal issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Musculo… what? Is that bad? Can I still referee? The league… they need me. Can I still do the job? That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: "Musculoskeletal" refers to your muscles, bones, and joints, Mr. Shanor. It's not necessarily "bad," but it warrants further investigation. The difficulty with balance and back discomfort could potentially affect your ability to perform your duties as a referee safely and effectively. I recommend a consultation with a physical therapist for a comprehensive evaluation. They can assess the specific cause of your back discomfort and balance issues and develop a tailored treatment plan to help you regain strength, stability, and function. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activities that exacerbate your symptoms, such as heavy lifting or prolonged standing. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Referral. Need work. Need referee. Can I still do… small games? Before I see… physical what-you-call-it? Just small ones. Not big. Just to keep going.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. I’ll prepare a referral for a physical therapist specializing in sports-related injuries. I will also include notes detailing your assessment results. Regarding your question about continuing to referee small games, I understand your desire to remain active. However, I must advise caution. Performing activities that aggravate your back discomfort or balance issues could potentially worsen your condition and delay your recovery. I recommend discussing this specifically with the physical therapist during your evaluation. They can provide personalized guidance based on their assessment of your condition. It's best to err on the side of safety and avoid any activities that could pose a risk to your health. To summarize, I will provide you with a referral to a physical therapist, and I recommend avoiding strenuous activities until you have been evaluated. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Referral… good. Can I… go now? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Shanor. Yes, you may go now. I will have the referral printed and given to you by the receptionist on your way out. Please remember to schedule an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, numbness, or weakness, please contact my office immediately. Thank you again for coming in, and I wish you a speedy recovery.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
