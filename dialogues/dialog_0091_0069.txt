DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiо. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, if that’s right. I think it was recommended to me a while back, and I finally got around to scheduling it. I believe it's just a standard one, but I wasn’t sure which one exactly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me pull up your file here… Ah, yes. It appears you’re due for the Tdap booster, as well as the annual influenza vaccine. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Tdap and the flu one, right. Okay, good. No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Is there anything I should be worried about, even if I haven’t had problems before? Just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. While severe reactions are rare, it’s always prudent to be informed. With the Tdap vaccine, you might experience some mild soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, and possibly a low-grade fever or fatigue for a day or two. These are usually self-limiting and respond well to over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. The influenza vaccine can sometimes cause similar, mild side effects, but generally, it’s very well-tolerated. Are you currently feeling unwell in any way – fever, cough, body aches?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all, Doctor. Feeling perfectly fine, actually. Just a bit tired from work, but that's normal. Soreness and maybe a little tired sounds alright, honestly. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. So, we're doing both today then? The Tdap and the flu shot?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, that’s correct. We can administer both vaccines today, which is perfectly safe and convenient. It's good to be proactive about your health. Before we proceed, let me quickly review your medical history. Just to confirm, have you had any significant changes in your health since your last visit, any new diagnoses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No changes at all, Doctor. Everything's been pretty steady. No new diagnoses, thankfully, and I haven’t been to the hospital. Just the usual check-ups with my primary care doctor. I try to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear. And just to confirm, your height is listed as 155 centimeters and your weight as 91 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Those numbers sound about right, yes. I haven't weighed myself recently, but that sounds accurate.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, Mr. Paguiо. If you’ll just please roll up your sleeves, we can get started. I’ll administer the Tdap vaccine in one arm, and the influenza vaccine in the other. Please let me know immediately if you feel any unusual discomfort. We'll start with the Tdap.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. No problem at all. Let's get it done. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, you might feel a brief pinch. There you go. That was the Tdap. Now, just a moment while I prepare the influenza vaccine. And that completes the influenza vaccine. You may experience some mild soreness at both injection sites over the next few days. How are you feeling currently?
PATIENT: Not bad, Doctor. Just a little pinch, like you said. A little sore already, but nothing major. I think I can handle it. Thanks for letting me know what to expect. How long should I stay here just to make sure I don't have a reaction? I don't want to rush off and then something happen.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It’s always best to be cautious. We typically ask patients to remain in the clinic for 15-20 minutes after vaccination to monitor for any immediate adverse reactions, although severe reactions are quite rare. We’ll have you wait here for that period, and if you feel any unusual symptoms – difficulty breathing, hives, swelling of the face or throat, dizziness – please let us know immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today, or any questions you have before we finish?
PATIENT: Fifteen to twenty minutes sounds good. I appreciate that. No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. Thank you for your help. I feel much better now that I've gotten those done. Just hoping I don't get too sore later!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paguiо. I’m glad I could help. We'll keep an eye on you for the next fifteen minutes. If you do experience any significant discomfort after you leave, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here is a pamphlet with some helpful information about potential side effects and what to do if you experience them. Otherwise, have a pleasant day, and please take care. I’ll check back with you shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate it. And you have a good day too.
