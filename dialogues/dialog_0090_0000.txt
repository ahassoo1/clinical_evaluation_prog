DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's this weakness in my legs. It just came on suddenly, after I had a pretty bad cold last week. Honestly, it’s quite bothersome. I usually don’t bother doctors for just anything, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I appreciate you coming in despite your usual… preferences. "Suddenly," you say. Can you describe this weakness for me?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It’s not like I can't walk, but it feels like I'm wading through mud, if that makes any sense. Like my legs are just… heavy. And it’s both of them, which is what's so strange. Normally, if something’s bothering me, it’s just one side, you know? This is… unsettling. It's worse when I first get up, then it eases a little, but it never really goes away completely.
DOCTOR: “Heavy,” and worse in the morning… and it affects both legs equally. Interesting. And you said this started after a cold?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A really nasty one, actually. Achy all over, stuffy nose, the works. I thought it was just lingering weakness from being sick, but it hasn’t improved at all. It’s been almost a week now, and frankly, I’m starting to worry. I have things to do, you know? I can't be slowed down by a bit of a cold. It just doesn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, lingering cold symptoms can sometimes cause muscle aches, but a week is a bit prolonged for that. Do you have any fever now?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I checked myself yesterday, just to be sure. And like I said, it's not pain, exactly. It’s just… difficult. It’s like trying to lift weights with every step. And it’s… frustrating. I've always been very active, I keep myself in good shape. This is just… a nuisance, really. I don’t usually complain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re not one to complain. Let’s go through a little bit more detail. Aside from this weakness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. My hands are fine, everything else seems to be working normally. No numbness, no tingling, no dizziness. My bladder and bowel are functioning as usual. I haven’t fallen or anything like that. It really is just my legs. It’s just… odd. And bothersome. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Right. No other neurological symptoms. You mentioned being active. What sort of activities do you typically engage in?
PATIENT: Well, I lead tours, mostly walking tours of the city. It keeps me on my feet all day. And I do a little gardening. Nothing strenuous, but enough to keep me moving, you understand. I used to do a bit more hiking, but my schedule doesn’t allow for it much anymore. But I'm certainly not inactive. I take pride in my health, Doctor. This isn't something I would just invent.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your diligence with your health, Ms. Firestone. It’s good to have a sense of your activity level. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, nothing serious. I had a hysterectomy years ago, but that was all straightforward. And I was briefly married, but that was a mistake best forgotten. No family history of anything major either, as far as I know. My mother lived to be eighty-five, and she was quite spry right up until the end. Really, I don’t see why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy… okay. And no family history of neurological issues, diabetes, or significant medical conditions. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes ibuprofen for a headache, if needed. Nothing regular, nothing significant. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. It always seems to cause more problems than it solves. I really don’t understand why I’m even here, honestly. This is just a bit of leg weakness. It'll probably go away on its own. I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow, you see… it’s rather important.
DOCTOR: Right. Just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Well, Ms. Firestone, while it may seem like "just leg weakness," we need to rule out anything serious. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. It won't take long. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam? Really? I thought we were just… talking. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what good poking and prodding will do. But, fine. If you insist. Just please be gentle. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. I can’t be limping around.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Now, the other leg. Okay. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? Honestly, Doctor, this is all a bit unnecessary. I assure you, my grip is perfectly fine. I carry things all day, you know. It's hardly a surprise I can squeeze your hand. I’m starting to feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip is adequate. Now, can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. Of course, I can. I'm not numb, if that's what you're implying. Honestly, this is rather… patronizing. I know my own body, Doctor. I'm not some helpless invalid. Is there a point to all of this, or are we just… wasting time? My tour is tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your frustration. However, it’s my job to rule out potential causes for your weakness. Your reflexes are normal, and you have adequate strength. Now, I'd like you to stand up and walk for me, heel-to-toe, for a short distance. It will help me assess your gait. Please, just a few steps.
PATIENT: Fine. But if I fall, it's your responsibility. Honestly, this is ridiculous. There. Happy? I’m walking. Perfectly normally, I might add. Though it is a bit undignified. Can we please get this over with?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your gait is a little unsteady. Now, could you please sit back down?
PATIENT: Must we? I’m starting to ache. And this chair isn’t particularly comfortable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a busy woman. I have things to do. Just tell me what you think it is, so I can get on with my day. I haven’t got all afternoon for this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, based on your description and my exam, it’s difficult to say definitively. However, the sudden onset of weakness after a cold, coupled with the mild instability in your gait, suggests a possible post-viral neuropathy or, less likely, early signs of peripheral neuropathy. It’s important to rule out other possibilities, like vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function tests. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. While it may be nothing serious, it’s best to be thorough. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity, and if the weakness worsens or you develop any new symptoms, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood work… a neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, that seems a bit extreme for a bit of leg weakness. I’ve never needed a neurologist in my life. And vitamin deficiencies? I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. But… fine. If you insist. But I'm not promising I'll go to a neurologist. And frankly, if this interferes with my tour tomorrow, I'll be quite upset. So, just tell me how to get this blood work done. And how long will it take? I don't have time for endless waiting rooms. I'll need a written excuse for work, too, just in case. And the tests had better not interfere with my schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand your concerns. The lab is located on the ground floor of the hospital. You don't need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Kur sent you. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. I can write you a note excusing you from strenuous activity for a week, just to be on the safe side. And regarding the neurologist, I will give you a referral, but you can schedule the appointment at your convenience. It’s best to get it checked out sooner rather than later, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Here is the referral and the lab requisition. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. A week? That's rather disruptive. But fine. I'll get the blood work done, I suppose. And I'll consider the neurologist. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. Thank you for… your time, Doctor. Though I can’t say I’m particularly impressed. I hope this doesn't interfere with my tour. .
