DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. There’s some swelling, yes. It’s mostly… on this side of my face, I believe. <gestures vaguely to the left side of his face> It came on rather gradually, and honestly, I haven’t a clear recollection of when exactly it started. It’s just… there now.
DOCTOR: Gradually, you say. Hmm. And when you say “swelling,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s not… painful, not exactly. More… puffiness, I suppose. Around my jawline, and a little bit under my eye here. <touches the area under his left eye gently> It feels… softer than usual, if that makes any sense. I’ve tried a cool compress a few times, but it doesn’t seem to have much effect, truthfully. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Tomassoni. These things happen. Puffiness around the jawline and under the eye… has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… <pauses, tapping his chin> I believe I’ve been… more tired than usual, perhaps? And… sometimes, a slight pressure in my ear on this side as well. <points to his left ear> But it's fleeting, really. Nothing consistent, and it might not even be related. I truly wish I could provide more clarity, Doctor. It feels like trying to recall a dream.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and occasional pressure in the ear… Have you noticed any changes in your vision, any difficulty opening your mouth, or any numbness or tingling in your face?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no changes in my vision at all. And I can open my mouth… normally, I think. <attempts a wide mouth opening, then winces slightly> Perhaps a little stiff, but nothing alarming. No numbness or tingling, either. It’s… peculiar. Everything feels so… subtle. Like it’s happening at a distance, if that makes any sense. I hope I’m not being too difficult.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being difficult at all. It's good you're describing everything so carefully, even the subtle things. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: That’s… a little tricky, Doctor. I’ve seen a few specialists over the years, mostly for… general fatigue and headaches. I believe one mentioned something about mild allergies, but I don't recall specifics. Honestly, my records are scattered, and I haven't been terribly diligent in keeping track. I apologize again. I am usually quite organized, but… things have been hazy recently. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and headaches… and a daily multivitamin. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. No hospitalizations either. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but it was treated at home. Nothing serious, truly. I've always been fairly… robust, until recently. This swelling is quite unlike anything I’ve experienced. I do recall a minor dental procedure—a filling, perhaps—but that was years ago, and I doubt it’s connected. I feel I'm rambling, Doctor. Please, feel free to steer the conversation. I simply wish to be helpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Tomassoni. It's good to get a full picture. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… <pauses, looking slightly distant> My mother, she passed away several years ago. She had… heart troubles, I believe. My father is still living, but we are not particularly close. He resides in Morocco, and we rarely speak. As for medical history… I'm afraid I don’t have much information. I wasn’t particularly involved in their healthcare, truthfully. I apologize. I wish I could be more forthcoming, but my recollections are… fragmented. I do recall a cousin, on my mother’s side, who struggled with… skin sensitivity, perhaps? But it was quite some time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart troubles in your mother, skin sensitivity in a cousin… Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol—perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a very… quiet life, Doctor. I work as a speech-language pathologist, and I enjoy reading and spending time outdoors—when the weather permits, of course. I maintain a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I try to get regular exercise, though my energy levels have been rather low recently. I assure you, I am a very… conventional person. <offers a small, somewhat apologetic smile>
DOCTOR: Alright. Conventional, you say. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. As I mentioned earlier, I believe I was told I had mild allergies as a child, but I don’t recall to what specifically. No known reactions to any medications, thankfully. I’ve never experienced any hives, difficulty breathing, or any other alarming symptoms after taking a prescription or over-the-counter drug. I’ve always been rather cautious when it comes to medication, and I always consult with a pharmacist before taking anything new. <pauses> I do have a slight sensitivity to strong perfumes, if that’s relevant. They sometimes trigger a headache, but it's minor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. Well, let’s have a look at the swelling. Please sit up a little straighter for me. <gestures toward the examination chair> I'll need to examine your face and neck.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. <sits up straighter, adjusting his posture> Please, feel free to take your time. I am entirely at your disposal. I do hope you are able to discern the cause of this… discomfort. I've been rather worried about it, truthfully, despite my attempts to remain calm. I trust your expertise implicitly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, tell me, does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: <winces slightly as the doctor touches a spot on his jawline> Yes, just there, actually. A little bit… sensitive, yes. Not excruciating, but definitely noticeable. It feels… almost as if there’s something swollen underneath the skin, if that makes any sense. A subtle pressure, rather than sharp pain. <points to the area the doctor is touching> It's hard to describe precisely. Perhaps it's just my imagination.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: <flinches slightly as the doctor touches a spot on his neck> Oh… yes. There. That’s… a bit more noticeable. It feels… firm. Not particularly painful, but definitely… something is there. It wasn't something I had consciously noticed before, Doctor. A small lump, perhaps? It’s rather unsettling. <touches the area gently> I apologize for being so anxious; I simply dislike the feeling of uncertainty.
DOCTOR: There is some swelling and firmness to the lymph nodes on this side of your neck, Mr. Tomassoni. I also note some mild puffiness around your jawline. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but these findings could indicate a number of things. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to rule out certain possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work to check for infection and inflammation. We'll also need to consider a CT scan of your head and neck to get a better look at what's going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood work? <pauses, looking slightly apprehensive> Yes, Doctor, I understand. It sounds… thorough. I must admit, I am a little worried. But I trust your judgment implicitly. If it's necessary to rule out anything serious, then I’m entirely agreeable. Could you perhaps elaborate on what those “possibilities” might be? I’m not requesting a diagnosis, of course, merely attempting to understand the scope of the investigation. I do appreciate your candor.
DOCTOR: Well, these findings could be due to a simple infection, such as a viral illness or a bacterial infection of the skin. However, we also need to rule out other, less common possibilities, such as swollen salivary glands, or—in rare cases—something more concerning, like a tumor. I want to be upfront with you, Mr. Tomassoni. It's far more likely to be something benign, but we need to investigate to be certain. The blood work will give us a better indication of whether there's an active infection, and the CT scan will allow us to visualize the area and identify any abnormalities. Do you have any questions about the procedures themselves?
PATIENT: A tumor… <pauses, swallowing hard> That is… concerning, naturally. But I understand the necessity of thoroughness, Doctor. I suppose it’s better to know, regardless of the outcome. No, I don't believe I have any questions about the procedures themselves. I've had blood work done before, and I am familiar with CT scans. I simply… hope it is nothing too serious. <looks down at his hands, then back up at the doctor> When can I expect the results? And will you explain them to me in detail? I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. It is reassuring, despite the… unsettling nature of the possibilities.
DOCTOR: The blood work should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The CT scan results usually take a little longer—perhaps three to five business days, depending on the radiologist’s workload. And yes, of course, I will explain everything to you in detail. I won’t leave you in the dark, Mr. Tomassoni. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—such as fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain—please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve been exceptionally thorough and reassuring. I appreciate your candor, and your patience with my… fragmented recollections. I will schedule the blood work immediately, and follow up to schedule the CT scan. And I will certainly contact you immediately should any new symptoms arise. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. <offers a small, grateful smile> I believe that concludes my questions for now. <stands up slowly>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. Get the blood work done as soon as possible. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. <gestures toward the door> Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. We’ll be in touch.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Burlingham. You’ve eased my anxieties considerably. I will contact you promptly with any updates or concerns. Have a pleasant day as well. <exits the office slowly, looking slightly apprehensive>
