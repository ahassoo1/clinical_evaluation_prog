DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a cough. Been on and off for a while now. Dry cough, mostly. Feels like something stuck in my throat sometimes, but nothing really there. It’s been bothering me, especially at night. Don't remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s been on and off, mostly dry, with a feeling of something stuck in your throat, worse at night. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you try to recall roughly how long?
PATIENT: Roughly… oh, goodness. Months, I think? Maybe six? Or was it longer? Time… it all blurs together these days. I just know it hasn't been a recent thing. My wife… she would have remembered the exact date, probably. She was good with dates.
DOCTOR: I understand, it's easy to lose track. Six months is a reasonable timeframe. And has anything changed about the cough recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm. Not that I recall. It’s just… more frequent, maybe? And a little… deeper sounding, perhaps. It doesn’t bring anything up, if you know what I mean. Just a dry, hacking sound. Sometimes it makes my chest feel a little tight, but that doesn't last long. It’s hard to explain. It just is.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent, a deeper sound, no mucus production, and occasional chest tightness. Thank you for clarifying. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I haven't checked my temperature in… well, a very long time. Chills… not that I remember. And night sweats… I always sleep warm, so it's hard to tell the difference, you know? I use a thick quilt. I don't feel sick, exactly. Just… tired, and this cough won't leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or significant night sweats. Just fatigue and the persistent cough. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, wheezing, or pain when you breathe?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… sometimes, when I climb the stairs. But I've always been a little winded, even when I was younger. Wheezing… no, not that I’ve noticed. And pain… no, not really pain. More like… discomfort. A tightness, like I said. It doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… unpleasant. Does that make sense? It’s hard to describe these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Discomfort and tightness, no sharp pain, and some shortness of breath with exertion. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long list, Doctor. I… I don’t remember everything. I had a bad flu when I was a boy, but I recovered. My wife… she handled all the doctor’s appointments and medications. I just… did what she told me. I think I have high blood pressure, maybe? She mentioned it a few times. And my knees… they bother me, but that’s just old age, I suppose. I’m afraid I’m not much help with this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible high blood pressure and some knee problems. We'll try to get a clearer picture. Do you currently take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. Like I said, my wife… she managed everything. After she passed… I just stopped taking them. Didn't know what they were for, exactly. And I didn't want to bother anyone trying to figure it out. Just… easier this way.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food, pollen, or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I used to help my wife in the garden, and she had all sorts of flowers. Never had any trouble with pollen. And we had a cat when we were young, a little tabby. Didn't bother me none. I don't think I have any allergies, Doctor. But, like I said, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Smoking… oh, yes. I used to smoke. A long time ago. When I was younger, working in the factory. Everyone smoked back then. Maybe a pack a day? For… oh, goodness, twenty years, maybe more. I quit… a long time ago, too. When my wife got sick. Didn't want to bother her with it. It's been… decades. I don't even think about it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a significant smoking history in the past, but you quit decades ago. Thank you for being honest about that. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, if you would. My chest feels a little tender, you know?
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and out… good. Again… and out… Okay. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, and your breathing sounds a little diminished on both sides. Your heart rate is a little fast, but regular. There’s some tenderness when I press here on your lower ribs. Alright. Everything sounds a little congested. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. It's reading 92%. That's a little low.
PATIENT: 92…? Is that bad, Doctor? My wife… she always knew what those numbers meant. What does that mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: 92% is a little lower than we like to see, Mr. Pavlovic. It means your blood isn't carrying quite enough oxygen. It could be from a few things, like the congestion in your lungs, or a previous history of smoking. Given your age, your history of smoking, and the congestion I heard, I think it’s important to get a chest X-ray to see what’s going on in your lungs. It’ll help us rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or something else. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: An X-ray…? Oh, goodness. Is it… dangerous? I don’t like hospitals. My wife… she didn’t like them either. Will it hurt? I just want to feel better, Doctor. That’s all. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: No, an X-ray isn’t dangerous, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. It doesn't involve any needles or incisions. It just takes a picture of your lungs. And I understand your concerns about hospitals. We can schedule the X-ray at the clinic itself, so you won't have to go to the hospital. It will take only a few minutes. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an inhaler to help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It's a steroid inhaler and a bronchodilator. It can help with the congestion and wheezing. We'll also start you on a short course of antibiotics, just in case there is an underlying infection. But the X-ray is important to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… and an inhaler… alright. If that will help me breathe easier… and it doesn’t involve going to the hospital… then yes, alright. I’ll do the X-ray. Just… tell me when and where, Doctor. And please, be quick about it. I don’t like being fussed over. And… will the inhaler and antibiotics make me feel better right away?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you agreed to the X-ray. We can do it right here in the clinic, the radiology tech is available this afternoon, at 2:30 PM. The inhaler should provide some relief within a few hours, but it might take a few days to see the full effect. The antibiotics will take a little longer, usually a couple of days, to start working. I'm also going to give you a prescription for a cough suppressant to help you sleep at night. Here are your prescriptions. The pharmacy is just down the street, they'll be able to explain how to use the inhaler and the cough suppressant. I'm going to give you a referral to a pulmonologist for a follow-up appointment after the X-ray, just to be on the safe side. They specialize in lung conditions and can provide more detailed care. Would you like me to schedule that for you?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist… oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. No, no scheduling, thank you. I’ll… I’ll think about it. I just want to get through this cough, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you… for everything. I appreciate it. Can I go now? I’m a little tired.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. You can go now. Please, if your symptoms get worse – if you have a high fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed, including the prescriptions and the X-ray referral. I'll see you back here after the X-ray results are available. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
