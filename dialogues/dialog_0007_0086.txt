DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just here for the results, if we can get straight to it? I’ve got a pretty busy afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, straight to it works for me. Let me just pull up your results here... So, you came in last week with complaints of fatigue and some muscle aches, is that right?
PATIENT: Yep, that's right. And a bit of a headache now and then. Honestly, felt pretty rubbish for a while there. But yeah, just the results please? I’m trying to work out if I need to book time off work.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Your complete blood count came back normal, no signs of infection there. Your thyroid levels are also within the normal range. Vitamin D was a little low, honestly, quite a lot of people are low on that, especially this time of year. But the interesting thing… your Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels are elevated, indicating a past infection. It looks like you had mono at some point, likely a few months ago. Are you familiar with mono?
PATIENT: Mono? Vaguely. Didn't I get that when I was a kid? Like, really tired and a sore throat? Is that what this is showing? Because honestly, I barely remember. Was it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s pretty common to get mono as a kid, and sometimes the symptoms can be mild, so it's easy to forget. Yes, that sounds right. Fatigue and sore throat are classic symptoms. The elevated antibodies just mean your body fought it off at some point. It can cause prolonged fatigue, which is what we’re likely seeing now. It’s rarely serious, but it can be debilitating. Do you remember when you might have been sick like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s tricky. Probably… around February, maybe? I had a really bad cold then, knocked me flat for a week or so. But honestly, I get colds a lot, so I don’t really keep track. Is that long enough ago to be showing up now? I just want to know if I need to worry, or if it's just… one of those things.
DOCTOR: February is definitely enough time for the antibodies to be detectable. It’s not unusual for fatigue to linger for weeks, even months, after mono. We call it post-viral fatigue. Given your symptoms and the results, that’s the most likely explanation. But just to rule out anything else, let’s quickly check your lymph nodes and listen to your lungs. It'll only take a minute. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, go ahead. Quick is good. Honestly, as long as it’s nothing serious, I can deal with being tired for a bit. I’ve just got a lot on, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling. Lungs are clear, breathing sounds are good. Everything sounds and feels good. Given the timeline, your symptoms, and the lab results, I'm confident this is post-viral fatigue following your mono infection in February. It's not serious, but it is annoying. We’ll manage the symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Manage the symptoms... what does that mean, exactly? Pills? Lifestyle stuff? Because I'm not great at lifestyle stuff, if I'm honest. And I really don’t want to be off work.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Pills aren't usually necessary for post-viral fatigue. It's mostly about support. The biggest thing is rest – I know you're busy, but try to prioritize getting enough sleep. Hydration is key too – water, herbal teas, things like that. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with any aches or headaches. And really, listen to your body. If you’re tired, rest. Don't push yourself too hard. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess. Sleep... I can try. Water I can definitely do. Ibuprofen, okay. It’s just… I have a deadline next month, a big one. And if I fall behind… Is there anything else? Anything at all I can take, even if it's just a vitamin? To help me get through it?
DOCTOR: Given your Vitamin D levels are low, supplementing with that could be helpful for energy levels. I'd recommend 2000 IU daily. Beyond that, there are some people who find B-complex vitamins helpful, but the evidence is mixed. It's not going to be a magic bullet, but it’s generally safe to try. We can also check your iron levels if you’re concerned about fatigue, but given your normal blood count, it’s less likely to be the issue. I want to be realistic. This likely won’t resolve overnight. It’s about pacing yourself and being kind to your body while it recovers.
PATIENT: Okay, Vitamin D, got it. And I'll try the B-complex, if it won't hurt. Right, well, that's… helpful. Is there anything else I need to do? Blood tests? Follow-up appointment? I really need to get going soon. .
DOCTOR: We don't need any further blood tests at this time. If your fatigue doesn't improve within a month, or if it gets worse, then definitely come back and we'll reassess. Otherwise, just focus on rest, hydration, and the Vitamin D. Here’s a quick summary of everything we discussed – Vitamin D 2000 IU daily, pacing yourself, and come back if things don’t improve. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
