DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Uh, it’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for… a tryout physical. For a sports team. Gotta get cleared, you know? I just need to get this done if that’s alright, I’ve got a schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. A sports physical. Absolutely. We want to make sure you're in good health for that. Just a routine check-up to ensure you're fit to play. Could you tell me a little bit about the sport you're trying out for?
PATIENT: It's… archery. Yeah, archery. Not too rough, you know? Mostly just… standing and aiming. Though you do walk a bit. But nothing crazy. I’ve been doing it for a while, just haven't had a check-up in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, archery. Good to know. And you said it’s been a while since your last physical?
PATIENT: Yeah, a long while. Honestly, I don't even remember exactly when. Probably… before my divorce? Something like that. A few years, at least. Maybe more. I just haven't really needed to see a doctor much. I feel okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few years, at least. That’s alright. We’ll just get a good baseline today. To start, could you tell me about any current medical problems you might have?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Nothing major, really. My knees sometimes ache a little, especially after standing for too long. And my back… it gets a bit stiff if I sit for too long. But that's just getting old, I guess. Nothing I really do anything about. Just try not to sit too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee and back pain. And when you say ache, can you describe that pain a little more?
PATIENT: Uh, it’s not like a sharp pain. More of a dull ache, you know? Like, I can still walk and stuff, but it just… bothers me after a while. Especially the knees. Feels kinda creaky. And the back is more like stiffness. Like it’s hard to bend over in the morning. Not terrible, just… annoying. Is that helpful? I’m not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Kingan. "Dull ache" and "creaky" gives me a good idea. And the stiffness in the morning is also useful information. Do either of these pains get worse with specific activities?
PATIENT: Well… the knees definitely bother me more after a lot of walking. Like, if I’m doing a lot of errands, or… walking the archery range. And the back… doesn’t really get worse with anything specific, it’s just always kinda there. It's not a bad pain, I just notice it. Honestly, I’m probably making a big deal out of nothing. Sorry. I just want to get this physical done quickly, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not making a big deal out of anything, Mr. Kingan. It’s important to address these things. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I don’t think so anyway. I mean, I’ve been to doctors, but… not much ever came of it. Always healthy, I guess. Blood pressure… they checked it sometimes, I think? Never said anything was wrong. I really don’t remember much, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Never really needed to. Maybe some ibuprofen sometimes, if I have a headache. But that’s it. And not even regularly. Like, once or twice a year. Barely anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I think I’d remember that, right? Honestly, I'm a pretty simple guy. Don't have much trouble with anything. Is this taking long? I just... want to get this done.
DOCTOR: No, we’re almost done with the history part, Mr. Kingan. Just a few more questions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not even as a kid. Broke an arm once, I think, but it just healed on its own. Nothing serious. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Just wanna make sure this doesn’t take all day. I have practice later.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. And finally, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… That’s… tricky. My parents are both gone now. And I didn't really keep in touch with a lot of relatives. I know my dad had… heart problems, I think? But that was a long time ago. And my mom… I don’t really remember. Just… old age, I guess. Not much I can tell you, sorry. This is getting… I don’t know. Can we just… get to the physical exam part now? I’m not good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kingan. We can move on to the physical exam. It's alright that you don’t remember much about your family history. We'll do the best we can. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Just… please hurry, if you can. I really need to get back to practice. Thanks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, rate is approximately 72 beats per minute. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Now, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Relax your arm for me… Biceps reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Triceps reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender. No masses appreciated. Finally, I’ll just have you stand up and walk for me, if you would. I’m just checking your gait and coordination. Gait is steady, no significant abnormalities noted. Coordination appears intact. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So… am I cleared? I need to know if I can practice.
DOCTOR: Based on the physical exam, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be cleared to participate in archery practice. Your heart and lungs sound good, reflexes are normal, and your gait and coordination are intact. However, given your history of knee and back pain, I recommend taking it easy at first and gradually increasing your activity level. Be sure to warm up properly before practice and stretch afterward. And if you experience any significant pain, stop and rest. Would you like me to write a note for your coach stating that you are cleared for activity with these recommendations?
PATIENT: Yeah, that'd be great. A note is good. Thanks, Doctor. And… uh… how much do I owe you? Just wanna get this over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This note states that you’re cleared for archery practice, with the recommendations I mentioned. As for the cost… since you’re uninsured, the fee for the visit is $125. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Thanks again, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kingan. I’m glad I could help. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a good practice, and be careful! .
