DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh… well, it’s a bit… embarrassing, actually. It’s this pain… down there. I’m not quite sure why I’m having it, to be honest. It just… started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” you say. Right. Well, many things can cause pain in that region. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… yes. Um… it’s not… sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache, I suppose. And… it comes and goes? Sometimes it’s worse than others. It’s mostly… on one side, I think. Though, it’s hard to be certain. Everything just feels… uncomfortable. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: “Uncomfortable” is a start. Is it constant, or does something specifically trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think anything specific… walking doesn't seem to make it worse, and I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. Maybe… sitting for too long? But I do a lot of work, you know, with my hands… woodworking… so I'm often sitting. I honestly can’t pinpoint anything. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Woodworking, you say. Interesting. And, has this pain affected your… bowel movements or urination at all?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, now that’s a question. Let me see… I don't believe so? No, nothing different there, thankfully. Everything seems… normal, in that regard. I'm sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. This is all rather… unpleasant to talk about.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Alright. Let’s move on. Any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting associated with this pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and my stomach has been… well, as stable as it ever is. No vomiting or anything like that. I haven't felt generally unwell, just… this ache. It’s just… persistent, you know? It’s been enough to worry me, which isn’t something I usually do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… No, I don't think so. Not like this. I’ve had… aches and pains over the years, of course. Old age, you know? But nothing… specifically here. This is new. Completely new. And… a bit frightening, if I'm honest. I just want to know what it is and if it's something serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, to get a better understanding, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. A physical examination… yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle? It’s… a bit tender, as you might imagine.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as thorough and gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to start by palpating your abdomen, just to assess for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know immediately if you experience any significant pain.
PATIENT: Alright. Palpating… yes. I will, Doctor. I promise. Just… let me know what you’re doing as you go, if you wouldn’t mind? It’ll… help me relax.
DOCTOR: I'm starting in the upper abdomen, just to rule out anything obvious. I'm feeling for any tenderness, rigidity, or masses. And now, the lower abdomen. Can you tell me if this is painful?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That’s… uncomfortable. Not excruciating, but… definitely there. It’s a dull ache, like I said, but… it’s sharper when you press. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… definitely there. It's... sharper now. And... it radiates a little. Not a lot, but... it feels like it's spreading. I'm sorry. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on my examination, you have tenderness in your lower right quadrant with some radiation. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. Breathing normally… I haven't had anything… unusual to eat lately, have I? Or… done anything to upset my stomach? I'm trying to think of something that might explain this… I really can’t recall. Just… woodworking. And worrying, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Auscultation is normal. Now, Ms. Stepbro, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a urine analysis. We need to rule out infection. Given your symptoms and the tenderness I’ve noted, we also need to consider imaging – a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Are you able to undergo a CT scan?
PATIENT: Oh my. A CT scan… Imaging… that sounds… serious. Infection? A CT scan… Yes, I believe so. I have Medicare, so… I assume it’s covered? And yes, I can undergo a CT scan, I think. Though… what are we looking for, exactly? Is it something… very bad?
DOCTOR: A CT scan will allow us to visualize your abdomen and pelvis to determine the source of your pain. We're looking for signs of appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other potential causes. Given your age and symptoms, these are the most likely possibilities. As for Medicare coverage, yes, it should be covered, but you'll need to confirm with your insurance provider. I will have the nurse draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Then, we’ll schedule the CT scan. I understand this is concerning, Ms. Stepbro, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever in the meantime.
PATIENT: Oh… appendicitis… That doesn't sound good at all. Yes, the pain reliever would be very much appreciated. Thank you, Doctor. I will confirm with Medicare, as you suggested. I suppose… there’s no avoiding it, is there? I’ll do whatever you think is best. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, alright? Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate your patience.
