DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Obarr, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Norval Obarr. Pleased to meet ya, Dr. Sink, I think you said? Though I gotta say, these chairs aren’t the comfiest.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not dwell on the furniture, shall we?
PATIENT: Fair enough, fair enough. You got a busy clinic, I imagine. So, what can ya tell me about why I’m here? My wife, Elsie, she filled out a bunch of papers, but my memory ain’t what it used to be. Something about feelin' full too quick?
DOCTOR: Yes, according to the intake form, you’ve been experiencing early satiety—feeling full after only a small amount of food. And some weight loss. How long has this been going on, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Early… sati- what now? Elsie uses big words sometimes. Just… feelin’ full faster than I used to, and not eatin’ as much ‘cause of it. Hmm… let me think. It’s been… a few months, I reckon. Maybe since spring started? It’s hard to say exactly, things kinda blur together these days. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. Just don't have the appetite like I used to.
DOCTOR: A few months. Alright. And has anything changed with your…bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh. Well, now that you mention it… they haven’t been as regular. More…constipated, I guess you’d say. Elsie’s been makin’ me prune juice, bless her heart. Doesn’t seem to be doin’ much good, though. It’s not somethin’ I usually bother the doctor about, if ya catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Constipation. And any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. Never been much for throwin' up, thankfully. Just… full. And tired. That’s about it, really. It’s just… wearin’ me down, not bein’ able to enjoy a good meal like I used to. Elsie makes a wonderful salmon chowder, but I can barely get a bowl down these days. It’s a shame, it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any abdominal pain, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Maybe a little discomfort sometimes, kinda…bloated, after I do eat somethin’. But nothin’ sharp or nothin’. Just…full. Like I said, it's mostly just bein' full too quickly and feelin' tired all the time. It's not a nice way to live, I'll tell ya.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any change in its color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're askin’ things I don’t usually think about! Elsie's the one who checks all that stuff. Uh… no, I don't think so. Not that I've noticed. Everything seems pretty normal down there, if you know what I mean. I try not to look too closely, to be honest. It’s not a pleasant thought, lookin’ for…blood. Sorry, I'm rambling. It’s just… a bit much, all these questions.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your age and these symptoms… it could be a number of things. We need to rule out anything serious. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Then, I'm going to order some blood work, and possibly a stool test.
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doc. A physical exam… well, I’m not as nimble as I used to be, but I suppose I can manage. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones ain’t what they used to be either. And a stool test… Elsie will be happy to help with that part, I reckon. She's always been good at that sort of thing. Let's get it over with, then. The sooner we know, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just lie down on the table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll palpate it to check for any masses or tenderness. I’ll also check your reflexes. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here goes… It's been a while since I was poked and prodded like this. Just… try not to dig too deep, Doc. My insides are a bit sensitive these days. And Elsie always said I have a ticklish tummy. It's probably nothin', though. Just an old man's bones creakin'.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No significant tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. Bowel sounds are present, but diminished. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Diminished… what now? Sounds like I'm gettin' a bad report already. Elsie's gonna be worried. Just… try not to press too hard, alright? I get a bit short of breath sometimes. Old age, you know. And don't mind my creakin', it's just my bones talkin'. Go ahead, Doc. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright. Based on the limited exam, and your history… it could be a number of things. We need those blood tests to rule out anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and to check your liver function. The stool test will check for occult blood. I’ll write the orders now.
PATIENT: Occult…blood? That sounds serious, Doc. Elsie's gonna be real upset if it's blood. Is it…bad? And anemia… is that why I'm so tired all the time? I just wanna feel normal again, you know? It's hard gettin' old, Doc. Hard on the body, and hard on the mind. Just tell me straight, Doc. Is it somethin' really bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, it’s premature to jump to conclusions. Occult blood simply means blood that isn’t visible to the naked eye. It can be caused by many things, most of which are not life-threatening. And yes, anemia could explain your fatigue. But we need the test results before we can say anything definitively. I’m ordering the tests as a precaution. Let’s not borrow trouble. I'll have the nurse draw the blood, and I'll give you a container for the stool sample.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You're right, you're right. No need to borrow trouble. Just… it's hard not to worry, Doc. Elsie's always been the worrier in the family, but I reckon I'm startin' to pick up the habit. So, blood work and… a sample. Elsie can handle that part, no problem. Just tell me… how long 'til we get the results? A few days? A week? I just wanna know what we're dealin' with.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back in about five to seven business days. The nurse will contact you when they are available. In the meantime, try to maintain a healthy diet, and stay hydrated. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Five to seven days… alright. Elsie will be glad to know. And yeah, I guess that's all for now. Try to maintain a healthy diet… well, I try. But it's hard when you don't feel like eatin'. And severe pain… well, I'll be sure to let Elsie know. She's a good woman, that Elsie. Always lookin' out for me. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you takin' the time. I’ll see you in a week, then, if the results are back.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Obarr. .
