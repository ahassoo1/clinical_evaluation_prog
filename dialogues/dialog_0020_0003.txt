DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. My hand… it shakes. Been happening for a bit now. It’s annoying, that’s all. Honestly, I’ve seen doctors about it before, and they didn’t do much good. Just wanted to get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're experiencing a tremor in your hand, and you’ve seen other doctors about it previously. It’s frustrating when things aren't resolved quickly. We'll do our best to figure things out. When you say "a bit now," could you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Geez, lady, are you a detective or something? A few months, I guess. Maybe longer. Time all blends together when you get to be my age, you know? It wasn’t a sudden thing, it just… started. Not like I was writing a novel or something and suddenly couldn't hold the pen steady. It’s just… there. And it's getting worse, I suppose. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, I apologize – that wasn't meant to be an interrogation. Just trying to get a better timeline. A few months, gradually worsening… that’s helpful. And you mentioned it's not related to any specific activity, like writing?
PATIENT: No, not really. It happens when I'm just… sitting. Or holding a coffee cup. Or trying to tie my tie, which is a nightmare now, let me tell you. Honestly, I mostly wear sweaters these days. Easier. Don’t need a tie with a sweater, right? Look, I was a director, a producer, I didn't do things with my hands. I told people what to do with their hands. Big difference. This whole thing is just… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It sounds like it's impacting your daily life, and it's certainly understandable to feel that way. So, it’s present at rest, like when you’re sitting, and also when you're trying to do something precise, like with a coffee cup or tie?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Both. It's not like it's only when I'm stressed or something. Though, frankly, dealing with doctors is stressful enough. It’s just… there. And it’s getting harder to ignore. I used to be able to hide it, you know? Now, it’s… obvious. My grandkids asked about it last time. Kids always notice, don't they? Makes a fella feel… old. Can we just get this over with? I have a lunch reservation.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. We'll try to be as quick as possible. Before we do any examination, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What do you want to know? I’m eighty years old! What's to tell? I'm… old. I take some pills for my blood pressure, and my cholesterol. The usual. My wife… well, she passed away a few years back. And I mostly eat what I want. Not a saint, I’ll tell ya. I don’t smoke, haven’t in decades. And I certainly don't exercise. Is that enough? Honestly, I’m not a complicated case. Just a shaking hand. Can we focus on that? My doctor, Dr. Feldman, he used to come by the house, but he retired. Good man, Dr. Feldman. Knew his stuff. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Baide. That's very helpful. I'm sorry to hear about Dr. Feldman and your wife. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
