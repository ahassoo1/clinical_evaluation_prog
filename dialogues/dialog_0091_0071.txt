DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Thank you. Well, it’s a bit complicated, honestly. I’m helping a young woman… a friend of the family… with her paperwork for a visa. She needs to get some shots, I believe, and I told her I’d come with her to make sure she understands everything. I’m not quite sure which shots, or what’s required, and I thought it best to get it sorted out properly with a doctor. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. That's very considerate of you to assist her in this manner. It’s perfectly alright, and I’m happy to help clarify what vaccinations are needed for her visa application. To best advise you, could you tell me a bit more about where she is applying from and to?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. She’s originally from… let me think… Ukraine. And she’s applying to come to the United States, to live with her aunt in Ohio. It's a family visa, I believe, her aunt is a citizen. I’m afraid I don’t know all the details of the application itself, just that vaccinations are part of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Skarbek. Knowing the country of origin and the destination is very helpful. For visa applicants from Ukraine seeking residency in the United States, there are specific vaccination requirements mandated by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services . Generally, this includes verification of immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , and influenza, as well as an influenza vaccination if she is over six months of age. A tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine is also typically required, and a COVID-19 vaccine is now recommended. Do you happen to have any documentation regarding the specific vaccinations requested by USCIS, or have you spoken with the visa application service about precise requirements?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of vaccines. I hadn’t realized there were so many. No, I don’t have any paperwork from USCIS, and she’s handling most of the application details herself. She mentioned something about a form, I think, that lists what they need, but she hasn’t shown it to me yet. She’s a little overwhelmed, to be honest, and I offered to come along to help with the medical side of things. Would it be alright if we just… went through what she might need, and I could ask her when we get a chance? I don’t want to bother you with too many questions if it turns out she already has everything sorted.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek, that sounds perfectly reasonable. We can certainly discuss the standard requirements, and you can confirm with her what she has already completed. It’s quite common for applicants to be a bit overwhelmed with the process. Let’s start with her vaccination history, if you have any knowledge of it. Do you know if she has received any vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: That’s kind of you to say, Doctor. It's a relief to hear that's normal. To be honest… I don’t. She didn’t really talk about it much, and I didn't want to pry. Things were… difficult back home, for a long time. I imagine keeping track of vaccinations wasn’t a priority. She was quite young when she left, too. So, I’m afraid I don’t have any information about her past vaccinations. Would she need to have some kind of test to see if she has had them, then? I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Skarbek. Given the circumstances, it’s perfectly understandable that her vaccination records may not be available. There’s no need to apologize. In the absence of documentation, we can perform a blood test, called a titer test, to check for immunity to certain diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella. This will help us determine if she has existing immunity and doesn’t require vaccination for those specific diseases. We can also discuss the recommended vaccinations for adults, regardless of prior vaccination status, as a preventative measure. Would you like me to order a titer test for measles, mumps, and rubella?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If a test can tell us whether she’s already protected, that would be very helpful. Yes, please. A titer test sounds like a good idea. And… what about the other ones you mentioned? The tetanus and… the pertussis, was it? And the flu shot? Should we go ahead and schedule those as well, just in case? I want to make sure she’s covered, whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Skarbek. A thorough approach is always best. Yes, let’s include the Tdap vaccine—that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis—and an influenza vaccination. Even if she has had tetanus shots in the past, a booster is generally recommended every ten years, and the pertussis component is important to ensure protection against whooping cough. The influenza vaccine is recommended annually, especially as it changes each year. I will order the titer test, and we can administer the Tdap and influenza vaccines today, if she is agreeable. Before we proceed, are there any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Hmm… allergies. Let me think… She doesn’t seem to have any food allergies. I’ve never known her to have a reaction to anything. But… she mentioned once that she had a bad reaction to a penicillin-based antibiotic when she was a child. It gave her a rash, she said. It was a long time ago, though. Would that be important? I’m really not sure. She’s not one to complain, so it might not have been that serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Skarbek. It’s important to note any prior adverse reactions to medications, even if they occurred a long time ago. A history of a rash with a penicillin-based antibiotic does suggest a possible penicillin allergy. While not all rashes are allergic reactions, it's best to err on the side of caution. We will avoid prescribing any penicillin-based antibiotics in the future, and we will document this allergy in her medical record. For the vaccinations today, none of them contain penicillin. However, it’s important to inform the nurse about this history before administering the vaccines, just as a precaution. Do you have any other medical concerns I should be aware of, or is she generally in good health?
PATIENT: That’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking that seriously. She’s… generally quite healthy, I think. She works very hard, she’s a seamstress, so she’s on her feet a lot. No major illnesses, as far as I know. She’s had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. She does have a bit of trouble with her back sometimes, from all the sewing, but she doesn’t complain much. She’s a strong woman. And… she has a bit of high blood pressure, I think. Her aunt mentioned it when she was talking about the visa paperwork. She takes a pill for it, but I don’t know what kind. I’m afraid that’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Skarbek. Knowing about the high blood pressure is important. We will ask her to bring a list of her medications, if possible, so we can ensure there are no interactions with the vaccines. Let’s proceed with the vaccinations for now. We will document the history of high blood pressure and the penicillin allergy in her chart. I will also ask the nurse to monitor her blood pressure before and after administering the vaccines, just as a precaution. Before we begin, do you have any questions or concerns for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly, and I feel much more confident now. I think she’ll be relieved to have someone here to help sort things out. Just… making sure she doesn’t have a bad reaction is my main concern. But you seem very competent, so I’m trusting you to take good care of her. Thank you for your patience with me, and for answering all my questions. I really appreciate it. I suppose we should go ahead and get started, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we will take excellent care of her. We will monitor her closely throughout the process. If you’ll excuse me, I’ll have the nurse come in to begin the process. She will review the consent forms with her, check her vital signs, and administer the vaccinations. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. Nurse, could you please come to room three?
