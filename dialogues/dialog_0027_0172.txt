DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here. My husband, bless his heart, insisted. Something about… a social visit? I’ve just moved to the area, you see. And he worries. A great deal. Is this where one fills out forms? I haven’t the foggiest idea what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, forms are usually the first step. But don’t worry about that right now. It sounds like this is more of a general check-up, to get acquainted and make sure everything is alright since you’re new to the area. That's perfectly fine. We can certainly do that. Just… bear with me if I ask a few questions, even if they seem a little… repetitive. My memory isn’t what it used to be. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your health generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Heavens. That's a broad question. Well, I’ve lived a long life, I suppose. A very long life. I haven't been… unwell, not in any significant way. A few aches and pains, naturally. One expects that at my age. I try to stay active, though it’s becoming more difficult. Mostly just puttering about the garden, these days. And avoiding drafts. Drafts are terrible for the… for everything, really. Is that what you mean? Do you need specifics? I honestly can’t recall anything particularly noteworthy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. "Puttering about the garden" is good! And avoiding drafts is… wise. Let’s try this then. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness. Not that I’ve noticed. A little tired, perhaps. But who isn’t tired? It’s August, isn’t it? Terribly warm. I find myself napping more often. And my… my joints. They ache. But as I said, one expects that. Really, I feel quite… serviceable. Are you looking for something specific? I truly don't understand what you're trying to ascertain. This is rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: No, no, not tedious at all. Just trying to get a full picture. You mentioned tiredness and aching joints. Are the aches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go. Mostly go, thankfully. I wouldn't be gardening at all if they were constant. It’s… it’s a dull ache, really. Not sharp. More of a… a heaviness. And it’s usually worse in the mornings. After I’ve been sitting for a while. Honestly, I’m not a patient person. This is all so… roundabout. Are you a specialist in aches and pains? Because if not, I’m not sure this is a productive use of either of our time.
DOCTOR: I’m a family medicine doctor, Candice. So, I see a bit of everything. And yes, aches and pains are… common. Morning stiffness is often associated with arthritis, but it can be other things as well. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any swelling or redness in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling? Redness? I… I haven’t really looked, to be frank. I don’t spend a great deal of time scrutinizing my joints. I suppose I’d notice if it were terribly obvious. But no, not that I recall. I'm quite particular about my appearance, you see. I wouldn't let myself wander about with inflamed joints. Though, as I said, I haven’t actively been looking. This is becoming increasingly frustrating. Is there a point to all of this?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s difficult when things aren't clear. Let’s try a quick physical exam, if you're willing. Just a look at your joints, listen to your heart and lungs... standard things. It might give us a better idea of what’s going on, or rule things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Really. After all this questioning? I suppose… I suppose it can’t be helped. But please be gentle. My skin is rather delicate. And do hurry. I have a luncheon appointment. It’s with Mrs. Abernathy. She’s terribly judgmental, and I wouldn’t want to be late. Very well. Get on with it then. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. If you could just sit back and relax. I'll start with your heart and lungs, then we'll take a look at your joints. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Mild tenderness on the distal interphalangeal joints of both hands, but no significant swelling or redness observed. Range of motion is slightly limited in both knees, but within normal limits for age. No crepitus noted. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are intact.
PATIENT: Well? What did you discover? Is it something dreadful? Because frankly, I haven’t the energy for a serious illness. I simply haven't. And Mrs. Abernathy… well, she thrives on gossip. This is all very inconvenient. Get to the point, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. The good news is, everything seems generally… stable. Your heart and lungs sound good. The exam didn’t reveal anything alarming. It sounds like you may be experiencing some mild osteoarthritis, particularly in your hands and knees. That's common at your age and explains the aching and stiffness, especially in the mornings. It’s not dreadful, no. It’s manageable. We can discuss some options to help alleviate the discomfort.
PATIENT: Manageable? Oh, that's reassuring. So, what does "manageable" entail? More poking and prodding? Medications? I’m terribly sensitive to side effects, you see. And I’m not fond of pills. Honestly, Doctor, if it’s just a little aching, perhaps I’ll simply… endure it. It's probably nothing, really. Perhaps a warmer pair of gloves and a different chair. This is all rather… exhausting. Is there anything else? Because if not, I believe I should be going. Mrs. Abernathy is notoriously punctual. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. We could try some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're comfortable with that. And I would recommend some gentle exercises to maintain your range of motion. Physical therapy could be helpful as well, if you're interested. I can write a referral, if you like. If the pain worsens, or you develop any other symptoms, please don’t hesitate to come back. I understand your reluctance to take medication, and we can certainly focus on non-pharmacological approaches. I’ll make a note in your chart, and we can reassess at your next appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
