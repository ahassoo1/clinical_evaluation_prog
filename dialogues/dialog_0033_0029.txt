DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Obarr, is it?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. Norval Obarr. Though most folks just call me Norval. It's good to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. Though time is rather limited, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in today, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this…feeling full real quick. Like, I barely eat anything and I’m stuffed. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or two. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest. It’s just…annoying, mostly. And I worry a bit, you know? Not eating properly and all.
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes, I can appreciate that. A month or two…right. And has this fullness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really…well, sometimes I feel a little bit tired, but I’m eighty-eight years old! I figure some tiredness is just part of getting older, eh? I haven't lost any weight, and no pain or anything like that. Just…full too soon. It's just weird. I used to have a good appetite. My wife makes a lovely salmon chowder, but I can only manage a small bowl now.
DOCTOR: Right, tiredness…and no weight loss. And you said a change in appetite specifically related to solid foods?
PATIENT: Well, yeah, mostly. Liquids are okay. I still drink my tea just fine, and soup is alright in small portions. It’s the…bigger stuff. Meat, vegetables, that kind of thing. A little bit goes a long way now. I don’t want to make a fuss, but it's making it hard to enjoy my meals, and my wife worries about me. She's a good cook, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Everything goes down just fine. It's not like choking or anything. It just feels…like my stomach is full after only a few bites. Like there’s no room, even when there should be. It's hard to explain, I guess. It’s not painful, just…uncomfortable and frustrating. Do you think it could be something serious, Doctor? I get a little worried sometimes.
DOCTOR: We need to rule things out, of course. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting accompanying this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: No, not a bit. No sickness at all. Just full. And I haven’t changed anything in my diet, not really. Same things I’ve been eating for years. Salmon, halibut, some berries when they're in season… My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but… well, you know how it is. I try, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick listen and feel. Just relax, Mr. Obarr. No obvious masses or tenderness. Abdomen is soft. Normal bowel sounds. Still, this could be a number of things. Let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it was just age. They gave me some pills for a while, but I haven’t been on anything for a good five years now. Other than that… not much. Just the usual aches and pains that come with being old! I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. My wife always said I was a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Right, appendectomy and some previous cardiac issues. Any family history of…gastrointestinal problems, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother…she had trouble with indigestion, always complaining about heartburn. And my brother, he had an ulcer when he was younger, but he smoked too much, if you ask me. Nothing serious, though. Nothing like cancer or anything, thank goodness. We’re a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. Lots of fishermen in the family, you know. Tough folks. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age and the lack of any alarming symptoms like weight loss or bleeding, it's unlikely to be something immediately concerning. However, to be thorough, I’d like to order some basic bloodwork. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, and some liver function tests. And perhaps a fecal occult blood test, just to rule things out. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with any pills before, like I said. Bloodwork sounds fine, whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. As long as it helps figure out what's going on, I'm happy to go along with it. My wife will be relieved to hear we’re doing something, she worries so much. She'll probably want to know all the results, too. She's a very… thorough woman.
DOCTOR: Right. I’ll get the order sent to the lab. You can go there at your convenience. It will require a small blood sample. I'll also write a note for your wife outlining what we discussed and what we’re checking for. In the meantime, try eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoid lying down immediately after eating. If the fullness becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Smaller meals, don’t lie down… I can manage that. And I’ll let you know right away if anything changes. Thank you for listening, Doctor. It’s good to know someone is taking a look at this. I appreciate your time. Now, about this lab… is it far from here? My wife usually drives me, and I don’t want to give her a long trip if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: It’s about a fifteen-minute drive, just off of Main Street. The address and phone number are on the requisition. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your next appointment. We'll review the results as soon as they're available. Alright, well, I believe that concludes our consultation for today. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Obarr.
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. Fifteen minutes is no trouble at all. And thank you both for your help. I'll be sure to call if anything changes. You have a good day, Doctor.
