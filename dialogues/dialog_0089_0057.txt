DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you about it. I don’t really know much about what happens next, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's… a lot to take in, I understand. “About the cancer” is pretty broad, and it’s perfectly normal to feel unsure when you’re first facing this. Let’s start with the basics. Do you know where the cancer is located, and what type it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… the doctor who told me about it… he said it was in my lung. And… something about small cells? I really wasn’t listening very well, I’m afraid. It was all a bit of a shock, and I was mostly just trying to remember what he wasn’t saying, about… about my husband. He passed a few months back, and… well, I suppose my mind wasn’t fully present.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Losing your husband so recently... that's a huge loss, and it's entirely understandable if you weren't fully able to focus during that appointment. It’s okay, that’s what I’m here for. So, small cell lung cancer. That narrows things down. Do you happen to know what stage it was diagnosed at?
PATIENT: Stage…? Oh dear. No, I don’t believe he said anything about a stage. He just said… tests showed something, and it was cancer. And that I needed to see someone who could help. I’m very sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is important, yes, but don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. Staging helps us understand how far the cancer has spread, which guides our treatment decisions. We'll figure it out, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that makes sense, I suppose. It’s just… everything feels very overwhelming. I don't even know what sort of questions I should be asking. And I… I worry about the cost. I have Medicare, but… will it cover everything?
DOCTOR: Those are all incredibly valid concerns, Chellsea. It is overwhelming, and it’s good you're thinking about the practical side of things too. Let’s tackle things one step at a time. First, let’s get a clearer picture of the cancer itself. I'd like to review any imaging or pathology reports from your previous doctor. Do you have those with you today, or would you prefer I request them directly?
PATIENT: I… I don't think I do. He just told me to come here. I didn’t really do anything else. I suppose you could request them? I wouldn't even know where to begin looking for them. I just… I just followed his instructions. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely alright, Chellsea. That’s perfectly fine. I will request those records right away. It may take a few days to receive them, but we can start with a general exam and discuss some of your medical history in the meantime. Now, while I wait for those records to start coming through, can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Alright. Um… I try to eat healthy, mostly. I don't smoke, never have. I used to be very active, hiking a lot with my husband… but since he passed, I haven’t been doing much of anything, really. I do have a bit of trouble with my breathing sometimes, even before all this… I just thought it was… getting older. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Knowing about your activity level and any pre-existing breathing issues is important. You mentioned some breathing trouble even before the cancer diagnosis. Can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s just a bit of shortness of breath. Mostly when I exert myself. Like… walking up hills. Or even just climbing the stairs. It’s not… terrible. Just… noticeable. And it’s been getting a little worse over the last year or so. I haven’t really bothered a doctor about it. I just thought it was a natural part of aging. I didn't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s definitely worth looking into, even if you thought it was just aging. Shortness of breath can have many causes, and we want to be thorough. Now, have you had any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I’ve been… very tired, I suppose. But that could just be… everything. Grief, and worrying, and… not sleeping very well. I haven't really felt much pain, if that's what you mean. No coughing, no… nothing like that. Just tired. And… a little lost, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Grief and worry can be incredibly exhausting. Okay, good to know about the lack of pain, cough, or other noticeable symptoms. Now, I’m going to ask some routine questions, just to get a complete picture of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox… but nothing serious. I had a surgery when I was a teenager, to remove my appendix, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise… I've always been fairly healthy. Until… this. And my husband, of course. He had some heart trouble, towards the end.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager, and your husband's heart trouble. I'm sorry to hear about that. Let's continue with your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes. And my father’s brother… he had lung cancer, but he was a heavy smoker. He passed away many years ago. Otherwise… I don’t really know much about my family history. My parents aren't around anymore, and we weren’t very close. Does that… help? I feel like I’m not being very useful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chellsea. It's common to not have a complete family history. Knowing about the diabetes and your uncle's lung cancer is helpful, even if the details are limited. Now, let's talk about social history. Do you drink alcohol, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have. And I don't use any drugs, either. I’ve always… preferred a quiet life. I used to enjoy gardening with my husband, that was my enjoyment. Now… well. Just trying to get through each day, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. And I'm very sorry about your husband again. It sounds like you shared a lovely life with him. Are you currently taking any medications, Chellsea?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, for aches and pains. But nothing regular. And a multivitamin, I suppose, but I’ve been forgetting to take it lately. That’s about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very fortunate, in that regard. No allergies. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had a reaction to any medications. That’s one less thing to worry about, I suppose. Is that… all the questions? I feel a bit like I’m being interrogated. Not that I’m unhappy to answer, it's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: You're not being interrogated, Chellsea, I promise. I just need to gather as much information as possible to provide the best care for you. And no, that’s the last of the routine questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate, and feeling for any abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Whatever you need to do. I just… I don't like hospitals. Or doctors, really. But I understand you're trying to help. I suppose I should cooperate. Just… please be gentle. And try not to take too long. I get… anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. I’ll be as gentle and as quick as possible. And please, let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point during the exam. Okay, let’s start by listening to your lungs. I'm going to ask you to take a few deep breaths while I listen to your back and chest. Okay. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. I'll also listen to your heart now. Your heart rate is regular, but a bit fast. I don't hear any murmurs. Now, I'm just going to feel your lymph nodes to check for any swelling. Your lymph nodes feel normal, no swelling detected. Alright, that concludes the physical exam for now. It was brief, but it gives me a starting point. I’ll need to review your previous imaging and pathology reports to get a more complete picture.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, that wasn’t too bad, I suppose. Did you… find anything? Is it as bad as I fear? I know you haven’t seen the reports yet, but… even a little reassurance would be nice. I feel very lost, and very scared. And… very tired.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, I understand your fear and anxiety. It’s perfectly natural to feel lost and scared in a situation like this. And yes, it's good you're tired, it's okay to feel that way. At this point, I haven't seen the reports, so I can't give you a definitive answer. However, the diminished breath sounds I heard are concerning, and it's good that we're investigating this further. The fast heart rate could be related to the anxiety, or it could be a sign of something else. I don't want to jump to conclusions without seeing the reports, but we need to take this seriously. I will request those records immediately. While we're waiting, I want to discuss the next steps. We may need to order additional imaging, such as a CT scan or MRI, to get a clearer picture of the cancer. We'll also likely need a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of cancer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Additional imaging… and a biopsy. That sounds… frightening. But I suppose it's necessary. Whatever you think is best. I just want… I just want to know what I'm facing. And… what my options are. Is there… is there anything I can do to prepare? For the tests, I mean. And… is there a chance… is there a chance it's not as bad as it seems? I know you haven’t seen the reports, but… a little hope would be nice. Even a tiny bit.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, it’s absolutely okay to be frightened. And it’s good that you're asking these questions. Let’s address them one by one. Regarding the tests, for the CT scan or MRI, you don’t need to do much preparation. You’ll likely be asked to remove any jewelry or metal objects, and you may receive a contrast dye to improve the images. The biopsy will involve taking a small sample of tissue for examination. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but we'll do everything we can to minimize your discomfort. And yes, there is a chance it's not as bad as it seems. It’s possible the initial diagnosis was incorrect, or that the cancer is less aggressive than we fear. We won’t know until we see the reports and perform the additional tests. I promise to keep you informed every step of the way, and to answer any questions you have. We’ll take this one step at a time, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time. I can do that. I think. Thank you, Doctor. For… for being patient with me. And for not… for not dismissing my fears. It means a lot. Is there anything I should be doing right now? Besides waiting for the reports, I mean. Should I be resting? Eating a certain diet? Trying to… stay positive? I know that sounds silly. But I want to do whatever I can to help. Even if it’s just… hoping for the best.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It’s my job to be patient and understanding. And you’re not silly at all for asking that. Right now, the best thing you can do is focus on taking care of yourself. Get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and try to manage your stress levels. There’s no special diet that will cure cancer, but eating well can help your body cope with the treatment. And yes, staying positive is important, but it’s also okay to feel sad, angry, or scared. Don’t bottle up your emotions. I also recommend reaching out to your support network—friends, family, or a support group—for help. You don’t have to go through this alone. I will call as soon as I receive the reports, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Do you have any questions for me right now, before I let you go?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You’ve answered everything. I think I just need to… process everything. And wait for the reports. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. For everything. I appreciate your kindness. And your patience.
