DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. It’s about this…procedure. My daughter booked it, honestly. Says I need to look…fresher. Something about getting cleared for surgery. Terrazzo work isn't easy on a man, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. A “fresher” look for surgery preparation. Well, we all want to present our best selves. Terrazzo work is demanding, I suppose. Your daughter mentioned surgery…do you know what type of surgery you’re scheduled for, and when?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. She handles all these things. Face lift, I think? Something like that. August 15th, she said. Doesn’t matter to me. Just want it over with. Don't see why I need a doctor's permission to get a little work done.
DOCTOR: Right. A facelift on August 15th. It does often require medical clearance, especially at your age, Mr. Orwin, to ensure you're healthy enough for anesthesia and the procedure itself. We need to make sure there aren’t any underlying conditions that would pose a risk. Let’s start with a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any significant illnesses – heart problems, diabetes, lung issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Lung issues? Goodness, no. I've worked outdoors my whole life. Strong lungs. Heart's a little…fluttery sometimes, but it's old age. My wife, God rest her soul, she had the high blood pressure. Not me. Otherwise, I’m as sound as a…well, as sound as a well-laid terrazzo floor.
DOCTOR: “Fluttery” heart… that's a bit vague, Mr. Orwin. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart condition – arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Doctors these days… always wanting a label for everything. It just… skips a beat now and then. Stress, probably. My daughter worries too much. Besides, I’ve always been a bit…sensitive. Doesn’t mean I'm ill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I avoid them whenever possible. Gave me a rash once, years ago. Some sort of penicillin, I think. It was…unpleasant. I don’t like the way they make you feel. Best to just tough things out, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter things like aspirin, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little fish oil. For my joints, you know. Helps with the aches. And sometimes, when my daughter's fussing, I’ll take a little something to help me sleep. Just a half a tablet. She brings it. Don't even know what it's called.
DOCTOR: Right. Fish oil and…something for sleep. We really need to know what that sleep medication is, Mr. Orwin, for safety reasons. Do you happen to know the name, or perhaps your daughter could provide it?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't the slightest. She gets it from the pharmacy. Little white pill. That’s all I know. She means well, but she’s…detailed. Overly detailed. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I lay floors. I don’t need to know the chemical composition of everything I swallow.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll need to find out what that pill is. For now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart and lungs, blood pressure, the usual. Then we can discuss getting you cleared for this surgery. If you could just have a seat here, please.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Don't poke around too much, though. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure. 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let's listen to your heart. I do hear a slight irregularity. It’s not strong, but it’s there. And your lungs sound clear, good and strong as you said. Now, I'm going to listen to your back. Everything sounds normal here. Now, I'm going to check your pulse... A little fast, but not alarmingly so. I also want to quickly check your reflexes. They're a little diminished, but not unexpected for your age. Overall, you seem relatively healthy, but that heart irregularity and the elevated blood pressure are concerns. I want to order an EKG and some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: EKG? Blood work? Honestly. All this fuss for a little face lift. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness, but I haven't got time for a whole battery of tests. Can't we just…skip it? My daughter will have a fit if I don't get this done.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, this isn't just about a "little face lift." You are scheduled for surgery, which involves anesthesia, and that carries risks. We need to ensure your heart is stable enough to handle it. Skipping these tests isn’t an option, not responsibly. It’s about your safety. An EKG will show us if there are any hidden heart problems, and the blood work will tell us about your overall health and if there’s anything that might complicate the procedure. I understand your daughter is eager to get this done, but her wishes aren't more important than your well-being. I'm going to order these tests. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss whether or not you are a suitable candidate for surgery. I can have my staff draw the blood now, and we’ll schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning. Does that work?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do what you have to do. But if this makes me late for my dominoes game, I'm holding you responsible. Get it over with. Just… don't expect me to be happy about it. And tell that daughter of mine to stop worrying so much! Just get the blood drawn.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll also have them schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning. Please try to relax, Mr. Orwin. This is standard procedure, and it's all in the interest of ensuring a safe and successful surgery. And perhaps, if you are feeling up to it, you could ask your daughter to bring the name of that sleep medication to your next appointment. It would be most helpful. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
