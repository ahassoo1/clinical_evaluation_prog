DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? My husband and me, we want to go live there. They need… paper from doctor, yes? To say I am okay to go.
DOCTOR: A… a residency, you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Residency. That is it. My husband, he finds it on the computer. A nice place, they say. But they need… check from doctor first. Is good, yes? To make sure I am… healthy enough?
DOCTOR: Healthy enough, yes, quite. It’s… prudent. Very prudent. Well, let’s get this “check,” as you call it, done then. To clarify, Ms. Abdollahi, are you experiencing any current health problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really problems. Old bones, you know? Sometimes… a little ache here and there. Nothing big. And I get… tired easy. But who doesn't at my age, yes? I eat good food, I sleep… okay. Nothing make me worry.
DOCTOR: “Subjective complaints of fatigue and generalized aches.” Right. And are you currently taking any medications for these aches, or for anything else at all?
PATIENT: Just… a little pill for my water. The water make my feet… puffy sometimes. My friend told me about it. I think it’s… diuretic? Is that right? For take water away. And sometimes, when I cannot sleep, I take… something my daughter give me. But not every night.
DOCTOR: A diuretic, yes. And what is the name of this… pill for your water?
PATIENT: Oh… I don't know the name. Small white pill. It come in… plastic bottle. My friend, she give me. She get it from… the store, I think? Not doctor. Just the store. I forgot what she call it. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Abdollahi, it’s… not ideal to take medication without knowing what it is or discussing it with a physician. We’ll need to address that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Never have allergy. Maybe a little dust sometimes, but nothing… serious. I eat everything. Fish, chicken, beans… everything. Never have trouble with food. Never.
DOCTOR: Very good. And have you been admitted to the hospital before for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Long time ago… maybe when I was little girl. I fall from the tree. Broke my arm, I think. But that was… so long ago. Not adult time. Since then… no hospital. Just the doctor for checkups. And sometimes… when I get a cold.
DOCTOR: Right, a childhood injury. And your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… my mama… she have… problems with her sugar. The sweet thing, yes? Diabetes, I think my daughter call it. And my papa… he have… heart trouble. Always tired. But he live long time, he is… 90 years when he die. My sister… she have… nothing much. She is healthy, thank God.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and heart problems. Noted. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. I want to go to the nice place! Just… be gentle, okay? My bones… they are old.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. We’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85… slightly elevated. Heart sounds… regular, but a bit distant. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. What is… auscul… that word? Is that bad? My husband, he always say I forget things. I worry about my memory. Is that something… you can check? For my brain?
DOCTOR: Auscultation simply means listening with a stethoscope. It’s a routine part of the examination. As for your memory… well, some cognitive decline is common with age. We can perform a brief screening test, but it’s hardly definitive. Right now, we need to focus on your overall health to determine if you are fit for residency. Now, can you tell me if you have any difficulty with walking or balance?
PATIENT: No… not really. Sometimes… a little wobbly when I stand up fast. But nothing big. I still walk every day. To the store, to see my friend. I still cook, still clean… still do everything. I just… slow, maybe. My husband, he say I take longer to do things. But I still do them!
DOCTOR: Reports occasional lightheadedness upon standing. Alright. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. Some mild edema present in both lower extremities. Pitting edema, 1+ bilaterally. And you mentioned taking a pill for the swelling?
PATIENT: Yes, the white one. My friend Rosa give it to me. She say it help her feet, too. She get it from… the little store on the corner. I don’t know what it is, Doctor. I try to ask her, but she forget! She is old like me. It help a little, but… not much. My feet still puffy at the end of the day. Is it bad to take this pill, Doctor? Should I stop?
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, it is highly inadvisable to take medication without a proper diagnosis and prescription. We have no idea what this pill contains, what interactions it may have, or what potential side effects it could cause. I strongly recommend you discontinue its use immediately. To proceed with this assessment, I will need to order some blood work to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and electrolytes. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you consent to this?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. If you think it’s important. Blood work, yes. Whatever you need. I want to go to the nice place, Doctor. And I don’t want to make anything worse. So… yes. Please. Just… tell me where I go for this work. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard blood draw. There will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The lab is located just across the hall, room 203. They will take a few vials of blood. The results should be back within 48 hours. I will review them and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please discontinue the medication you are taking for your feet. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Understood. No more white pill. I go to room 203. No hurt. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I hope the results are good. I really want to go to the nice place.
DOCTOR: Very well. A staff member will escort you to the lab. I will be in touch.
