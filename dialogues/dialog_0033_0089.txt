DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s quite severe. I believe that’s what prompted the appointment. It's been happening… for a bit now, I suppose. Honestly, keeping track of time is becoming more difficult these days.
DOCTOR: "A bit" is… not terribly helpful, Ms. Glymph. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You're quite right. My apologies. Let me think… It started, I believe, sometime after the… the heatwave, perhaps? Yes, that feels right. So, June, maybe? Or was it July? It's all a bit of a blur, truthfully. It hasn't been constant, thankfully. Just these… episodes. And they seem to be getting a little more frequent.
DOCTOR: Right. June or July. And these "episodes"—can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a deep ache, a cramping sensation. It feels… like everything is tightening up inside. And it spreads, you see. Starts low, but then it radiates up into my back sometimes. It makes it difficult to… well, to do anything, really. Just want to lie down and be still. It’s quite unpleasant. Do you… understand? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Radiating pain is… common. Has anything specific triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggered… that’s a good question. I haven’t noticed anything specific, no. I try to be mindful of what I eat, but… honestly, I can’t say I’ve identified a pattern. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been walking, sometimes when I’m resting. It seems quite random, really. I did have a rather strenuous day in the garden a few weeks ago—weeding, mostly—but that was some time before the episodes started becoming more frequent. Could that be related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Possibly. We'll need to rule out more serious issues first. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Oh dear. That's… a rather personal question, isn't it? Well, yes, actually. I have been… a bit more irregular, I suppose. Not terribly concerning, but… different. More frequent trips, and… not as solid as usual, if you understand. I thought it might just be something I ate, but it’s been going on for a while now. I hadn’t connected it to the pain, though. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's relevant. Any nausea, vomiting, or fever accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no nausea or vomiting. And no fever that I’m aware of. I do feel… rather tired, generally, but that’s been the case for some time now. I attributed that to… well, to getting older, mostly. I do seem to tire rather easily these days. I haven’t felt sick, if that makes sense. Just… uncomfortable and tired. Is this all going on the record, Doctor? I do hope it isn't too much bother.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s all documented. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, there’s… the lupus, of course. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That’s what the rheumatologist told me, years ago. It flares up from time to time. And… I believe I have some arthritis as well, in my hands and knees. It’s not terribly debilitating, but it’s there. I see Dr. Alistair for that, periodically. Does that… is that what you meant? Are you familiar with lupus, Doctor? It seems to affect things in… unpredictable ways, sometimes. That’s why I'm always a bit anxious when something new arises. It's hard to know what's lupus-related and what isn't.
DOCTOR: Lupus… right. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, a very long time ago. And… I was hospitalized briefly a few years back, during a particularly bad lupus flare. I was quite weak, and they had to give me some… infusions, I believe. I don't recall the details very well. It was a blur. Nothing major, though. Nothing recently. And… I've had numerous doctor's appointments, naturally, due to the lupus. But nothing that required… a long stay in the hospital. I hope that’s helpful. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm beginning to feel a bit… flustered, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That's a difficult one. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was quite young. I don't recall much about his medical history, truthfully. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. He lives quite far away, so we don't see each other often. I don’t believe there’s a history of anything… serious, like cancer or anything, in either family. Mostly just… the usual things, I suppose. Arthritis, heart trouble… nothing too alarming. Is that… sufficient? I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’m allergic to penicillin. Quite severely, actually. I get a rash, and… well, it’s not pleasant. I always make sure to tell any doctor before they prescribe anything. And… I think I’m a bit sensitive to sulfa drugs, but it’s not a full-blown allergy, more of an… upset stomach. That’s all, I believe. No other allergies that I’m aware of. Just the penicillin, and the slight sensitivity to sulfa. Is there anything else, Doctor? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded. Perhaps I should have had something to eat before coming.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take Plaquenil, for the lupus, every day. And… I take a low dose of methotrexate, also for the lupus, once a week. And… I take ibuprofen, as needed, for the arthritis. Sometimes I take Tylenol, as well, if the ibuprofen isn't enough. And… I take a vitamin D supplement, because my levels were low, according to my last blood test. Oh, and… a multivitamin, just to be safe. That's all, I think. I take them regularly, as prescribed. I have a list at home, if you need the exact dosages. I just… don’t recall them off the top of my head. Is that sufficient, Doctor? I apologize for my rambling. I do tend to get a bit… flustered when I’m asked about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Lie back on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and palpate it. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Palpate… is that pressing on my stomach? Yes, alright. I’ll try to relax. It’s… sometimes difficult, you see. But I’ll do my best. Please let me know if it’s… uncomfortable. I do bruise easily, so be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in the lower quadrants, particularly on the left side. Some guarding, but no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are… present, but slightly diminished. No palpable masses. Lymph nodes are… normal size. Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That… is a bit tender, on the left side. As you said. It’s not excruciating, but… definitely noticeable. I do feel a bit… bloated, if that makes sense. Like there’s pressure inside. My heart… is that alright? It sometimes… flutters, you know. But I haven’t mentioned it to anyone, because it’s usually just temporary. Please let me know if you hear anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Alright. Given your history of Lupus and these findings, we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, inflammatory markers, and a comprehensive stool analysis. We'll also need a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… is that… is that serious? And blood work… so many tests. What… what are you looking for, exactly? Is it something… bad? I do get anxious about these things, you see. I always worry that it’s something… irreparable. The lupus… is it flaring up again? Is that what you think? Please, Doctor, tell me what’s going on. I prefer to know the worst, even if it’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Glymph. We need to rule out several possibilities—diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and to assess the extent of any Lupus-related inflammation. The CT scan will give us a clearer picture of your abdominal organs. The blood work will help us identify any signs of infection or inflammation. I’m not going to speculate without the results. It could be nothing, but we need to be thorough. I will have the lab requisition and CT order sent to the front desk. You can schedule the CT scan at your convenience. I recommend scheduling it as soon as possible. We'll review the results in a week. If your pain worsens significantly before then, go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Diverticulitis… inflammatory bowel disease… Oh dear. Those sound… frightening. A week… a whole week of worrying. Is there… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Any medication, any diet changes… anything to alleviate the pain? I do find it difficult to… to cope with discomfort, you see. And… what if it is something serious? What… what are the treatment options? I understand you don’t want to speculate, but… a little reassurance would be… helpful. Is there a nurse I could speak with, perhaps? Someone who can explain things a little more… gently? I feel… quite overwhelmed. .
DOCTOR: You can continue taking ibuprofen as needed for pain. Avoid foods that typically trigger digestive upset—caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods. I’ll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment in one week. The nurse is busy with other patients. I’ve explained the situation as thoroughly as possible. I suggest you try to remain calm and focus on managing your pain. That's all for today, Ms. Glymph. You’re free to go. .
