DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I am Dr. Eaddy. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well, it’s… about the team. The baseball team. I’m trying out. Need a check-up for that, I guess. They said I needed one. A physical, they called it.
DOCTOR: A sports physical. Right. While I appreciate your… enthusiasm, Mr. Bartok, a comprehensive medical evaluation is always prudent before undertaking any strenuous activity. Especially at your age. Now, let’s begin with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems – that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Hmm. I don’t think so. My ex-wife… she always said I was stubborn as a mule, but I don’t know if that’s a condition. Blood pressure… maybe a little high sometimes when she was yelling? But nothing a good nap couldn't fix. No, I don't think I have any of those things you said.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! There was that time I fell off the roof… fixing the gutter. But I didn’t go to the hospital. Old Man Hemandez patched me up. He’s good with a needle and thread, that one. Doesn't count as a surgery, does it? It didn’t feel like a surgery. Just a lot of bandages.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate Mr. Hemandez’s… skills, a thorough medical evaluation requires documentation from a qualified healthcare professional. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother, she… well, she liked to worry a lot. Always saying someone had the "bad air." But I never knew what they had. Mostly it was just gossip, if you ask me. My father, he worked construction, strong as an ox. Never sick a day in his life, 'til the very end. So, no, not that I recall. Mostly just… strong people who didn't complain much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh! I take these little white pills sometimes. For my knee. It bothers me when it rains. Old man Hemandez gave those to me too. Says it’s for the… the swelling. I don’t know what they are, exactly. Just white pills.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you allergic to any medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Bees, I think. I got stung once when I was a kid. Swelled up like a balloon, my mother said. But that was a long time ago. Never had any trouble with… anything else. No, I don't think so. Nothing I know of. Unless you count my ex-wife’s cooking… that gave me heartburn something awful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Bartok, to proceed, I will need to conduct a brief physical examination. This will include listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and assessing your range of motion. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical examination, huh? Sounds alright. As long as you don't make me run. My knee, you know. Not what it used to be. But I can sit still. And I don't mind if you listen. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, have a seat. We will take things slowly. Now, if you would please remove your shirt and lie back. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply, please. Heart rate is slightly elevated, but rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 142/90. A bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, let’s check your knee. Could you please bend it for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. Ooh, that's not so good. Feels a little stiff. Like there's sand in there. See? It pops when I bend it too.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do feel some swelling and hear some crepitus with movement. Range of motion is limited, and you report pain with flexion. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and muscle strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups. Given your history and the findings of this examination, it appears you may have some early signs of osteoarthritis in your knee. It’s not severe at this time, but it is something we need to monitor. Do you experience pain with walking or standing for prolonged periods?
PATIENT: Osteo-what-now? Sounds… serious. You mean I shouldn't be playing baseball? Pain with walking… sometimes. Not all the time. But if I walk too far, or stand for too long, it starts to ache. Especially if it’s cold. That’s why I take those white pills. They help a little. But not always.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition, meaning the cartilage in your knee is wearing down over time. It’s a common condition, particularly as we age. It doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t play baseball, but it does mean we need to be cautious and manage the condition appropriately to prevent further damage. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I recommend the following. First, I’d like to order some X-rays of your knee to get a better look at the joint space and assess the extent of the cartilage loss. Second, I suggest you start a course of physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion. Third, we can discuss over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help manage your pain. Finally, it's important to avoid activities that exacerbate your pain. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: X-rays… physical therapy… that sounds like a lot. And expensive. Over-the-counter… like what you buy at the drugstore? Will this mean I can’t try out for the team? I’ve been practicing hard, you know. This is important to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, over-the-counter, as you said, available at the drugstore. They can be quite effective in managing pain and inflammation. Regarding the tryouts… I'm not saying you cannot try out, Mr. Bartok. However, I strongly advise against participating in any strenuous activity until we have the results of the X-rays and you’ve had a consultation with a physical therapist. We need to assess the stability of your knee and ensure you don’t risk further injury. Pushing yourself too hard at this stage could lead to more significant damage, potentially requiring more invasive interventions down the line. My priority is to ensure your long-term health and well-being, even if that means temporarily delaying your tryouts. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So… no baseball for now. That’s what you’re saying. Even practicing? I understand… I guess. It just… it’s been a long time since I’ve had something to look forward to. But… alright. X-rays and physical therapy. Can you… write down the name of the place for the X-rays? And the physical therapy? I’m not good with remembering things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is a referral for X-rays at Rural Imaging, located on Main Street. They accept Medicare, as I’ve indicated on the form. And this is a referral to Premier Physical Therapy, also on Main Street. They specialize in sports-related injuries and will develop a customized treatment plan for you. I also recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks, after you’ve had the X-rays and started physical therapy, so we can discuss the results and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, avoid any activities that exacerbate your knee pain. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Two weeks, you said? I’ll try to remember. Alright then. I guess I’ll see you in two weeks. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bartok. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you then. Please call the office to schedule your appointment. . .
