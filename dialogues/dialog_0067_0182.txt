DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, the whole thing is a bother, really. I need a signature, a piece of paper that says I’m fit enough. For… a little touch-up. Don’t see why I need to visit a doctor for it, but my boy said it was necessary. Something about insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you need a medical clearance form completed for a procedure. And your son thought it would be best to have a doctor examine you first, which is very responsible of him. Just to be clear, is this a cosmetic procedure, or is there another medical reason for it?
PATIENT: Cosmetic, of course. Do I look like I’m falling apart? It's just… a bit of sagging. A man wants to keep up appearances, doesn’t he? It’s hardly a life-threatening condition requiring a full examination. Honestly, the questions… wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Mr. Orwin. While it's true a cosmetic procedure isn't usually a medical emergency, even with elective procedures, it’s my responsibility to ensure you're a suitable candidate and to understand any potential risks. It helps protect your well-being. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Fine. Perfectly fine. I’ve lived eighty-one years, haven’t I? Worked hard my whole life. Terrazzo. It keeps a man fit, all that bending and polishing. No major problems. A few aches and pains, what do you expect? But nothing that would stop me from… well, you know. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand you’re generally healthy and active. Just to get a more complete picture, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems – at any point in your life?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never had anything “diagnosed.” I’ve had the occasional cold, a bit of the flu now and then. Old age comes with a sniffle or two, you know. I don’t go running to the doctor every time I feel a bit under the weather. My wife – bless her soul – she was the one who always worried about such things. But no, nothing diagnosed. Are we nearly finished with this? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. Years ago… when I was a young man, maybe forty? I fell off a scaffolding. Broke my wrist. Had it set, of course. A few days in the hospital. Nothing serious. And… that’s it. Really. Nothing else. It was a long time ago. This is getting rather tedious, don’t you think? Just sign the paper and let me get on with my day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What do you want to know about my family? My son, as I said. He’s fine. A bit overbearing, always fussing. And my wife… well, she passed away five years ago. A good woman. What relevance does any of this have to a little… procedure? I fail to see the connection.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. I ask about family history because certain medical conditions can run in families, which can sometimes be relevant even for elective procedures. For example, do you know if anyone in your family has had problems with blood clotting, or heart conditions?
PATIENT: Blood clotting? Heart conditions? Honestly! My mother lived to be ninety. My father, eighty-five. They were strong, healthy people. Norwegian stock, you know. We don't have heart conditions. We build things! We don’t lie around waiting for our hearts to give out. This is a complete waste of my time. I’m telling you, I’m perfectly healthy. Sign the paper. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. I appreciate you sharing that. Just a few more quick questions, then I can do a brief physical exam, and hopefully, we can get this form completed for you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had an allergy in my life. I can take anything. Strong stomach, you see. Always ate whatever my wife put in front of me, and she was a good cook. No allergies. Honestly, are we going to do this or not? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. Sometimes I take a little something for my joints, when they’re acting up. Just an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think. And sometimes a multivitamin. That's it. Nothing regular. Just when I need it. Now, can we please get this over with? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded just from all these questions.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ibuprofen as needed for your joints and a multivitamin. That’s helpful. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam just to make sure everything is okay. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't take too long. And be gentle, my joints aren’t what they used to be. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just relax. I’ll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s take a look at your joints. Can you bend your elbows and knees for me?
PATIENT: Ouch! There we go. See? That's what I mean. A little stiff, a little creaky. Eighty-one years of hard work will do that to a man. Don’t go poking around too much. Are we getting closer to this piece of paper or not? I really must be going soon. Lunch won’t wait forever.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see a little stiffness and crepitus in your joints, which is common for someone your age. No significant swelling or redness. And your reflexes are normal. Now, before I complete this form, I want to address your blood pressure. It’s slightly elevated, and while it may not be directly related to the procedure, it’s something we should monitor. I recommend checking it regularly at home. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Monitor it? What for? It's always been a bit high. My wife used to fuss about it, but I felt fine. I don’t want to be fiddling with machines and worrying about numbers. I have things to do. Just sign the paper, doctor. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions about my health. And frankly, this is becoming ridiculous. Do you need me to spell it out for you? I. Need. The. Paper. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand you’re feeling pressured for time and want to proceed with this procedure. However, my responsibility is to ensure your safety. While the procedure itself may be low-risk, an elevated blood pressure could increase complications. I’m hesitant to sign this form without some additional monitoring. I can sign it with the caveat that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician within two weeks to assess your blood pressure and overall health. Would that be acceptable?
