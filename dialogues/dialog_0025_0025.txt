DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, welcome. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. I want... test. For my people. Long, long time ago. I hear you can do this with... spit? To find out where my family come from. I make little boats, you know. Wood. But I want to know where the wood come from, long time ago, with my people.
DOCTOR: A “test” for your people… involving spit?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s right. My niece, she told me. She said you can look at… little things in my spit. And tell me if I have… Chinese blood? Or maybe Spanish? My grandpa, he sail boat. Long, long time ago. From different islands. I just want to know. It’s important to me. I want to show my grandkids where we really come from. Before I… you know. Get too old.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I think your niece may be referring to genetic ancestry testing. We don’t actually perform those tests here at the clinic. It's not standard medical practice, and truthfully, the results can be... complicated. It's not always definitive, and it doesn't necessarily tell you much about your health. However, I can see you’re interested in learning about your family history. I can certainly document that you've expressed this desire. But it’s not something I can assist with directly. Are you having any medical concerns today that prompted this visit, or is this solely about ancestry?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, I see. Not here, you say? Hmm. Complicated… my niece, she no explain very good. She just say you can do. No, Doctor. No sick. Just… curious. Old man curious. I feel okay. Just want to know where my wood come from, you know? My family wood. And show grandkids. Is that… okay? To just want to know? No need test if you can’t. Just… tell me if you know good place for test? Maybe?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be curious about your family history, Mr. Scobie. It's admirable, actually. And wanting to share that with your grandchildren is wonderful. I typically don’t recommend specific companies – there are a lot of direct-to-consumer genetic testing services out there, and the quality varies greatly. I will say, be very cautious about privacy policies and what the results actually mean. They can be misleading. Before we go down that road, let’s just make sure you’re healthy. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Hmm. I go to doctor before, long time ago. For… cough. But that was years. Maybe ten years. I feel strong. I still make boats! Little ones, but strong. But ten years, maybe. I don’t remember very good anymore. I mostly just eat fish and walk. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Walking and eating fish is good. But ten years is a long time. A physical exam would just be a basic check-up – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, maybe some blood work. It's important to make sure there aren't any underlying issues contributing to how you’re feeling, or potentially affecting your health as you get older. We can do that today if you'd like. It’s a standard part of preventative care, and would give us a good baseline. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Check my heart… okay. If you think is good. I trust you, Doctor. If my heart okay, then I can make more boats. More boats for grandkids. Blood work… is that… poke me with needle? I don’t like needle very much. But if you say is important… okay. I do for grandkids. Yes. Okay, Doctor. Check my heart. And… maybe not so much needle, if you can?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. We’ll start with the heart and lungs. And we’ll try to keep the blood work to a minimum – just the essentials. We can discuss the specific tests with the nurse before we proceed. Now, let’s get some baseline information. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I eat lots of things. Fish, coconut, breadfruit… never have problem. Maybe little itchy sometimes when mosquito bite, but that everyone. I live on island, lots of mosquito. No, I don’t think I have allergy. Never been sick from food or… anything. Just old man. But strong old man.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… no, Doctor. None. I don’t take nothing. Just fish oil sometimes. For my bones. My niece, she give me. But is not… medicine, you know? Is from fish. Like I eat. I don’t take pills or… nothing like that. Just fish oil. And fish. Lots of fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications besides the fish oil. That’s good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Long time ago, when I was young man, I fall from coconut tree. Broke my arm. They… fix it. With… white stuff. And… tight wrap. But that was long time ago. Maybe sixty years ago? Maybe more. That only surgery I ever have. Just broken arm. Long, long time ago. I still climb tree sometimes, but not so high. More careful now.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a young man. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is… hard. My grandpa, he sail boat. From different islands. He no tell me much. Just say he travel. My mama, she good fisherwoman. Strong woman. She always fish. My papa… he make canoes. Like me. That all I remember. They all strong. All live on island. Nobody get sick much. But nobody go to doctor much either. We just… strong people. Hard to get sick. That is family history. Strong. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That’s… helpful, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you come from a resilient family. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then we’ll decide if any blood work is necessary. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. Listen to my heart. Good. My heart is strong. I hope. Strong heart for making boats. You check. And then… maybe less needle, yes? I ready. Do what you need to do. My grandkids waiting for boats. Strong boats.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get started. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And another deep breath… in… and out. Your heart rate is a bit fast, but rhythm is regular. Lungs sound clear, but there's some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Blood pressure is elevated - 150/90. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds, and your blood pressure is higher than we’d like. I think some blood work would be beneficial, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. It will help us determine if any further investigation or treatment is needed. It's a standard panel, just to check your kidney function, cholesterol, blood sugar, and a complete blood count. It's a fairly minimal poke, I promise.
PATIENT: Poke… minimal? Okay. If you think is important. For grandkids. And strong boats. I want to see them grow up. And make more boats. Is high blood pressure… bad? Like very bad? Should I stop climbing coconut tree? I like climbing coconut tree. Good view. And good coconuts. But I stop if you say. For grandkids. And strong boats. What does… cholesterol mean? Is that from eating too much fish? I eat lots of fish. Good fish. Healthy fish.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure can be serious if left untreated, Mr. Scobie. It puts extra strain on your heart and can increase your risk of stroke or heart attack. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have to stop climbing coconut trees completely, but we need to get it under control. We can discuss ways to manage it, like dietary changes and, if needed, medication. And cholesterol isn’t directly from eating fish. It’s a fatty substance your body needs to function, but too much can build up in your arteries and cause problems. It's often related to diet – saturated fats and trans fats – and genetics. We’ll know more once we get the blood work results. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It will just be a few vials. After that, we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan to keep you healthy and strong, for many more years of boat-making – and coconut tree climbing, if we can. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think. For grandkids. And strong boats. I trust you. Nurse… poke me with needle? I hope she is gentle. I not like needle. But I do for grandkids. And you help me with blood pressure. And… gentle nurse. And strong boats. And coconuts. Is good plan, yes? I think… maybe I sit down now? Feel a little… tired. Thinking about needle. And blood pressure. And coconuts. Lots of thinking.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that sounds like a very good plan. And absolutely, please sit down. Thinking about all of this is tiring. Let me call the nurse, and then we can get you settled. She’s very gentle, and I’ll be right here if you need anything. We’ll take things one step at a time. Just focus on the strong boats and happy grandkids, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Strong boats. Happy grandkids. And… maybe less thinking about needle. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. And you help me with coconuts later? Maybe tell me how to climb them safely? Old man needs advice.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. I can offer some advice on safe coconut tree climbing. Though I must admit, my expertise is more medical than arboreal. We can look up some resources together online, if you’d like. Safety first, always. Nurse, could you please come in to room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Good. Safety first. You very smart, Doctor. Smart and kind. I hope nurse bring less needle. And strong boats… they need grandpa. They like my boats. Small boats, but strong. Is good to have boats. Better than… no boats. Yes. Better than no boats.
DOCTOR: They certainly do need a grandpa, Mr. Scobie. And I assure you, we'll do everything we can to keep you healthy and strong enough to build many more boats for them. Nurse: Hi Mr. Scobie, I'm here to draw a little bit of blood for the doctor. It will only take a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Hello, Nurse. Minimal poke, yes? Doctor say minimal. And you… gentle? My arm… is old. And I need strong arm for boats. Just… quick, please? And think of strong boats. Happy grandkids. That help. Yes. That help me.
DOCTOR: Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. Minimal poke, I promise. And I'll be as gentle as possible. I've drawn blood from many arms, and I'm very good at it. Think of happy grandkids and strong boats – that’s a wonderful distraction. Nurse: Okay, this might feel like a little pinch. Just try to relax. Nurse: All done! Just a little pressure here for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. Here’s a bandage. Nurse: The doctor will be with you shortly to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Ouch… that was… pinch. But you are gentle, Nurse. Very gentle. Thank you. No more pinch, yes? Just bandage? And wait for doctor? Is good. Just… little tired now. Thinking about boats… and pinch. No questions. Just wait. And think of strong boats.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, no more pinches, I promise. Just a bandage and a little waiting. And you’re absolutely right, thinking about strong boats is a much better use of your energy. The results should be back shortly. In the meantime, I’ll just review your medical history again and prepare a few questions for you. Please just relax and let me know if you feel any discomfort. We’ll get you sorted out, Mr. Scobie. And back to building those boats in no time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And… smart. Very smart. Smart and kind… is good. Is very good. Strong boats… happy grandkids… less thinking about pinch… less thinking about blood pressure… more thinking about coconuts… yes… more thinking about coconuts.
DOCTOR:
