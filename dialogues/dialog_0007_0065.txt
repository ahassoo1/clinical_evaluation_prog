DOCTOR: Hi Reneisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Hernandez. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, I’ve gained a significant amount of weight recently, and I haven’t been able to figure out why. It’s quite unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weight gain can definitely be unsettling when it happens unexpectedly. Let's try to figure out what's going on. When you say "recently," how long has this been happening, and roughly how much weight are we talking about?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think precisely. It began, I would estimate, approximately six months ago. And… oh dear, let me be accurate. I started at 70 kilograms, and now I am… 83. Perhaps a little more, actually. I weighed myself just last week. It is a considerable difference, don’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a significant change in six months. Okay, 13 kilograms... that's about 28 pounds. Has anything changed in your life during that time?
PATIENT: That is… correct, yes. Twenty-eight pounds. It feels… quite a lot. Let me see… changes. Well, my husband, Stefan, retired from the factory in March. That was… a rather large adjustment for both of us. He’s been doing more cooking since then, bless his heart, but… I do not believe that accounts for all of this weight gain. We haven't altered our usual diet otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, Stefan's retirement is a big life change, and it's good you're thinking about that. And you haven't consciously changed your eating habits beyond Stefan doing more cooking?
PATIENT: No, not consciously. He makes… traditional Lithuanian dishes, mostly. Hearty, filling things, but we’ve always eaten those. Perhaps he is using more butter than before? I truly don't know. I haven’t been paying that close attention to the ingredients. He enjoys cooking, and I enjoy eating… It’s a difficult thing to pinpoint, really. I still prepare most of the lighter meals.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, my activity level… Well, I used to walk to the market most days, but Stefan insists on driving now. He worries about me. He says the traffic is too dangerous. So, I walk less. Perhaps… two or three times a week, if that. Mostly around the garden. Nothing strenuous. I do light housework, of course, but… it isn't the same as a proper walk, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it isn’t. Okay, so decreased walking. Have you noticed any other changes – like feeling more tired than usual, changes in your sleep, any changes in your bowel habits, or even changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: That’s a very thorough question, Doctor. Let me consider… I have been feeling rather fatigued lately, yes. More so than usual. I put it down to getting older, truthfully. Sleep… no, my sleep is generally quite good. Bowel habits… no changes there. And my skin… well, it feels a little drier, perhaps. But that is common in the winter months, isn't it? It has been a rather cool summer so far. I haven't noticed anything particularly alarming.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and slightly drier skin. And you said this started around the same time as Stefan’s retirement, six months ago?
PATIENT: Precisely. It seems to coincide rather neatly, doesn't it? Perhaps it is simply adjusting to a new routine. Though… I do worry there might be something more to it. It’s unsettling to gain weight without a clear reason. I've always been… quite stable, weight-wise. It’s never been a struggle for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you're paying attention to this and that you're normally stable. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if anything stands out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I trust your judgment implicitly. I’d like to understand what is happening, if possible.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don't mind, could you please change into this gown?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is a little chilly in here, isn't it? But I understand it is necessary for the examination. Please let me know if there is anything specific I should do or position I need to be in. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No worries, it is a little cool. I'll try to be quick. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Now, I’m just going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels a little enlarged, but not dramatically. I'll also check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay, everything seems generally normal, but that slightly enlarged thyroid is something we'll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh. An enlarged thyroid… That is… concerning. I hadn’t noticed anything myself. Is it… serious, Doctor? My mother had some problems with her thyroid when she was older, but I don’t recall the specifics. It was many years ago. What sort of investigation did you have in mind? I am, naturally, a little anxious now.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned your mother's history. That's helpful information. An enlarged thyroid, or goiter, isn't always serious, but it can be a sign of a thyroid condition. It's important to figure out what's causing it. The investigation I have in mind is a blood test. It will measure your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, and T3 – to see if your thyroid is functioning properly. It will also help us rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order a TSH, Free T4, and Free T3 panel for you. It's a simple blood draw, and we should have the results back in a few days. While we’re waiting, I'd also like to get a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, just to get a broader picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A thorough approach is precisely what I would expect. Please, proceed with all the tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgment completely. A few days is quite acceptable. I am, admittedly, relieved to have a plan of action. I will schedule the blood draw immediately. Is there anything specific I should do or avoid before the test? Perhaps fasting or avoiding certain medications? I want to ensure the results are as accurate as possible.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. I'm glad you feel reassured. For the blood draw, you'll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – no food or sugary drinks, but water is fine. As for medications, please continue taking everything as you normally do unless I specifically tell you to stop. I’m also going to give you a referral to a local endocrinologist, Dr. Kovalev. He's excellent. Having a specialist on board is always a good idea, especially when dealing with thyroid issues. We can discuss the results together and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very sensible indeed, Doctor. An endocrinologist specializing in thyroid issues… that is precisely what I would hope for. Dr. Kovalev, you say? I shall make a note of his name. Fasting for 8-12 hours… I can manage that. Water is no problem at all. Thank you for being so thorough and thoughtful. I feel much calmer knowing we have a plan and a specialist involved. When should I schedule the appointment with Dr. Kovalev? After we have the blood test results?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's schedule the appointment with Dr. Kovalev after we have the blood test results. That way, you'll have a better understanding of what's going on, and you can have a more informed discussion with him. I’m sending the referral to his office now. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. It might take a few days for them to get in touch. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like significant weight loss, rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, or difficulty breathing – please contact me immediately. Otherwise, just focus on getting the blood test done and keeping your normal routine. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been exceptionally thorough and reassuring. I truly appreciate your thoughtful approach and clear explanations. I will schedule the blood test as soon as possible and await the results. I will also keep an eye out for any new or worsening symptoms, as you advised. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I feel much more at ease now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you when the results are back.
