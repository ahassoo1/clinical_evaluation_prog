DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. DeCosta, it’s good to meet you as well. I suppose you could say I’m…evaluating a potential situation. A gentleman caller, if you will. And frankly, I like to be thorough. One simply doesn’t rush into things these days. I want to ensure…everything is as it should be, before committing to anything serious. It's a matter of proper due diligence, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, thoroughness is always a good idea. It sounds like you’re being very proactive about your health, which is wonderful! When you say “evaluating a potential situation,” are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that led you to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Really, Doctor? That’s rather…direct. No, I haven’t a fever or a rash, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s more a matter of…peace of mind. He’s…older, shall we say, and one wants to be certain of certain things, you understand. It’s about being a responsible adult. I just want to make sure everything is functioning properly, as it were. And I’d like a complete check-up, naturally. Everything. Don't spare any details.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Esthela. It’s wise to be proactive about your health, and a complete check-up is a great idea. When you say “everything functioning properly,” can you tell me a little more about what specifically you’re concerned about?
PATIENT: Well, frankly, Doctor, his stamina. It's…a topic. He claims to be quite vigorous, but one must verify these things, mustn’t one? And beyond that, general health, of course. Any…hidden ailments. I wouldn't want to find out after…well, you understand. I need to know if he's going to be…reliable. And a full accounting of any medications he might be taking. I don’t want any surprises. It’s about making an informed decision, truly. Are you capable of such a thorough evaluation?
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, I absolutely am. It sounds like you’re understandably concerned about his overall health and fitness. We can definitely do a comprehensive evaluation, including a physical exam, and discuss any potential concerns. To start, let's talk about your medical history. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, of course I have. I'm not some…careless woman. I see Dr. Hemmings – he's quite good, actually, though a bit…brusque. Last one was, let me see…April, I believe. Blood work, the usual. Everything was perfectly normal, thank you very much. Cholesterol a little high, but nothing a statin can’t handle. Honestly, I maintain an excellent diet. Organic, mostly. And I walk three miles every morning. I expect his results won't be nearly as impressive. Are you going to ask him to do a treadmill test? I think that would be very revealing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Esthela. It sounds like you take very good care of yourself. We can certainly discuss a stress test for him, depending on what we find during the exam and his medical history. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about any past medical issues he may have?
PATIENT: Well, that's the frustrating part, Doctor. He's…vague. He claims to have had “a touch of the flu” last winter, and some “old war injuries,” whatever those are. He served in…Vietnam, I believe. He's not one for details, and frankly, I don’t press him. It’s considered rude, you know. But he does take…a blue pill. He mentioned something about it helping with…performance. That’s all I know. Honestly, it's a bit disconcerting. I’d prefer a complete list of medications, or at least some explanation of what that blue pill is. And has he had any recent surgeries? Or hospitalizations? He’s quite secretive, it’s really rather annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Esthela. It’s definitely concerning when someone is vague about their medical history, especially when you're considering a close relationship. The “blue pill” is likely a medication for erectile dysfunction, such as sildenafil , tadalafil , or vardenafil . These medications require a prescription and can interact with other health conditions or medications. It's important for him to be upfront about everything. Do you have any idea if he sees a regular doctor?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. He brags about being self-sufficient, a “rugged individualist,” as he puts it. Honestly, the whole thing is rather…old-fashioned. He's a bit of a…machismo type, if you understand my meaning. He probably thinks doctors are for the weak. It’s terribly frustrating. He insists he’s perfectly healthy, just needs a bit of “rest.” But frankly, Doctor, I’m not convinced. I suspect he’s hiding something. And that “rest” is likely…well, let’s just say I have my doubts. Is it possible to…require him to disclose his medical information? Perhaps a legal document? I feel I’m being taken advantage of, and it’s simply not acceptable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Esthela. It's absolutely reasonable to feel uneasy when someone is unwilling to share their medical history, especially in a situation like this. While I can't legally force him to disclose information, we can discuss the importance of transparency in a relationship and the potential risks of withholding medical details. Perhaps, if he agrees, he would be willing to come in for an examination. We can explain the benefits of a check-up and how it can provide peace of mind for both of you. In the meantime, let’s focus on what we can do. Do you have his insurance information?
PATIENT: Insurance? Doctor, honestly. He doesn't have insurance. He claims to be “self-insured.” It’s a bit of a…boastful statement, if you ask me. He’s quite proud of his independence. And frankly, it’s rather…unsettling. A man of his age without insurance? It suggests a certain…irresponsibility. And I suspect it also means he avoids doctors at all costs. This is becoming increasingly concerning, Doctor. I feel as though I'm embarking on a fool's errand. Perhaps I should simply terminate the arrangement. But…well, there's a certain…chemistry, you understand. But not if it comes at the cost of my well-being. Is there anything you can do, legally speaking, to ascertain his health status without his consent? Perhaps a subpoena? I’m willing to pursue all available options.
DOCTOR: Esthela, I understand your frustration and concern. You're right to be cautious, and it's wise to protect your well-being. Unfortunately, legally, I am unable to obtain his medical information without his consent. A subpoena would require a legitimate legal case and would likely be unsuccessful without a specific reason to believe he’s concealing information that poses a direct threat to someone. However, there are a few things we can discuss. I can document your concerns regarding his lack of medical care and the potential risks associated with that. And, if you choose to continue the relationship, I strongly recommend open and honest communication. Encourage him to see a doctor, and emphasize the importance of transparency for both of your health and peace of mind. Would you like me to provide you with resources on healthy relationships and communication strategies?
PATIENT: Resources? Honestly, Doctor, I've been in relationships for decades. I hardly need a pamphlet on "healthy communication." It’s the lack of communication that’s the problem, not the technique. And frankly, suggesting I need a lesson in relationship dynamics is rather…patronizing. No, what I need is a solution. A way to ascertain his health status without alerting him to my suspicions. Is there any medical test – a blood sample, perhaps – that can reveal underlying conditions without his knowledge? I know it’s unorthodox, but I’m willing to consider all options. I feel as though I’m walking on eggshells, and it’s simply not sustainable. This is becoming quite the predicament, Doctor. Perhaps terminating the arrangement is the most sensible course of action. But…the chemistry, you understand. It’s a dilemma, truly. Are you certain there's absolutely nothing you can do? Not even a discreet inquiry with a local hospital? I’m willing to offer a generous donation, of course.
DOCTOR: Esthela, I understand your desperation and your desire to find a solution. However, I must emphasize that obtaining medical information without his consent would be a violation of his privacy and would be unethical and illegal. Even a discreet inquiry with a local hospital would be problematic and could have legal ramifications for both of us. I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for, and I sincerely apologize for that. It's understandable to be drawn to someone despite red flags, but prioritizing your own safety and well-being is paramount. Unfortunately, without his cooperation, there's very little I can do to ascertain his health status. I strongly recommend that you consider whether the potential risks outweigh the benefits of continuing the relationship. Perhaps we can shift our focus to supporting your health and well-being?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you are unwilling to assist me in uncovering his secrets, then I shall take matters into my own hands. I have…resources. Discreet individuals who can obtain information without raising suspicion. It may be unorthodox, but I am prepared to do what is necessary to protect myself. In the meantime, I believe a comprehensive check-up for myself is in order. A full panel, if you please. And perhaps a flu shot, even though it’s not yet flu season. I want to ensure my immune system is at peak performance, should…unexpected complications arise. And, Doctor, please keep my concerns confidential. I do not want word of this reaching his ears. It would be…unfavorable. Now, let us proceed with the examination. I trust you have a private room available?
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, absolutely. We have a private room ready for you. I will document your request for a full panel and the flu shot. And I assure you, all of your concerns will remain strictly confidential. I will also note your desire for discretion. Please follow me. We’ll begin with your medical history and then proceed with the physical exam.
PATIENT: Excellent. Promptness is appreciated, Doctor. And Doctor, do you have any recommendations for a good…private investigator? Just in case. A discreet individual, with a proven track record. One never knows when such services might be required.
DOCTOR: That is… outside of my area of expertise, Esthela. I am a physician, not a referral source for private investigators. I can, however, recommend resources for legal counsel if you are considering that option. Maintaining confidentiality and adhering to legal boundaries is paramount in situations like these. Let’s focus on your health check-up for now. Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well. A lawyer can wait. My blood pressure, you say? Do you have a reliable machine, Doctor? Accuracy is of the utmost importance, you understand. I have a rather…sensitive constitution. And I expect a detailed report. Everything documented, precisely and thoroughly. No omissions, no ambiguities.
DOCTOR: Yes, our machine is regularly calibrated and highly reliable. It’s a digital model with a documented history of accuracy. Your reading is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range for your age. It could be due to a variety of factors, such as stress or caffeine intake. I will document all of your vitals and medical history in detail, as you requested. No omissions, no ambiguities. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you had any recent changes in your health, such as weight loss or fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Perhaps a slight…lassitude, Doctor. But that is to be expected, given the…circumstances. And a negligible amount of weight loss. One is simply…less inclined to indulge in rich foods when one is preoccupied. No, my concerns lie elsewhere. My digestive system, for instance. It's been…irregular, shall we say. And a persistent…unease in my abdomen. It could be stress-related, of course. But one must rule out all possibilities. Do you have facilities for…advanced diagnostics, Doctor? A colonoscopy, perhaps? Or an endoscopy? I want a thorough investigation. I leave no stone unturned when it comes to my health.
DOCTOR: I understand. Irregularity and abdominal unease can be quite concerning. We do have facilities for advanced diagnostics, including colonoscopy and endoscopy. However, those procedures typically require a referral from a gastroenterologist. Before referring you, let’s start with some basic tests, such as a stool sample and a blood test to rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. That will help us determine the best course of action. Would you like me to provide you with a collection kit and instructions?
PATIENT: A stool sample. How…pedestrian. But if it’s necessary, then so be it. One must endure certain indignities in the pursuit of good health, I suppose. Very well, a collection kit, please. And detailed instructions. I’m not accustomed to such…procedures. And Doctor, do these tests reveal…everything? All potential ailments? I want a comprehensive report, listing every possible diagnosis. No holding back, no minimizing. And while we’re on the subject of diagnostics, could you also test for…sexually transmitted infections? Just to be thorough, you understand. I believe it's prudent to err on the side of caution in such matters. One never knows.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I can provide you with a stool sample collection kit and detailed instructions. We can also order a comprehensive panel of blood tests, including tests for sexually transmitted infections. It’s important to understand that no single test can reveal every possible ailment. However, these tests will provide us with a significant amount of information and help us identify any potential concerns. I will also provide you with a list of potential diagnoses based on your symptoms and test results, along with a discussion of the possible implications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or latex?
PATIENT: Latex is acceptable. As for medications, I take a low-dose statin, as we discussed, and occasionally an anti-inflammatory for my arthritis. Nothing more. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible, but one must concede to modern medicine when necessary. And Doctor, while we’re discussing…necessities, I have a rather delicate question. Given my…preoccupation, is there a test to determine a man’s…fertility? Just to be certain, you understand. I wouldn’t want any…unpleasant surprises down the line.
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, there are tests to assess a man's fertility. A semen analysis is the most common method, which evaluates the sperm count, motility, and morphology. However, it requires a sample from him, and he would need to be willing to provide it. It’s important to understand that fertility testing is a personal decision, and he may not be comfortable undergoing it. We can discuss the potential benefits and risks, and I can provide him with information if he’s interested. Now, let’s focus on your current concerns. Do you experience any pain or discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain? Intermittent, Doctor. A dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes, seemingly at random. And sometimes, a slight…bloating. It’s quite unsettling, frankly. And it seems to worsen after…certain activities. I suspect it’s something…serious. Perhaps an obstruction? Or a growth? I wouldn't put anything past him, frankly. He's a rather…enigmatic individual. Is it possible to order a CT scan? Just to be certain. I want a comprehensive evaluation, leaving no stone unturned. And Doctor, are you capable of interpreting the results? I wouldn't trust just anyone with such sensitive information.
DOCTOR: A CT scan is certainly an option, Esthela. It can provide detailed images of your abdomen and help us identify any potential obstructions or growths. However, it does involve exposure to radiation, so we need to weigh the benefits against the risks. I am capable of interpreting the results, and I will thoroughly explain them to you. However, depending on the findings, I may recommend a referral to a radiologist for a second opinion. Before ordering the scan, let's discuss your bowel habits. Have you noticed any changes in your stool consistency or frequency?
PATIENT: Consistency? Variable, Doctor. Sometimes…formed, sometimes…less so. And the frequency is…irregular, as we discussed. It fluctuates seemingly at random. It's quite distressing, frankly. And there's been a…slight discoloration. Nothing alarming, but noticeable. Is this…serious, Doctor? Could this be a sign of something…grave? I wouldn't put anything past him, frankly. He's a rather…secretive individual. And I suspect he's hiding something. Perhaps a past illness? Or a…disregard for his health? I need to know, Doctor. I need to be certain. Is a colonoscopy absolutely necessary? Even if it's…unpleasant? I'm prepared to endure any indignity if it means uncovering the truth.
DOCTOR: Esthela, I understand your anxiety and your desire for certainty. The changes you’re describing – variable stool consistency, irregular frequency, and discoloration – are concerning and warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms and your concerns about his potential health issues, a colonoscopy is a reasonable and prudent step. It allows us to directly visualize the colon and identify any abnormalities, such as polyps or growths. I will provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure, and I will discuss the potential risks and benefits with you. It’s important to understand that it does require bowel preparation, which can be unpleasant, but it’s necessary to ensure a clear view of the colon. Before proceeding with the colonoscopy, let's schedule a consultation with a gastroenterologist. They can assess your individual situation and determine the best course of action. Would you like me to provide you with a list of recommended specialists?
PATIENT: Excellent. A consultation with a gastroenterologist is precisely what’s needed. And a list of recommended specialists, please. I prefer someone…thorough. Someone who doesn't shy away from difficult questions. And someone with a…discreet practice. I wouldn't want word of this reaching…unwanted ears. And Doctor, while we’re on the subject of specialists, could you also recommend a…private investigator? Just in case. A discreet individual, with a proven track record. Someone who can…uncover hidden truths. I suspect he’s not being entirely forthcoming, and I need to know…everything. Before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: Esthela, I understand your desire for information and your need to feel secure. However, I must reiterate that recommending a private investigator is outside of my professional scope and ethical boundaries. My role is to provide medical care, and I cannot be involved in any activities that are not directly related to your health. I can, however, provide you with resources for legal counsel if you are considering that option. They can advise you on the legal implications of seeking information about someone else and recommend appropriate investigative services if necessary. Now, let's focus on scheduling your consultation with a gastroenterologist. I have a list of recommended specialists in the area, and I can provide you with their contact information and credentials. Would you like me to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Very well. Legal counsel can wait. For now, the gastroenterologist is paramount. Credentials are essential, Doctor. Someone with a stellar reputation. And someone who…understands discretion. I wouldn’t want my medical history becoming…public knowledge. And while you’re compiling the list, could you also include a…laboratory that specializes in…advanced diagnostics? Someone who can perform a comprehensive panel of tests, leaving no stone unturned. I want to know…everything. Before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I am compiling a list of highly-rated gastroenterologists and advanced diagnostic laboratories in the area, with a focus on those known for their expertise and discretion. I will also include their credentials and contact information. It will take a few moments to gather all of the information. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. There is one more question. A rather…delicate matter. Given my…preoccupation, is it possible to order a test to determine his…genetic predispositions? Something that can reveal any hidden health risks? Perhaps a screening for hereditary diseases? I want to know…everything. Before it’s too late. And, Doctor, could these tests be performed…discreetly? Without his knowledge? I understand it’s unorthodox, but I need to be certain. Before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: Esthela, I understand your desire for information and your concern for your future health. However, I must be very clear: ordering genetic testing without his knowledge or consent would be a violation of his privacy and is ethically and legally unacceptable. It would also be a breach of my professional code of conduct. I cannot and will not participate in any activities that violate someone’s privacy or are not in accordance with ethical and legal guidelines. While genetic testing can provide valuable information about potential health risks, it requires informed consent from the individual being tested. I can, however, provide you with information about genetic counseling and testing services if you and he are both interested in pursuing that option. I understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for, but I must prioritize ethical and legal considerations. Now, let’s focus on the gastroenterologist and advanced diagnostic laboratory list. It’s ready when you are.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you are unwilling to assist me directly, then I shall seek assistance elsewhere. I have…resources. Individuals who are not bound by the same…ethical constraints. But for the sake of appearances, please provide me with the list of gastroenterologists and laboratories. I will, of course, consult with them…discreetly. And I will, naturally, explore all available options. And Doctor, please keep my concerns strictly confidential. I do not want word of this reaching…unwanted ears. Now, let us proceed. Time is of the essence.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. Here is the list of recommended gastroenterologists and advanced diagnostic laboratories. I have included their contact information and credentials. I assure you, all of your concerns will remain strictly confidential. I must reiterate that I cannot be involved in any activities that are not in accordance with ethical and legal guidelines. However, I wish you all the best in your pursuit of information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Thank you for your…assistance. I shall be in touch…if necessary. .
