DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. And how long has this dryness been bothering you, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Hmm… a few weeks, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time… it goes quick when you’re older. Not like when I was a young man, working with the cement. That was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. A few weeks, that gives us a starting point. And is it constant dryness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Mostly constant, I think. Worse when I'm inside, with the… the air. Outside ain't much better, but… inside is worse. You know? Like it sucks all the wetness outta 'em.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. Air conditioning and heating can certainly contribute to dry eyes. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the dryness – any burning, stinging, blurry vision, or a gritty sensation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Gritty... yeah, sometimes. Like sand. Not all the time, but when it's real bad. And… blurry, a little. Not bad enough to stop driving, but… I gotta squint sometimes. Especially at night. Things get kinda… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, gritty sensation and some blurry vision, particularly at night. That's helpful to know. Now, have you tried anything so far to alleviate the dryness, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Nope. Just… tried blinkin' more. Doesn't seem to do much. Never really bothered with… eye drops or nothin'. Always just figured it'd go away. But it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a closer look at your eyes. If you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick examination. I’ll just need you to look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just… don't take too long, alright? Got a bit of things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, which is good. I do notice some mild redness in both eyes, and your corneas appear a little dry. I'm also checking the tear ducts... everything seems to be anatomically normal on initial inspection. I'm going to use a drop to stain your tears. This will help me measure how quickly they evaporate. It’s a quick test, shouldn’t sting much.
PATIENT: A stain, huh? Alright. Hope it don't make things worse. Just let me know if it burns, okay? Don't want to be blinded or nothin'. Old eyes are sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Pipolo. It's a very mild dye; it shouldn’t cause any lasting discomfort or affect your vision. Okay, let's check the results. The test indicates you have moderately reduced tear film breakup time, which confirms your eyes aren’t retaining moisture as well as they should. It's a common issue, especially with age, and can be managed. It doesn’t appear to be anything serious at this point.
PATIENT: Managed, huh? What does that mean? Like… pills? Don't want no pills. I already take enough for my… other things. What kinda managing are we talkin' about? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to take more medication, Mr. Pipolo. We can absolutely avoid pills, if possible. “Managing” in this case means addressing the dryness with simple measures first. The most common approach is artificial tears – eye drops you use several times a day to lubricate your eyes. There are many different brands available, some over-the-counter, some requiring a prescription. We can start with an over-the-counter variety and see if that provides relief. Additionally, I recommend using a humidifier, especially indoors, to add moisture to the air. Avoiding dry environments and minimizing exposure to wind can also help. We can also discuss proper eyelid hygiene – gently cleaning your eyelids to remove any debris that might be contributing to the dryness. We’ll start with these simple steps and see how you respond. If those aren’t enough, then we can consider other options, but we'll try to avoid medication if we can. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Drops… I guess. Better than pills. And a… humidifier? Never had one of them. Eyelid cleaning… sounds kinda silly, but alright. If it helps. Where do I get these drops? And… what kinda brand? Don't want to spend a fortune on somethin' that don't work. Just tell me a cheap one to start with. And how often do I use 'em? Just… give me the basics, alright? I ain't gonna remember a lot of fancy stuff.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I understand wanting to keep it simple. For artificial tears, a good, affordable option to start with is Systane Ultra. You can find it at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, even Walmart. It's generally around $10-$15 a bottle. There are other brands, but Systane Ultra is a good starting point. As for how often to use them, start with 2-3 times a day. If your eyes still feel dry, you can use them more frequently – up to every hour or two. The goal is to keep your eyes comfortably lubricated. There’s no harm in using them more often if needed. For the eyelid cleaning, you can use a warm, damp washcloth. Gently wipe along your eyelids, removing any crust or debris. Do this once or twice a day. I’ll write down these instructions for you. Here you go. “Systane Ultra eye drops, 2-3 times a day as needed. Warm, damp washcloth for eyelid cleaning, 1-2 times a day.” We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you’re doing and adjust the plan if necessary. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A month... alright. That sounds good. Don't want to be comin' back too often. Okay, drops and washcloth. I think I can remember that. Thanks, Doctor. You been real helpful. Now… can I go? Got things to do, you know? Still got a bit of life left in me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. I’m glad I could help. Absolutely, you can go. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if you experience any sudden changes in vision or severe eye pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
