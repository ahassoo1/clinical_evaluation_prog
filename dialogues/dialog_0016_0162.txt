DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time for chit-chat. It’s… my stomach. It’s been puffed up. Bloated. It's annoying, alright? Just… feels full all the time. Is that enough to get started?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. “Bloated feeling, constant fullness” – got it. And when did this start, Lawton?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really remember. A few weeks, maybe? It’s all kind of a blur, to be frank. Things haven’t been… great, since my wife passed. I eat when I remember to, don't eat when I don't. Does that matter? It’s not like I’m living off pizza and soda, if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s just… food.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Lawton. That must be incredibly difficult. And yes, that absolutely matters – a change in eating habits can certainly contribute to stomach issues. So, a few weeks of this bloating, along with some irregularity in your meals... Is the bloating constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Pretty much. Some days it’s worse than others, I guess. Like… after I eat, it gets worse. But even when I haven’t eaten for a while, it’s still… there. Like I swallowed a beach ball. It’s just… uncomfortable. Look, I'm a pile driver operator, alright? I need to be… functional. This isn’t helping. Is there a quick fix for this, or what? I don't have time for a lot of tests and stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your need to be functional, and I appreciate you being upfront about wanting to get this resolved quickly. Constant bloating is definitely something we want to investigate. While I wish there was a quick fix, getting to the root cause is important. Before we talk about tests, let me ask a few more questions. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… gas, obviously. A lot of it. And… sometimes I feel a little… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… sluggish. Tired. But honestly, who isn't tired these days? It’s probably just… life. Look, is it something serious? Because if it’s just gas, I'm wasting my time here. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, gas and a general feeling of sluggishness. I understand your concern about wasting time, Lawton. And I assure you, we’ll try to be efficient. To rule out anything serious, and get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, focusing on your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, doc, you're gonna poke me? Really? I’m a grown man. I’m built for hard work. I don’t need to be poked. But… fine. Do what you gotta do. Just… hurry it up, alright? I have a schedule to keep. Just don’t tell me I have to drink anything nasty. I hate those things.
DOCTOR: No nasty drinks, I promise. Just a gentle exam to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Okay, Lawton, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your stomach sounds first. Then I’ll gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Okay… sounds are a bit hyperactive, which can be normal with gas, but we'll see. Now, a little pressure here… and here… Any discomfort at all?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, kinda. Right… there. On the left side. Not pain, exactly. Just… feels full. Like… pressure. A lot of pressure. And… over here, too. A little. Stop poking, doc. It's making it worse. I knew this was a waste of time. This feels like you're just… prodding at a perfectly good stomach. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I understand. Tenderness on the left side and some general fullness. That's helpful to know. I'm not trying to cause discomfort, just gather information. Given your symptoms – bloating, gas, fullness, tenderness on the left side, and the change in eating habits – it could be something as simple as trapped gas or a bit of indigestion, but we should also rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Constipation? Diarrhea? Look, I'm a pile driver operator, alright? I don’t sit around worrying about that stuff. I eat, I work, I try to stay alive. I guess I… go to the bathroom when I have to go. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not. Is that a good enough answer for you? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This feels like a lot of fuss over nothing. I just want to feel normal again, and get back to work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Lawton. And I apologize if this feels like a lot of fuss. It's important to gather enough information to make sure we’re addressing the issue correctly. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I think it would be a good idea to order a couple of simple blood tests. They can help rule out any underlying inflammation or other issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Seriously? Look, doc, I'm not a fan of needles. And I have a very busy schedule. Can't you just… give me something for the gas? Something to help with the bloating? I’m not asking for a miracle, just something to make me a little more comfortable. I don’t have time for blood tests and waiting and… all that. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Lawton, I understand your frustration and your concerns about time and needles. I truly do. However, simply treating the symptoms without knowing the underlying cause could mask a more serious issue. A simple blood test can give us valuable information and help me determine the best course of action for you. If you're truly opposed to the blood tests at this time, I can prescribe something to help manage the gas and bloating. However, I strongly recommend we revisit the possibility of testing if your symptoms don't improve within a week. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like fever, severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool, or significant weight loss – please seek medical attention immediately. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a gas relief medication?
