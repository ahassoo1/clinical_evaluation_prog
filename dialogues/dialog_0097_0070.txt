DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Georgiou, you say? Hmm. Yes, well... I just moved here. New area, you know? Need to find a doctor. Medicare said to come here. Old doctor… far away. Very far. Not remember name now. Just… check-up, I think? Is that what people do?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. Finding a new doctor when you move can be a bit of a process. And yes, a check-up is a great place to start. It’s good to get a baseline and make sure everything is as it should be. So, just to confirm, you're Kile Szmyd, and you're 58 years old. Do you mind if I ask a few questions to get a better understanding of your overall health?
PATIENT: Fifty-eight, yes. That sounds right. Questions… hmm. Fine, ask. But don’t expect much. Memory… not so good these days. What kind of questions? Important things only, please. Not about… what I had for breakfast. Is that what you want to know? Because I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: No, not breakfast, Mr. Szmyd! Don't worry, I won't quiz you on your daily meals. I just need to get a sense of your medical history, any current problems you're experiencing, and things like that. Let's start with this: have you been feeling generally healthy, or have you noticed any new symptoms lately – anything at all that’s different from how you usually feel?
PATIENT: Usually feel… tired. Always tired. But that’s just… old age, I think. Everyone gets tired when they get old, yes? Not new. Always. Sometimes… achy. Back, mostly. But I work with… faces all day. Bending over. Is normal for my job. Makeup, you know? Performance makeup. Big business. Is that important? Are you a theatre person?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Szmyd. And yes, your job is important. It helps me understand what might be going on. Performance makeup, that sounds fascinating! Lots of bending and looking down could certainly contribute to back pain. So, the tiredness has been ongoing then, not a new development?
PATIENT: Ongoing… yes. Always. Not… suddenly tired. Just… always a little bit slow. Like… a tired bear. Is that… explain it? And sometimes… dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… woozy. Happens when I stand up fast. Old age again, probably. Everything is slower when you get old. You understand. You look young, though. Don’t get dizzy?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Szmyd. “Tired bear” is a very descriptive way to put it! And it’s good you’re able to articulate that. The dizziness when you stand up is something we should definitely look into, even if you suspect it's age-related. It’s important to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past - things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Diagnosed… let me think. Doctors… always poking and prodding. I had something… with my stomach, many years ago. Ulcer, maybe? Took pills. Many pills. Stopped taking them, though. Felt better. And… my back, of course. Always back problems. But not… diagnosed. Just… hurt. Old doctor… gave me something for the pain. Not remember what. Everything is a blur. Old age, yes? Is very frustrating, this memory.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, Mr. Szmyd, and it’s completely understandable. We’ll do our best to piece things together. So, you had an ulcer treated some years ago, and you’ve had ongoing back pain. Now, are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Sometimes. My ex-wife… she always made me take vitamins. Said I needed them. Fish oil, I think. Something with… omega something. Stopped taking them after the divorce. Too much… fuss. Pain relievers… yes, sometimes. When the back really hurts. Little white pills. Buy them at the… drugstore. Not every day. Only when needed. Is that… important? You need to know what little white pills? Is many little white pills in the world.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Mr. Szmyd, if only to rule things out. Knowing what medications you take helps us avoid any potential interactions. If you happen to remember the name of the pain reliever, that would be great, but don’t worry if you don’t. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No… I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes… from the makeup. The cheap stuff. But not a real allergy. Ex-wife… she was allergic to cats. Terrible sneezing. But I am not allergic to anything. I eat everything. Like a… bear, again. Very simple man. Not fussy. No allergies. I promise. Is that good? You like that? No allergies. Easy.
DOCTOR: That is good, Mr. Szmyd. "No allergies" is always a good thing. And the bear comparisons are making my day! Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant medical problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. Difficult question. Not close to family. Mother… gone long time ago. Father… never knew him. Siblings… had a sister, I think. But haven't seen her in… decades. She lived in… Siberia, maybe? Very cold place. Don't remember if she was sick. Old country, you know? People got sick all the time. Not much medicine. Hard life. So… no, I don’t know about family sickness. Sorry. Is not much help, is it? I'm a very… alone man.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s understandable that you don’t have that information. We can still proceed without it. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for the face, you know? Very drying. And bad for the lungs. Makeup artists… we need to take care of the face. Very important. Always told my clients… no smoking. Ruins everything. So, no. Never smoked. Not even tried. Is bad habit. Very bad. You smoke? You should quit. Very good for the… complexion.
DOCTOR: I appreciate the advice, Mr. Szmyd! No, I don’t smoke. Very good point about the complexion. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. Very little. A glass of vodka… with dinner, maybe. Not every day. Only on… special occasions. Like when I get a good review for my makeup work. Or… when I feel very sad. Not much now, though. Too old for sadness. And too old for hangovers. Is not good for the… face, again. Makes you puff up. So, little bit sometimes. But not much. Is that… acceptable? You like that answer?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly acceptable, Mr. Szmyd. Everything in moderation, as they say. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Work… hmm. Performance makeup, you know? Theatre, mostly. Local productions. Sometimes… film. Low budget film. I do everything. Old age makeup, young makeup, monsters… anything they need. Very busy. Long hours. Bending over a lot. Holding still. Is… demanding. But I like it. I make people beautiful. Or scary. Whatever they want. It’s… creative. Is the only thing I'm good at, really. I take pride in my work. Though the pay is… not so good. But is better than nothing. You ever see a play? A good makeup job can make all the difference, you know.
DOCTOR: I absolutely agree, Mr. Szmyd. A good makeup artist is essential! I’ve seen several plays, and you're right – the makeup can truly transform a performance. It sounds like you’re very talented. Okay, Mr. Szmyd, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Exam… hmm. Okay. I suppose so. But be gentle. I'm an old man. And I need to be careful with the face. Don’t want to mess up the… complexion. And please, don’t poke too much. Is sensitive. But okay. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle. And quick. I have a show to… prepare for. Is very important show. Lots of old people. Need good makeup. For… realism.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I will be very gentle, and I promise not to poke too much! And preserving the complexion is a top priority. We’ll keep it quick and efficient. Okay, your blood pressure is 135 over 80. A little bit elevated, but nothing alarming at this point. Let me listen to your heart now. Regular rhythm, no murmurs. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Good air entry on both sides. Everything sounds clear. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Throat looks a little dry, but no redness or swelling. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but that slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. Okay, Mr. Szmyd, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Hmm. Normal limits, you say? Good. I thought so. I take care of myself. Mostly. The blood pressure… is that bad? Should I stop drinking vodka? Just… a little bit, you know? For the… soul. And the dryness… is that from the makeup? Is very drying, you know. I use a good moisturizer, but… maybe not good enough. Is this going to cost me a lot of money, this normal limits? I'm a poor makeup artist. Realistic makeup costs a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Szmyd, but it’s something we want to monitor. We can start with some lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and see if that helps lower it. Cutting back on the vodka could certainly help, but we don’t have to eliminate it completely right away. As for the dryness, the makeup could definitely be contributing. It's common for performers to experience dry skin. A good moisturizer is important, but we might want to consider a different brand or a heavier formulation. And don’t worry, we'll keep the costs reasonable. I'm not going to order a lot of expensive tests right now. We can start with a basic blood workup to get a better understanding of your overall health and see if there are any other contributing factors to your tiredness and dizziness. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. That will give us a good starting point. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a week or so. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A week… hmm. Okay. A week is… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t interfere with the show. I have a matinee on Saturday. Very important matinee. And tests… is it painful? I don’t like needles. And blood… makes me dizzy. You remember I said I get dizzy? But okay. I’ll do it. For the normal limits. And the face. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast? Is very difficult to fast. I get grumpy when I'm hungry. And the grumpy makes the clients nervous. Very bad for business. You understand. Grumpy makeup artist is not good. Just tell me what I need to do. Fasting, needles… is it very expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll make this as comfortable as possible. You do need to fast for about 8-12 hours before the blood draw, so that means no food after midnight the night before. But you can drink water. And honestly, it’s usually pretty quick and not too painful. The lab technician is very skilled. And we'll get it done first thing in the morning, so you'll have the whole day to recover your energy. The blood work will be covered by your Medicare, so there won't be any out-of-pocket expenses. I'm going to give you a lab order slip and instructions on where to go. The lab is just down the street. And please, try not to worry too much. It’s a routine procedure, and it will give us valuable information about your health. After you get the bloodwork done, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can answer for you before you go?
PATIENT: Hmm. No food… just water. Okay. I can do that. Water is good. Makes the skin glow. And the lab is… down the street? Good. Close is good. Not much energy, you know? And no money… that’s very good. I’m a poor makeup artist. Realistic makeup costs a lot. I… suppose that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You’ve been very… patient. Even with the grumpy talk. And the face. Just… one last thing. Is it okay if I call if I… forget something? My memory is terrible, you know. Very terrible. And the show… is very demanding. Realistic makeup… it's a lot to remember. Just… in case. Don't want to forget anything important. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. Please, call anytime if you have any questions or concerns, even if you just want to double-check something. That’s what I’m here for. And don’t worry about forgetting things – it happens to the best of us! Here’s my direct line. Feel free to call anytime. And good luck with the show! I hope it goes wonderfully. Realistic makeup is an art, and I’m sure you’ll do a fantastic job. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
