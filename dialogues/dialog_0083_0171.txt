DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah, hi. My nails. They... not lookin’ good. Something’s up with ‘em, I think. I don’t… remember exactly what is up, just that they’re weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. “Something’s up with your nails.” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… hard to say. They’re just… different. Thicker maybe? And the color… it’s not right. Not my usual. I don’t… I don't usually pay that much attention to my nails, to be honest. Is it serious? Should I be worried? I don’t like doctors much.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation with doctors, Ms. Thut. We'll take things at your pace. It's good you came in to have it checked out. "Thicker and the color isn’t right" is a good starting point. Has this change been gradual, or did you notice it suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I guess. I mean, I didn’t wake up one day with… monster nails or anything. It just kinda… happened. Over time. I mostly noticed it when I was painting them last week. That’s when I thought, “Hmm, those don’t look like my nails.” I use a nice pink, usually. But it didn’t look good, so I just… left ‘em bare. Now I'm thinkin' maybe that was a bad idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual change noticed while painting your nails. And you left them bare after noticing the difference. Have you noticed any pain, discomfort, or changes in the shape of your nails besides the thickness and color?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don’t hurt. They just… look funny. And maybe… a little brittle? Like they could break easy. I was clipping one yesterday and it felt… kinda weird. Not painful, just… not normal. The shape… I dunno. They look… rounder maybe? I don’t usually look at my nails that closely. Honestly, I mostly just want them to look nice. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Thut. It's perfectly reasonable to want your nails to look and feel healthy. So, no pain, but some brittleness and a possible change in shape. Have you noticed this happening on all of your nails, or just a few?
PATIENT: Just a few. Mostly the big toe nails, both of ‘em. And, uh… the one on my index finger, my right hand. The others seem okay, I think. I haven’t really checked all of them, to be honest. I don’t have time for all that. I have a life, you know? But those three… they're definitely different. They look… kinda yellowish, now that I think about it. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Yellowish discoloration is something we’ll want to investigate. Okay, so the big toe nails on both feet and the right index finger nail are affected—thicker, brittle, and yellowish. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Change? Not really. Same routine, mostly. Same nail polish, same shoes, same… everything. I haven't been sick or nothin'. Oh! Wait. I did go to that new nail salon last month. The one down the street. It was… cheaper. Maybe that's it? They used a lot of… stuff. I didn't really pay attention. Should I not have gone there? Is that a bad idea? I don't usually go to fancy places.
DOCTOR: A new nail salon is a very good thing to mention, Ms. Thut. Sometimes, changes in technique or hygiene practices can contribute to nail issues. We'll certainly consider that as a possibility. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any underlying medical conditions, like diabetes or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Thyroid… I don't think so. The doctor told me somethin’ years ago, but I don't remember what. I take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but that's it. And my Medicare covers it, thank goodness. I don't really do a lot of doctor stuff, if you know what I mean. I try to stay healthy, mostly. Eat my vegetables. Walk the dog. Don’t go to fancy nail salons. You know. Normal stuff. This nail thing is… annoying. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Thut. It’s good you’re mindful of your health. And we’ll do our best to get this sorted out. You mentioned taking medication for blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. I’m terrible with names. Let me see… Here, it’s… Lisinopril. That’s it, Lisinopril. Little white pill. Take one every mornin’. And I try not to forget, but sometimes… well, you know. I’m gettin’ older. Things slip my mind. This is why I just wanna fix my nails! Not remember a million details.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Thut. Lisinopril is helpful information. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I don’t like shellfish, but that’s not an allergy, is it? And dust makes me sneeze, but everyone sneezes from dust! I don’t swell up or nothin'. Just normal stuff. I don’t really have any… serious allergies. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Just bad nails and a bad memory. That’s my biggest problem. Now can we just look at the nails? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. Let’s take a look. I'm noting some thickening, a yellowish discoloration, and a slightly brittle texture. It appears the nail bed itself is also a bit irregular. Similar findings here, though perhaps less pronounced. I don’t see any signs of infection at this time, but we'll want to rule that out definitively. Do you feel any tenderness when I gently press on the base of these nails?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn’t hurt. Just… feels weird. Like… different. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t sting or nothin'. Just… not normal. They feel kinda… bumpy, under the polish. You know? I haven’t really thought much about it. I just noticed they looked bad. Is it fungus? Is that what it is? I heard fungus is bad. Is it contagious? Don't tell me I'm gonna get everyone sick. This is why I don't like doctors. It's always somethin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. It’s good you're asking questions. Fungus is a possibility, and it’s a common cause of nail changes. It can be contagious, but it's usually spread through close contact, and it's treatable. However, there are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, so we need to confirm the diagnosis before we proceed. To help us determine the cause, I’d like to take a small sample of the nail clippings for a fungal culture. It’s a quick, painless procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Clippings? You mean… cut off some of my nail? That sounds… awful. Will it hurt? Will they grow back? I just got ‘em trimmed last week. And what if it's not fungus? What if it’s somethin’ worse? I don’t like this at all. I just wanted someone to tell me what was wrong and give me some polish. This is too much. Are you sure you need to cut them? Can’t you just… look at them really hard?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Thut. You’re right to ask questions and voice your concerns. Cutting a small portion of the nail is the most reliable way to determine the cause of the changes. It won’t significantly alter the appearance of your nails, and they will grow back. We’re just taking a tiny sample for testing. Think of it like this: if we don’t know what we’re dealing with, we can’t treat it effectively. It’s better to have a clear diagnosis so we can address the problem properly. However, if you are truly uncomfortable with the clipping, we can proceed with a less invasive approach—a visual assessment and monitoring of the nails. But please understand that this may delay a definitive diagnosis and treatment. What feels most comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is just… a lot. Fine. Cut it. Just… be quick about it, okay? And don’t take off too much. I need ‘em for… things. I have a book club next week and… you know. I need presentable nails. Just… get it over with. But if it hurts, I’m tellin’ you. And you better be nice about it. This whole thing is makin' my head hurt. Can I at least have some water?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. I understand your apprehension, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Here you go. We will only take a small clipping from each affected nail. It will be quick, and I will explain each step as I go. First, I’ll gently clean the affected nails. Then, I’ll carefully clip a small portion of the nail. It may feel slightly different, but it shouldn’t be painful. Afterward, we’ll file the edges smooth. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. And don't poke me with anything. I don't like needles. And what if it’s somethin’ really bad? What if I have to take… pills? Or get… shots? I hate shots. Just get it over with. And tell me how long it’ll take to get the results. I don’t want to be comin’ back here every week. I have a life, you know. This is takin’ up a lot of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. Let’s focus on getting this sample taken, and then we’ll discuss the potential next steps. It’s important to remember we’re just gathering information at this point. The results from the fungal culture typically take 1-2 weeks. We'll call you with the results as soon as they are available, and then we can discuss the best course of action. It may involve topical medication, oral medication, or simply monitoring the nails—we will tailor the treatment to your specific needs. I promise to be as efficient and gentle as possible. Now, let’s begin. This may feel slightly cool.
PATIENT: Ugh. That is cold. Okay, just get it over with. And don't stare at my nails. It's weird. Just… clip. Hurry. And tell me what you’re doin’ so I know it’s not gonna be somethin’ awful. I don't like surprises. This whole thing is makin’ me nervous. Just get it done. And try not to cut me. That would be bad. Really bad.
DOCTOR: I’m just taking a small clipping from the edge of the nail, Ms. Thut. You may feel a slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m being very careful to avoid the skin. Now, I’ll repeat the process on the other big toe, and then on the right index finger. There we go. All done. Just smoothing the edges so they don’t snag. We’ve collected the samples, and that’s the most important part. Now, we’ll send them to the lab for testing. Do you have any questions before we move on?
PATIENT: They look… shorter. And kinda jagged. Are you sure you didn’t mess ‘em up? And what if the results take longer than two weeks? I have that book club, you know. I need presentable nails. And what if it’s really bad? Like… contagious? Will I have to tell everyone at book club? That would be awful. No. I don't think I have any questions. Just… hurry up with the results. And don't call me with bad news. Just… good news. That's all I want. Now can I go? I have errands to run, you know. This whole thing took up a lot of my afternoon. And I need some polish. A nice pink. Not that yellowish stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. I’ve carefully trimmed the nails, and they will grow back quickly. As for the results, it’s unlikely they’ll take longer than two weeks, but if there is a delay, we will certainly let you know. Regarding the possibility of contagion, it's treatable, and we can discuss precautions if necessary. It's unlikely to be a major concern. I've documented everything in your chart, and we will call you as soon as the results are available. Here is a prescription for a topical antifungal cream, just in case it is a fungal infection. Start using it if you notice any worsening of symptoms. It won’t hurt to start it now. And I understand you'd like some polish. I can't offer that here, but I'm happy to recommend a reputable salon in the area. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Topical cream. Ugh. More stuff. Fine. I’ll use it if I have to. But don’t expect miracles. And I don't want to go to some fancy salon. I just want my nails to look normal again. No. That’s it. I think. Just… hurry up with the results. And don’t call me with bad news. I really don't need that right now. Okay. Bye. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I understand. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Have a good afternoon, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
