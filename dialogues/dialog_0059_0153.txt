DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Chagaris, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s… something about a check-up. For… work. They need me to be cleared for something. A performance, I think? Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. It's all a bit of a rush, you see. I just need to get this done so I can get back to… well, to work. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. A work clearance check-up is perfectly alright. It sounds like you're feeling a bit pressed for time, and I understand that. We'll do our best to be efficient. To start, could you tell me a little more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, quite rushed. Thank you. The work… well, I’ve been doing it for a long time now. Mostly at the theaters, you know? Ushering people to their seats, taking tickets… sometimes helping in the lobby. It’s… it’s not strenuous, really. Mostly standing and walking. I’ve done it so long, I barely even think about it anymore. That’s probably why I’m a little vague on the details of this clearance thing. It all blends together after a while. Is… is that enough information?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Krahn. So, primarily standing and walking for extended periods at the theater. It sounds like a relatively low-impact role, but we still want to ensure you're fit to continue it safely. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me if you’ve had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… problems? Hmm. Let me think. It’s been a long time… honestly, I don’t really recall anything major. A few aches and pains, you know, the usual things that come with getting older. My back sometimes bothers me after a long shift, but nothing I haven’t managed. I… I had a cold a few years back, but everyone gets those. I don’t really go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. So, significant problems… no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. It's good you've been generally healthy. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hospitalized… No, no surgeries that I recall. And… no, I don’t believe I’ve ever been hospitalized. Not for anything serious, at least. Maybe when I was a child, for… for something minor, a fever perhaps? But nothing as an adult. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I really apologize if I’m being unhelpful. I just… things slip my mind these days. Is there a way we can speed this along? I have a shift later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Mr. Krahn. It's perfectly normal for memory to change with age, and I appreciate you being honest with me. We can certainly try to be efficient. Let's move on to family history then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or siblings have had?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My parents… they passed away a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to my siblings, unfortunately. We didn’t talk much about… health things. I know my mother… she had some trouble with her… her joints, I think. Arthritis, perhaps? And my father… he smoked for many years, so maybe something related to that? But beyond that, I really couldn’t say. I’m afraid I don't have much information. It’s been a long time, and we just didn’t discuss those things. I’m very sorry. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. We can proceed without detailed information. Now, just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I don't take any medications regularly, so it's not something I've ever had to worry about. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I? Honestly, I pride myself on having a pretty good constitution. I rarely get sick. But no, no allergies that I’m aware of. Can we… are we getting closer to finishing? I really do need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting closer, Mr. Krahn. Just a few more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I used to smoke, many years ago. When I was younger. But I quit a long time ago. Decades, really. And… I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. Just one, usually. Nothing excessive. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’ve always been a fairly… responsible person. Is that… sufficient? I hope I’m not being too vague. I just… this is all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Krahn. Thank you for your honesty. So, you quit smoking decades ago, and you have an occasional glass of wine. Alright, that completes my questions. Now, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead. Please. The quicker we can get this done, the better. I appreciate you being so efficient, Doctor. I just… I really need to get back to work. Do whatever you need to do. I’ll try to be as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles noted. Next, I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but we can discuss that later. Now, I'll check your pulse and temperature. Your pulse is 72 and your temperature is 98.6, both within normal limits. Finally, I'll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears look clear, your nose is unremarkable, and your throat is clear as well. No signs of infection. Everything seems within normal limits for your age and stated activity level, though your blood pressure is a bit elevated.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that… that sounds good, doesn’t it? No problems. I knew I was alright. The blood pressure… is that something I should worry about? But otherwise, everything is okay? Can I… can I go now? I really do need to get back to the theater. They’re probably wondering where I am. I appreciate your help, Doctor. Truly. Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms to sign? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, everything seems generally okay. The elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need treatment immediately, but I would recommend checking it regularly – perhaps at a pharmacy, or you could purchase a home blood pressure monitor. We can discuss lifestyle modifications to help lower it, such as reducing salt intake and getting regular exercise. I'll fill out a work clearance form stating you're medically fit to perform your duties with the recommendation to monitor your blood pressure. Here you go. This form indicates you are cleared for work, with a note about monitoring your blood pressure. Do you have any other medical conditions or concerns you would like me to address today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. Monitoring… yes, I can do that. I’ll try to remember. A home monitor… maybe. I’ll think about it. No, no other concerns. Just… work. And getting older, I suppose. But that's just… life. No, no, I think that's everything. Truly. Is there a copay or anything? I don't want to cause any trouble. I really appreciate your efficiency, Doctor. I’ve got a show to get to!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. Since you are uninsured, the fee for the consultation is $100, payable at the front desk. Here’s a card with my contact information, should you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you all the best with your work and your show! If you do decide to monitor your blood pressure at home, don’t hesitate to call and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Thank you for coming in today. Have a wonderful day!
PATIENT: Oh, $100. Yes, yes, that's perfectly alright. Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve been very kind. And thank you for the card. I will… I'll try to remember to call if I get a monitor. Have a good day to you as well! And thank you again. I really appreciate it. .
