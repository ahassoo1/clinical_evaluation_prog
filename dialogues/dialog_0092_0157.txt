DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see why I even had to come in. It's just a number, right? My husband made me. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Dudeney. While it is just a number, that number gives us important information about your health. Your husband is right to be proactive. Even if you feel fine, consistently high blood pressure can lead to serious problems over time. It's good he encouraged you to come in so we can take a look at it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first found out about your blood pressure being elevated?
PATIENT: Elevated? I guess when I had that check-up at work, a couple months ago? They just… told me it was high. I didn't even ask what that meant. It's not like I feel bad. I’m perfectly fine. I work hard, I keep busy. It's probably just the machine was wrong. Those things are always off.
DOCTOR: I see. So the reading was at your workplace check-up a couple of months ago, and you haven't had it checked since then?
PATIENT: No. And honestly, I don’t plan on it, unless… unless you tell me I absolutely have to. I have things to do. This is taking up my whole morning already.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being upfront with me, Ms. Dudeney. We can certainly discuss the potential benefits of further investigation versus simply monitoring things. To help me make the best recommendation for you, let's go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. First, do you have any known medical conditions – anything you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’ve never been sick a day in my life. Seriously. Maybe a cold once or twice as a kid, but that's it. My husband always gets everything, but it never sticks to me. I’m just… healthy, okay?
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Like I said, healthy. I don’t waste time with doctors. My grandmother had some problems… hip replacement, I think? But that was old age. I'm not old. I’m… still young.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Honestly? It’s complicated. My mother’s side… there was some diabetes, maybe? And heart trouble, way down the line. But they didn't take care of themselves. They ate fried food all the time and sat around. I’m nothing like them. My father’s side… I don’t even know them very well. He left when I was little. It's not really important, is it? I mean, I’m healthy.
DOCTOR: It's helpful information, even if it feels distant. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Do I look like the type? I work a demanding job. I need to be sharp. All that stuff just slows you down. I drink water. And sometimes coffee, to get through the day. But that’s it. Nothing else. My husband… he likes a beer now and then, but I don’t touch it. It’s a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband is always careful with what he eats, but I never have to worry about that. It’s just… easier this way. I don’t understand why people have allergies. Seems like a weakness, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I told you, I don’t take anything. I get everything I need from my food. And water, of course. I don't need pills. They just cause problems. My neighbor takes a bunch of stuff for her arthritis, and she feels awful all the time. I'll stick to being healthy, thank you very much. Are we almost done? This is really cutting into my day.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're almost finished with the history. Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify something. You mentioned feeling perfectly fine, and that's important. However, high blood pressure often has no symptoms, especially in the early stages. That’s why it's often called the "silent killer." To get a better understanding of your current blood pressure and overall health, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More poking and prodding? Fine. Get it over with. But I’m telling you, it's going to be normal. Perfectly normal. And then can I leave? I have a deadline. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. Wasting my time and money. But my husband… he’d be furious if I refused. Just hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudeney. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. Please sit back and relax. Okay, I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. Try to relax your arm and don’t talk while I take the reading. Your blood pressure is 158/92. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we should monitor. Your lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal, and motor function appears intact. Okay, Ms. Dudeney. Those were the basic parts of the exam. The elevated blood pressure reading and the heart murmur are what I'd like to discuss further.
PATIENT: Elevated? See! I knew something was wrong with the machine! It's faulty. It's always the equipment. And a murmur? What does that even mean? You're just trying to scare me into taking pills. This is exactly what I was afraid of. Can we just… forget the whole thing? I feel fine. Perfectly fine. My husband is going to be so annoyed. He's always jumping to conclusions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudeney. It’s not my intention to scare you. However, dismissing the readings entirely isn't the best course of action. It is possible the machine has a slight inaccuracy, which is why I'd like to take your blood pressure again in a few moments, and we can compare the results. As for the murmur, it simply means there's an extra sound when your heart beats. Many murmurs are harmless, but it's important to investigate to determine the cause. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a few simple tests. An EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, a blood test to assess your overall health and kidney function, and potentially a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor to get a more accurate reading throughout the day. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? More appointments, more waiting, more poking and prodding? No. Absolutely not. I told you, I feel fine. I do not need tests. This is ridiculous. My husband is going to be furious, but frankly, I don't care anymore. I'm not wasting any more of my time on this. It's a waste of money, and it's just going to stress me out. I’m leaving. Thank you for nothing. And tell the machine people to fix their equipment! .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand your decision, but I strongly advise you reconsider. Ignoring elevated blood pressure can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. I respect your autonomy, but I am concerned about your well-being. Please take this information with you. It outlines the risks of untreated hypertension and the benefits of early intervention. If you change your mind, or if you experience any symptoms such as severe headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Dudeney. I wish you all the best.
