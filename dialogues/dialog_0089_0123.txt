DOCTOR: Hi Carla, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin. That is frustrating. A few weeks ago… Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's all over, really. My arms, my legs, even my back. It’s not… like a rash, exactly. No bumps, just… really dry and it feels like something is crawling on me sometimes, even when it isn’t. And it gets worse at night, you know? Keeps me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's widespread – arms, legs, back – and more of an itch than a visible rash. No bumps, just dryness and that crawling sensation, worse at night. That’s helpful. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Not really. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. I did change laundry detergents, now that you mention it. Maybe a month ago? A new kind with, you know, extra softening agents. I thought it might be nice, but… Maybe that’s it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a change in laundry detergent about a month ago. That's a good thing to point out. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the itch. No fever, no tiredness… nothing like that. It just… is. It’s just really annoying. And sometimes, when I scratch too much, it gets a little… raw, you know? But no blisters or anything scary like that. It's just making me miserable.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no other symptoms – no fever, fatigue, or visible blisters. Just the itch and some raw skin from scratching. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been pretty well controlled with medication for years now. And… oh, arthritis, in my hands mostly. It flares up sometimes, but I mostly manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers. Nothing else, really. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. Well, mostly. Except for this itch!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and arthritis in your hands, managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take Ibuprofen, just as needed. That’s it, really. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung since I was a little girl. Nothing serious, anyway. I'm pretty good with food too, I eat almost anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my father had… heart trouble, I believe. Nothing else that I can really think of. My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. We don't really talk about health much. Does that help? I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of type 2 diabetes in your mother and heart trouble in your father. That’s helpful. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your skin. Can you please point to where the itching is the worst?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s really all over, but… here, on my arms, it’s particularly bad. And my back, I can’t reach it very well, but it’s very itchy there too. It’s hard to say exactly, because it’s everywhere, but those are the worst spots, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some dryness on your arms and back, but no rash or obvious signs of irritation. Skin temperature is normal. Lymph nodes do not appear to be swollen. Let’s consider a few possibilities. Given the timing and the change in laundry detergent, it could be contact dermatitis, an allergic reaction to something in the detergent. The itching being worse at night is common with a lot of skin conditions.
PATIENT: Oh, that makes sense. The detergent… I should have thought of that sooner! So, what do I do about it? Is it something serious? Will I have to stop using the detergent?
DOCTOR: It’s not usually serious, Carla, but it is very uncomfortable. And yes, stopping the new detergent is a good first step. I recommend switching back to your old detergent and see if that improves things. We can also try a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer a couple of times a day. Something like Cetaphil or Eucerin. If the itching doesn't improve within a week or two, or if it gets worse, we may need to consider other possibilities, like a mild steroid cream. Are you able to switch detergents easily?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s no problem at all. I have a whole shelf of them in the laundry room! I’ll switch back to the old one right away. And I can get the moisturizer. Cetaphil, you said? Okay, I can do that. I really appreciate you figuring this out, Doctor. It's been driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Yes, Cetaphil or Eucerin. Either one is fine. And you’re very welcome, Carla. We’ll start with those changes and see how you do. I’m going to write down some instructions for you, including when to call if things aren’t improving. If the itching spreads, or if you develop any fever, blisters, or signs of infection, please call us right away. Otherwise, let’s check back in a week or two to see how you’re doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A week or two. I’ll switch the detergent today, and get the moisturizer. And I’ll remember what you said about calling if things get worse. Thank you so much for your help. I feel much better already, just knowing what might be causing it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. I'm glad I could help. Here are those written instructions. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’m happy to help. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Roseburrough. You too. I will. Goodbye.
