DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day. I'm Kern Trendler. And frankly, it's about this. It's…not what it used to be, you understand? Getting old ain't for the weak. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. "Not what it used to be" can mean a lot of things, though. Could you tell me a little more specifically what's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Everything's bothering me! It's…loose. Saggy. Like a bag. I used to be solid, you see? A proper build. Now? I look like I been wrestling with a jellyfish. And it’s embarrassing, if you must know. I used to wear nice shirts, now everything feels…wrong. Is that clear enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. So, you're experiencing a noticeable change in your abdominal area - a loss of firmness, some sagging. And this is causing you some discomfort and affecting your self-confidence, is that right?
PATIENT: Comfort? No, not pain. Just…disappointment. And annoyance! I ain't asking for much, you know? Just want things back to…respectable. Look, I spent my life building things, proper things, as a pile driver operator. Strong, solid. I want me to be solid again. What can you do about it? No need for long explanations, just the facts.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I appreciate you being direct. There are a few possibilities for changes like you're describing. It could be related to muscle loss with age, some fat redistribution, or even changes in the skin's elasticity. Sometimes it’s a combination of those things. To get a better idea of what’s going on, and what options might be best for you, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history and do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Medical history? Exam? Look, I told you what's wrong. It's sagging. What more do you need to know? I don’t have time for all of that. I ain’t sick. Just…old. Can't you just…pull it tight or something? Is that even possible? Don't tell me about muscles and skin, just tell me if you can fix it. And how much it will cost. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. You’re right, you've explained the issue very clearly. And yes, there are procedures that can address some of these concerns. However, before we discuss those options, it’s important to ensure you’re a good candidate and that there aren’t any underlying medical conditions that could affect the outcome or make a procedure unsafe. It's standard practice, and it's for your well-being. Just a few quick questions then, to get a basic understanding. Do you have any existing medical conditions like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heart problems? Good heavens, no! I've always been strong as an ox. Pile driver operator, remember? Lifting steel all day. No time for being sick. I smoked a few cigarettes when I was younger, but I quit years ago. And I had a bad knee once, playing football, but that was ages ago and it’s mostly better now. Satisfied? Now, about this…tightening. How much are we talking? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. So, no current medical conditions, history of smoking but you’ve quit, and a past knee injury. Regarding the "tightening" you mentioned, there are several procedures available, ranging from minimally invasive options like skin tightening with radiofrequency or ultrasound, to more involved surgical procedures like a tummy tuck . The cost varies significantly depending on the chosen procedure, the extent of the work needed, and other factors. Before discussing specific costs, I really do need to do a quick physical exam to assess your skin elasticity, the amount of excess tissue, and your overall health. And it would be helpful to review your medical records if you have them available. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Records? Exam? Look, I'm a practical man. I see something's loose, you see something's loose. What more is there to examine? I ain't paying you to ask a million questions and poke around. Just tell me if you can fix it and how much it will cost. If it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else. Simple as that. I haven’t got all day for this. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you I’m not trying to waste your time. However, performing any procedure without a proper assessment could be risky. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might affect the outcome or increase the risk of complications. I’m concerned about proceeding without a physical exam and review of your medical history. If you're unwilling to allow me to do so, I unfortunately won’t be able to offer any treatment options. It wouldn't be ethical or responsible of me to do so. I can provide you with a list of other local providers if you'd like. Perhaps they might be a better fit for your needs.
PATIENT: Hmph. So, you're saying you won't do it. After I came all the way here? Waste of my time. Fine. I’ll go somewhere else. Somewhere that understands a practical man when they see one. And frankly, I think I'm better off looking like this than having someone poke and prod at me with no guarantee of success. Don't bother with a list. I’ll find someone who gets straight to the point. Good day.
