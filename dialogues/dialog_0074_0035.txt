DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Reisig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you as well. Oh, well… it’s these hiccups! They’ve been going on for… goodness, I don’t even know how long anymore. A couple of days, I think? It's just so… annoying. And they come and go, you see. Not constantly, thankfully. But when they do come, they’re quite strong.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive. A couple of days is a bit longer than we’d typically expect them to last on their own. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, they just… happen. No rhyme or reason, really. I was having a cup of tea yesterday and hic! one just popped up. Then nothing for a good hour, and then… hic! another one while I was weeding the garden. It doesn't seem to be connected to anything I’m doing. And they’re… well, quite forceful, as I said. Not little tiny ones. They make me jump, honestly. And sometimes, it feels like something… catches in my chest when I get one. Not painful, just… odd.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Mirriam. It does sound a bit unusual for them to be so forceful and accompanied by that sensation in your chest. Let's try to rule out anything serious. First, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I've been a little tired lately, but that’s just getting old, I reckon! I sleep alright, but don't have the energy I used to, you know? And… now that you mention it, my appetite hasn’t been the best. I haven't been eating as much as usual. Not because I feel sick, just… not hungry. Oh! And a little bit of heartburn now and then, but that happens when I eat spicy food, so I don’t worry about that too much. Does that help? I’m trying to remember everything… it’s hard sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mirriam. Thank you for sharing all of that. The tiredness and decreased appetite, along with the heartburn, are all things we should consider. Now, let's go over a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, goodness, must be twenty years now. And I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is why I walk with a cane sometimes. Nothing major, you know? Oh! And the doctor told me my blood pressure is a little high, so I take a pill for that. Just one a day. Apart from that… I think that’s it. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I don’t go to the doctor much, unless something’s really bothering me. Like these hiccups! They’re driving me mad.
DOCTOR: It's good you’ve been generally healthy, Mirriam. And it’s good you’re managing your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you're asking a tricky question! Let me see… it’s a little white pill, and it has some writing on it… hold on a moment… Ah, here we are. It says… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. That’s it. My daughter helps me keep track of these things, you see. I’m not very good with remembering names. And I don’t like to bother the doctor’s office unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mirriam. Lisinopril is very helpful to know. And don’t worry about remembering – that's perfectly alright. Now, are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any other medical problems we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the mosquito bites from the garden! And… no, I can’t think of anything else. I don’t have any trouble breathing, and my heart feels alright. Oh! Except maybe a little fluttery sometimes, but that only happens when I get excited. Like when my grandchildren come to visit! It doesn’t worry me. I’m a pretty healthy old woman, really. I just want these hiccups to go away! They’re so embarrassing.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mirriam. It’s reassuring that you haven’t had any significant allergic reactions and that your heart flutter is associated with happy moments. Now, let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a bit complicated, you see. My mother had… well, she had a bit of trouble with her digestion, I think. Always complaining of stomach aches. And my father… he had high blood pressure too, like me. And his brother… he had something with his heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. My family wasn’t one for talking about these things, you know. They just… suffered through it. And I suppose I’m doing the same. But these hiccups… they’re different. They’re just… persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mirriam. It's common for family medical history to be a bit unclear. Knowing about the digestive issues and high blood pressure is still helpful, though. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I live alone in my own little house. I like to keep busy. I do a bit of gardening, as you know, and I enjoy cooking. I used to go to church every Sunday, but it’s a bit hard to get there now. I don’t drive anymore. And I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but I’ve cut back on that too. Just a small glass now and then. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables. And I walk around the house a bit, but I don’t do much strenuous exercise. Just taking it easy these days, you know? Mostly just trying to enjoy my life. But these hiccups are making it hard to enjoy anything!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mirriam. That gives me a very good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll gently feel your abdomen. Then I’d like to check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Reisig. I trust your judgment. You've been very patient with my rambling. I do tend to go on a bit, don’t I? Go ahead, please. I'm ready whenever you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what's causing these pesky hiccups! It’s just… so tiring, you know? Having to hic! all the time. It’s a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mirriam. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. Your heart sounds regular, although a little bit fast. Your lungs sound clear – no wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a little tenderness in your upper abdomen, just below your rib cage. It’s not sharp pain, but it’s definitely there. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, everything seems to be within normal limits, but the tenderness in your upper abdomen, combined with your history of gallbladder removal and forceful hiccups, is a little concerning. It’s unlikely to be your gallbladder at this point, but it could be related to your stomach or esophagus. I'm going to order a few blood tests and an upper endoscopy to get a better look at what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests and an endoscopy… that sounds… thorough. I suppose it’s best to be safe, though. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment, Dr. Reisig. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. I’m not a fan of hospitals, you know. I just want these hiccups to go away, and I want to get back to my gardening. What exactly does the endoscopy involve? And will the blood tests take long? I have my grandchildren visiting next week, and I don’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mirriam. It’s completely reasonable to be anxious about these tests. The endoscopy involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end that we gently insert down your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to look for any abnormalities. It's usually done under sedation, so you won’t feel any discomfort. It will take about 30-60 minutes. The blood tests will just involve a routine panel to check your overall health, look for inflammation, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. It shouldn’t take long – we can get the results back within a few days. I’ll write you a referral for the endoscopy and order the blood tests now. We’ll schedule the endoscopy as soon as possible, and I’ll call you as soon as we have an appointment time. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help reduce the acid in your stomach, which may help alleviate the hiccups. It’s called Omeprazole. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Omeprazole… yes, that sounds alright. Anything to stop these hiccups! Sedation sounds good too. I’m not fond of being awake for procedures, you know. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Reisig. You’ve been very patient with me. I just hope it's nothing serious. I really do want to see my grandchildren next week. When I do get the results, will you call me personally? I get a little confused with paperwork sometimes, and I don’t want to miss anything important. And… is there anything I should do to prepare for the endoscopy? Any special diet or anything?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mirriam. I will personally call you with the results. I understand your concerns about paperwork, and I'll make sure you have everything you need. As for preparing for the endoscopy, you'll need to fast for at least six hours beforehand – meaning no food or drink. We'll give you specific instructions with the referral, but that's the main thing. It’s also important to arrange for someone to drive you home afterward, as the sedation will make you a little drowsy. And please, let me know if you have any allergies or take any medications, especially blood thinners. I’m going to write up the referral now and get the blood tests ordered. We’ll get everything scheduled as quickly as possible. In the meantime, try to relax and get some rest. I’m hopeful we can figure out what's causing these hiccups and get you feeling better soon. Do you have any other questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Dr. Reisig. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. Just getting these tests done is a relief, really. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. And thank you again for calling me personally with the results. That puts my mind at ease. Alright, well, I should probably be getting home now. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, try to relax and take care of yourself. I’ll be in touch soon with the results. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again.
