DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is... a pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm. What brings me in... yes. It is... the words. They do not come so easy now. It is difficult. I forget... what I wish to say, sometimes, before I even say it. It is very strange. I am Sherrell Gyamfi, by the way. Perhaps you have it there?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gyamfi, I do have your information here. It says you're experiencing difficulty with finding the right words. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: How long... hmm. That is... a good question. It feels like... some time now. Not sudden, you understand? More... a slow fading, perhaps? I do not know exactly. Maybe... six months? Or is it more? It is difficult to say, Doctor. I do not keep good track of time these days. My wife... she always did that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over approximately six months. And would you say it’s getting worse over that time?
PATIENT: Yes. I believe so. It is... frustrating. I used to be very good with words. I worked with... compensations, and benefits, and job analysis. Very precise work, you see? Now... now I stumble, and I search, and sometimes I just... stop. It is not a good feeling. I worry... I worry about what it means.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gyamfi. That sounds very distressing. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how it’s difficult?
PATIENT: How it is difficult... hmm. Sometimes the word is... on the tip of my tongue, you understand? I know the word, I can almost feel it, but I cannot... grasp it. Other times, it is as if the word... does not exist. I know what I mean to say, but I cannot find any word to say it. It is very strange. And it is not just small words, Doctor. Big words, important words... they vanish too. It makes it very hard to... to explain things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes it’s a feeling of the word being just out of reach, and other times it’s difficulty finding any word at all. Are you experiencing this difficulty more with speaking, or with writing, or both?
PATIENT: Both, I think. But more with speaking, perhaps. When I write, I have time to... think. To search. To try different things. But speaking... it is quick. It needs to be fast. And the words... they do not come. Sometimes I pause so long, the other person... they look worried. It is... embarrassing. It was never like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand. And are you noticing any difficulty with understanding what others are saying, or with remembering things?
PATIENT: No, not really. I understand what people say to me. Perfectly. And my memory... well, it is not what it used to be, but I do not think that is new. My wife... she always said I was forgetful. It is just the finding of the words that is the problem, Doctor. Not the understanding, or the remembering... just the speaking. It is a very... specific problem. Perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty primarily with expressing yourself verbally, not with comprehension or general memory. Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as headaches, weakness, numbness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: No. No headaches. No weakness... I feel my strength is... normal. No numbness. And my vision... it is not so good, but it has never been. I wear glasses, you see? Just the words, Doctor. That is all. It is… most peculiar. I feel otherwise quite well. For an old man, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Yes, well… my wife always managed the medical things. I… I believe I have high blood pressure. She made me take pills for it. And… perhaps some cholesterol problems? I am not very good at remembering these things. She kept all the records. And… she always said I needed to watch my diet. But… it was her job, you see? I am sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s common for patients to not remember all the details of their medical history. We can look it up in your electronic health record. Just one moment… Okay, it looks like you have been diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Are you currently taking any medications for these conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I have… a little orange pill for the blood pressure. And a white one for the… the cholesterol, I believe. I take them every morning. With my breakfast. My wife… she always made sure I did. I still take them, of course. I do not want to… change anything. I hope I am remembering correctly. It has been… a difficult time since she passed. Everything feels a little… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you are taking amlodipine and atorvastatin. And how long have you been on those medications?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Years, I think. Perhaps… ten years? Or more? It is hard to say. I have been taking them since… well, since my wife started worrying about my numbers. She was very… careful. She always took me for check-ups, and she made sure I ate the right things. I just followed her instructions. I never really paid much attention to the details. I am sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s understandable. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… I had a cataract removed from my right eye, about five years ago. That is all I can remember, Doctor. Nothing else. I do not believe I have had any other surgeries. Perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and cataract surgery on your right eye five years ago. Now, are you currently experiencing any other medical problems, such as pain, fatigue, or changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: No, no pain. And… no, I do not feel particularly tired. My appetite is… normal. I eat what is put in front of me. And my weight… well, it is probably a little too much, but that is nothing new. I always enjoyed a good meal. I suppose I am just an old man, Doctor. Things… slow down as you get older.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. And finally, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of any family members who have had similar problems with memory or speech, or any neurological conditions like stroke or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. My mother… she was a little forgetful in her later years, I think. But it was just… old age, we thought. She never had any trouble with speech, though. And my father… he was very healthy, as far as I know. He worked hard all his life. No, I do not believe anyone in my family had any problems like mine. It is… a little worrying, to be honest. It feels… new. Very new.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for that information, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, I’d like to perform a brief neurological exam and some cognitive testing to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to find out what is happening, if you can. I just… want to be able to speak again, like I used to. I trust your judgment. Please, do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with a few simple tests. First, could you please tell me your current date and location?
PATIENT: Yes. Today is… August second, 2025. And… we are at… your clinic, Doctor. A very nice clinic, by the way. In… the rural area, I believe. My wife… she always knew where we were. I never paid much attention. I am sorry. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, can you please repeat these three words for me: apple, table, penny. I’ll ask you to recall them later. Apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. I have them. I hope I remember them. It has been… a difficult day.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, I’m going to ask you to perform a few simple tasks. First, can you please point to your right ear with your right hand?
PATIENT: Yes. Here. Is this correct, Doctor? I am not very good at these… tests. I used to be very good with my hands, though. I built many things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… difficult. Let me see… d-l-r-o-w? No… is that right? I am sorry. I am having trouble with that. My mind… it feels a little foggy. Is that correct, Doctor? Or am I… mistaken?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi. It's a challenging task. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you tell me if you remember them?
PATIENT: Hmm. Apple… yes, I remember apple. And… table, yes. But… penny? No. I cannot remember penny. I am sorry, Doctor. I had them just a moment ago, I think. But now… they are gone. My memory… it is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, including checking your vital signs, neurological reflexes, and possibly listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what is happening, if you can find out. And… if there is anything that can be done. Please, do whatever you need to do. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 72. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Now, let’s check your gait and balance. Please, stand up and walk a few steps. Your gait is steady, and your balance appears normal. Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, that concludes the physical exam. Everything appears normal overall. Now, based on your history, symptoms, and exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing early signs of mild cognitive impairment, possibly related to vascular factors or age-related changes. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to assess for any structural abnormalities or evidence of small vessel disease. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Oh. Mild cognitive impairment? MRI? Those sound… serious, Doctor. I do not know… I am not sure. My wife… she always handled these things. What… what does it mean? Is it… bad? And… what if something is found? I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I am a little… scared. What are the risks of the MRI? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know… what is happening to me. If you think it is necessary, then I suppose I am willing, but I am a little… anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s perfectly natural to be concerned when facing uncertainty. Mild cognitive impairment means that you’re experiencing more memory problems than is typical for someone your age, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you have dementia. It can be caused by a variety of factors, and in many cases, it progresses slowly or doesn’t progress at all. The MRI is a painless imaging test that allows us to visualize your brain and look for any structural abnormalities, such as small strokes, tumors, or atrophy. It’s a very safe procedure, but there are a few potential risks, such as claustrophobia, allergic reaction to the contrast dye, or rarely, injury from the magnetic field. However, these risks are very low, and we'll take precautions to minimize them. The results of the blood tests should be available in a few days, and the MRI results may take a week or so. Once we have the results, we can discuss them with you in detail and develop a plan of action. This may include medication, lifestyle changes, cognitive therapy, or further evaluation by a neurologist. I understand this is a lot to take in, and you’re feeling anxious. If you’d like, I can refer you to a neurologist for a second opinion, or we can discuss your concerns with your family. Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail, or would you prefer to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it further?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that helps a little. It is good to know there are options. And that it is not necessarily… bad. A neurologist… perhaps that would be a good idea. A second opinion… yes. And yes, please, schedule a follow-up appointment. I need… time to process all of this. And to… talk to someone. I do not have any family left, so… perhaps a friend. Please, go ahead and schedule the tests and the follow-up appointment. And… thank you again, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m glad I could help. I’ll go ahead and schedule the blood tests and the MRI for you, and I’ll also make a referral to a neurologist. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here is a list of the laboratory, imaging center, and neurologist's contact information, along with some informational pamphlets about mild cognitive impairment and memory loss. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all for now, Doctor. You have answered all my questions. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. It has been… a difficult day, but I feel… a little better knowing what is happening. I appreciate your help. I will contact the clinic if I have any questions. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Goodbye.
