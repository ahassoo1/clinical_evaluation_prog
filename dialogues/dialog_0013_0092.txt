DOCTOR: Hi Oreste, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Dr… Morenomartinez, you say? Yes, yes. Well, it’s this… breathin’. Gets harder, you know? And my mouth… feels like the desert. Eyes too. Everything's just… dry. It's been happenin' for a while now, I think. Can’t rightly say how long. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Shortness of breath and dryness – mouth and eyes, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it. Dry. Everything’s dry. I drink water, lots of it, but it doesn't seem to help much. It's… bothersome. Used to be able to work all day out in the sun, directin’ traffic. Now… not so much. Not that there's much traffic to direct these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first start noticing this dryness and shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that’s a good question. Honestly? Can’t quite put my finger on it. A few months, maybe? A long few months. Everything kinda… blends together when you get to be my age, you know? I wouldn't say it was sudden, more like… slowly creepin' up on me. It’s not like I’m dyin’ or somethin’, is it?
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. We're just trying to figure out what's going on. A few months… okay. Has anything specifically made it worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse? Let me think… Well, the heat, for sure. This summer's been a scorcher. Makes everything ten times worse. And… I don’t know. I been feelin’ kinda… tired, too. Just generally run down. But I’m an old man! What do you expect? It’s probably just the age, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness with the heat making things worse… And you mentioned drinking a lot of water, but it doesn’t seem to be helping. Have you noticed any coughing, chest pain, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Coughin’? Not really. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothin’ serious. Chest pain… no. Thank goodness. Swelling… hmm. My ankles do feel a little… puffy sometimes, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just from standin’ around all day, even when I can work. Is that bad? Don't tell me I'm gonna need one of those fancy machines to pump the water outta me.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy ankles are good to know. It's helpful information. Let's do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just try not to poke too much, eh? Old bones, you know. They don't take kindly to bein' prodded. What exactly are you lookin' for? Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Not at all, just a quick listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll check your throat and look at your ankles. Shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. First, let's listen to your breathing. Just breathe normally, in and out. Okay. A little bit of wheezing on both sides, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, a bit of a murmur, which is common at your age. Throat looks a little dry, some mild redness. And yes, I can feel some slight swelling in your ankles. Okay, Oreste. Based on what you've told me and what I've found, it sounds like we need to check a few things. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out dehydration and kidney function, and a chest X-ray to see what's going on with your lungs. Do that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… X-ray… Sounds serious. Kidney function? What does that mean? Is somethin’ wrong with my kidneys? I been drinkin' plenty of water! And X-ray… will that show if I’m… you know… gettin' old inside? I don't like the sound of this at all. Can't we just… take somethin' for the dry mouth? Maybe a good cough syrup?
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths, Oreste. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. These tests are just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Kidney function tests will help us see how well your kidneys are working to filter your blood. It's common for kidney function to change as we get older, and the tests just give us a baseline. The chest X-ray will help us see if there's anything causing the shortness of breath and wheezing. It's a routine scan and doesn't mean anything is definitely wrong. And yes, we can certainly address the dry mouth in the meantime. I can recommend a special mouthwash and artificial saliva to help with that. But it's important to find the cause of the dryness, and that's what the tests will help us with. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Mouthwash… that sounds alright. Artificial… what-you-call-it. Fine. But all this pokin' and proddin'… and tests… It’s just a lot. You really think somethin’s wrong? I just thought it was the heat. And bein' old. Is it gonna be expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. Medicare covers some things, right? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Oreste. It’s good you’re asking these questions. It’s not necessarily that something is wrong, but we want to rule out anything serious and make sure we're giving you the best possible care. We’re being thorough. Medicare should cover most of these tests, but we have staff who can verify your coverage and help with any potential costs. I’ll have them check that for you before you leave. As for the cost of the mouthwash and artificial saliva, they're relatively inexpensive. I'll write you a prescription and they can check the price at the pharmacy for you. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Medicare checkin’… that’s good. That's very good. I appreciate that. And cheap mouthwash… that's even better. It’s just… gettin' old is hard. Everything hurts, everything’s dry, and now I gotta go get poked and prodded. Alright, alright. Let’s get it over with then. What do I need to do for these tests? Do I need to fast? And where do I go?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Oreste. It is hard getting older. We're here to help you navigate it. For the blood work, you do need to fast for about 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water. You’ll go to the lab down the hall – the front desk will give you a lab slip. The X-ray is right across the street, and you don’t need to fast for that. Again, the front desk will give you the necessary paperwork. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Fastin’… lab slip… X-ray. Alright. I guess I'll go sit down and think about not eatin' for twelve hours. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… patient with an old man. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Oreste. It's my job. Don’t hesitate to ask the front desk if you have any questions at all. And please, come back and see me once you’ve had the tests done so we can discuss the results. Take care, and try not to worry too much.
