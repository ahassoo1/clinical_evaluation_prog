DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have all day, okay? It's... this tiredness. Just so tired. And... I keep wanting to eat dirt. Sounds crazy, I know. But it's happening. It's been worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and… a craving for dirt. Let’s try to unpack this a bit. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really remember when exactly. A while ago. Months, maybe? Time kinda…blurs together, you know? It just got worse and worse, that's all. I used to be able to push through, but now… forget it. I just wanna sleep all the time. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, months of increasing tiredness. And the dirt craving… has that been happening for months as well, or is that more recent?
PATIENT: Ugh, same time, I think. Everything just kinda...started at once. It's hard to say. Don't ask me for dates, I won't know. It's just…weird. I feel silly even talking about it. Normal people don't eat dirt, right?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to discuss what you're experiencing, Ms. Cantoran. And cravings for non-food items, like dirt, can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. We need to figure out what's going on. Do you feel any other symptoms along with the tiredness and cravings?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… My stomach’s been a little off. Not sick, exactly, just… unsettled. And I get headaches. A lot of headaches. But everyone gets headaches, right? And, oh! My skin feels… dry. Really dry. Like sandpaper. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettled stomach, headaches, and dry skin. That’s helpful. Are the headaches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly in the afternoons. It’s like… a dull ache. Not a splitting migraine or anything, just… annoying. And makes it harder to focus, which I really don't need right now. Honestly, I just want it to stop. This is taking up my whole day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever gets this over with faster. Just…try to be quick about it, okay? I got things to do. Don't poke too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ugh, just a little… right there. Not really pain, more like… sensitive. And, yeah, when you push… it feels a bit bloated. Like I ate too much, but I haven't. Honestly, my whole body feels off. Can we just skip the poking and get to figuring out what's wrong? I don’t have time for all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, some abdominal sensitivity and bloating. Let's take a look at your skin. I notice it is quite dry, as you mentioned. Any rashes or changes in color?
PATIENT: No rashes. Just…dry. Really, really dry. I put lotion on, but it doesn’t even help for five minutes. My hands… they crack, you know? It's awful. See? This isn’t normal. I used to have nice hands.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Significant dryness and some cracking. Ms. Cantoran, have you had any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Changes in diet? Not really. I eat the same things, mostly. Beans, tortillas... whatever's on sale at the store. I haven't been able to afford much variety lately, if that's what you mean. Everything’s so expensive. I don’t think my food has anything to do with eating dirt. That's just…weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Nope. I don't take anything. Never have. I don’t like pills. They just make me feel worse. I used to, a long time ago, when my husband was sick, but… not anymore. Just me now. So no. No medications. Can we please get this over with? I’m starting to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Ugh. No. Never had any allergies. I’m an Aztec woman, we don't get allergies. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen is bad, but that's it. Nothing serious. Look, I told you, I don't have time for this. What's going on with the dirt eating? Is it something I need to worry about or not? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Based on what you’ve told me – the tiredness, the craving for dirt, the unsettled stomach, headaches, dry skin, and the fact that you’re not taking any medications – it's possible you have iron deficiency anemia. The dirt eating, which is called pica, can sometimes be a symptom of severe iron deficiency. However, it’s important to confirm this with blood tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a thyroid panel. We also need to rule out other possibilities. I'll also check your blood pressure and pulse, just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… of course. More poking. Fine. But you better be quick about it. And... what's "iron deficiency anemia"? Is it serious? And can it be fixed? I don't have time for a long illness. Seriously. My hands are shaking. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a bit low, 98/62, and your pulse is 72. We'll keep an eye on that. Iron deficiency anemia means your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells, and that's often due to a lack of iron. It can cause fatigue, weakness, headaches, and cravings for unusual things like dirt. It is treatable, usually with iron supplements. We'll get the blood tests done to confirm, and if it is anemia, we can start you on supplements right away. I'm also going to order a stool test to rule out any infections. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: Questions? Ugh. Just… how long until I get the results? I don’t wanna keep coming back here. And... will these supplements make me feel better? Because I'm tired. Really, really tired. And… will they stop the craving? I don’t want to be eating dirt forever. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. Can we just get this fixed? That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand. The blood test results should be back in about 3 to 5 business days. The stool test might take a little longer, about a week. If it is iron deficiency anemia, the supplements usually start to make you feel better within a few weeks, but it can take a couple of months to fully replenish your iron stores. And yes, they should help stop the craving as your iron levels improve. I'm going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin with iron, just to get you started. And I’ll have the nurse give you a handout with information about iron-rich foods to include in your diet. We’ll follow up as soon as the results are back and discuss the best course of action. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s all. Just… get the nurse. I need to go home. And honestly, I’m still feeling lightheaded. Please, just…get it over with. I’ve wasted a whole day here. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She'll come in shortly to draw your blood and give you the handout. Please, if you start feeling worse – more lightheaded, dizzy, or short of breath – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Cantoran. I hope you feel better soon.
