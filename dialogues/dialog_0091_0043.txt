DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It’s good to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having this headache… right in the back of my head. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it just… won't quite go away. Not a terrible pain, more like a constant pressure, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Percell. A constant pressure is a good way to describe it. And how long has this headache been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started… oh, maybe about three weeks ago? Around the middle of July, I reckon. It comes and goes, but it’s always there, even if it's just a little bit. It's funny, because I remember exactly what I was doing when it first started - I was helping my granddaughter with her garden. She wanted to plant tomatoes.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Percell, and a lovely memory. About three weeks, starting around mid-July. And you noticed it specifically while gardening with your granddaughter. Has anything, to your knowledge, made it better or worse since then?
PATIENT: Well, nothing really makes it better, to be honest. I've tried some over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen kind, but they don't do much. As for worse... hmm. Thinking about it, it feels a little bit sharper when I get stressed. Work's been busy lately, lots of folks worried about their savings with everything going on in the world.
DOCTOR: I see. So the ibuprofen isn't providing significant relief, and stress seems to exacerbate the pain. Can you describe the location of the headache a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: It's right at the base of my skull, Doctor. Right where your neck meets your head. Sometimes it feels like it's radiating outwards, a little bit on both sides, but mostly it's right there. And it's not a throbbing pain, more like… a tight band squeezing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Percell. A tight band sensation at the base of your skull, radiating outwards. And no throbbing. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. I haven’t been sick to my stomach or anything like that. My vision’s been fine, I think. Oh! Now that you mention it… sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, especially in the morning. But I figured that was just from sleeping wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, dizziness, nausea, or visual disturbances. Neck stiffness, particularly in the morning. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your arms or hands?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no numbness or tingling. Everything feels normal there. I can move my arms and hands just fine. I do a lot of woodworking, you know, so I need to be able to use them properly. Still good! I've noticed I sleep pretty well too, for an old man. Maybe a little restless sometimes, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your hand function, Percell. And that you're sleeping reasonably well. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control for years now, thanks to some medication. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn't bother me too much. And I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was ages ago. Oh, and I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. It healed up alright, but sometimes it aches when the weather changes. I've been pretty lucky overall, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Percell. Controlled hypertension, arthritis in the knees, appendectomy, and a previous wrist fracture. Are you currently taking any medications for your hypertension or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, I take lisinopril for the blood pressure. Just one pill a day. And for the arthritis, I used to take something, but the doctor took me off of it a few years back, said it wasn't helping much and had too many side effects. So, just the lisinopril now. I try to stay active, that seems to help the knees more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Just lisinopril, one pill daily. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life, and never had a problem. I've never had a reaction to any medication either. I'm pretty fortunate that way, I think. Though, my wife used to be allergic to bee stings, but she's... well, she passed away a few years ago. So, not a concern anymore.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Percell. It sounds like you and your wife had a long life together. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a long time ago, but I still miss her. As for family history… hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And her mother, my grandmother, she had some kind of heart trouble, I think. My father, he was a healthy man, lived to be quite old, but I don’t recall any major illnesses. My sister, she had cancer a few years back, but she recovered, thankfully. We’re a pretty sturdy bunch overall, but there’s always something, isn't there?
DOCTOR: Yes, there often is. So, a family history of hypertension, heart trouble, and cancer. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. I’m retired now, used to be a financial advisor. Lots of numbers, lots of meetings. I live alone, have since my wife passed. I have three grown children, they live nearby, thankfully. See them pretty often. I enjoy woodworking in my spare time, building things for my grandkids. And I like to garden, of course. Keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble! I don't drink alcohol, never really liked it. And I don't smoke, haven't touched a cigarette in my life. Pretty simple life, all in all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Percell. That gives me a good overview of your background. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly assess your neurological function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I'm used to poking and prodding, had enough of it in my years. Just let me know if anything feels strange, okay?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Percell. Your blood pressure is 140/85, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lung sounds are clear. Your reflexes are intact and strength is normal in all extremities. I also palpated your neck muscles, and they do feel somewhat tense, especially in the posterior region. And I noticed some mild tenderness when I gently press along the base of your skull. Based on your history and this preliminary examination, it appears you may be experiencing tension headaches, likely exacerbated by stress. However, given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any other underlying causes. We'll check a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood work sounds like a good idea, just to be on the safe side. I appreciate you being thorough. I’d rather know for sure, you know? So yes, please go ahead and order those tests. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It’s good to know someone is looking out for an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Percell. It’s my pleasure. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood samples now. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to manage your stress levels as best as you can. Gentle exercise, relaxation techniques, and spending time with loved ones can all be helpful. I also want to emphasize that if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, dizziness, visual disturbances, or severe headache – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel much better knowing we’re getting things checked out. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I think I’m ready for the blood draw now, if you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab technician is ready for you, just down the hall to your left. They will take excellent care of you. Once you've completed the blood draw, please return to the waiting room, and I will review the results with you as soon as they are available. Thank you, Percell. I'll see you shortly.
