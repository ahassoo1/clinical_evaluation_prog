DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t usually do this sort of thing, visiting doctors. But my daughter… she insisted. She says I haven’t been myself lately. I… well, I’ve been feeling quite low, if I’m to be frank. It's been going on for a bit now, and I just want to get it sorted, really. I haven’t much time to be dwelling on things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. It’s good that you’re here, and it's very common for daughters to encourage their mothers to seek medical attention when they notice changes. Feeling “low” can mean a lot of things, so let's try to pinpoint what you’re experiencing. When you say you haven't been yourself, could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a difficult question. It’s not as though I’ve suddenly started wearing bright colours or anything. It’s more… a lack of interest, I think. In everything. My garden, which I usually adore, feels like a chore. Even seeing my grandchildren… it doesn't bring me the same joy. And I find myself… tired. Very tired. Not just physically, but… inside. Does that make any sense? I used to be so… active. Ski patrol, lifeguarding… kept me going for years. Now, I just… exist.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Derasmo. A loss of interest and feeling fatigued, even when you haven't been physically exerting yourself, is definitely something we should investigate. It's good you're able to articulate that so clearly. You mentioned this has been going on for a bit now. Can you tell me roughly how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it escapes me these days. I’d say… perhaps six months, maybe a little longer? It started gradually, just a little less enthusiasm for things. I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it’s… worsened. Especially in the last three months, I think. It’s becoming… difficult to cope. It’s not crippling, mind you. I still manage. But it takes… effort. A great deal of effort. And I don’t know how long I can keep that up.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, worsening over the last three. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this loss of interest and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me see… changes. Well, my appetite hasn’t been the best. I don’t feel hungry, not like I used to. I’m not losing weight, not drastically, but I’m certainly not eating as much. And… I haven’t been sleeping properly. I fall asleep alright, but I wake up frequently. Sometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes very early in the morning, and I just… lie there. Thinking. Or not thinking. Just… being awake. It’s frustrating, truly. And… I'm a bit more irritable, perhaps. My daughter says so, anyway. She’s very observant, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, disrupted sleep, and increased irritability. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of changes. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've always been a… strong person. I prided myself on it, really. I’ve broken a bone or two in my time – skiing mishaps, mostly – but nothing… serious. Nothing like this. My mother… she suffered from a weak heart, but I haven't inherited that, thankfully. I’ve never needed to see a psychiatrist or therapist. This is… new territory for me. And frankly, I’m not entirely comfortable with it. I just want to get to the bottom of it and be done, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Derasmo. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. It's good to know you haven't had any previous mental health diagnoses. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual things, Doctor. I take a multivitamin, a little something for my joints – the skiing, you know – and occasionally, paracetamol for headaches. Nothing regularly, nothing for anything serious. My blood pressure is usually quite good, so I don’t take anything for that. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. It’s just… harder now. Everything feels like a chore, even taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin, joint supplement, and occasional paracetamol. Thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I'm fairly robust, generally speaking. Though, perhaps not as robust as I used to be. It’s… disheartening to admit that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, let's briefly talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – experienced any mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult one. My mother… she was a very private woman. Didn’t discuss things much. My father… he was a stoic. Kept everything bottled up. As far as I know, no. No one openly suffered from anything like that. My siblings… well, they’re all quite… practical people. Not prone to dwelling on things, if you understand what I mean. My daughter… she's a bit more sensitive, perhaps. But she's always been a worrier. I don’t know if that counts. It’s not… the same, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know, even if the information is limited. And no, a general tendency to worry isn’t quite the same. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Not me. Never have, never will. My mother always said it was a waste of good money, and I’ve always agreed with her. And smoking… it’s dreadful for the lungs, you know. I need my lungs for skiing! I consider myself very… moderate in all things. Perhaps too moderate, these days. It’s just… everything feels like an effort. Even enjoying a cup of tea feels… laborious. It's silly, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like you’ve been a very conscientious person your whole life. Okay, one last quick set of questions. Are there any significant stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Stressors… Hmm. Not really, not in the traditional sense. I’m divorced, yes, but that was… a long time ago. The children are grown, healthy, and doing well. Financially, I’m comfortable. I live alone, but I have a lovely garden, and I enjoy the occasional ski trip. I suppose… the biggest stressor is… this. Feeling this way. It’s unsettling. It’s… not me. And I don’t like it. I just want to get back to feeling normal, if that makes sense. I'm not used to needing anything from anyone, least of all a doctor. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like, despite a lack of obvious external stressors, you're experiencing significant internal distress. Okay. To summarize, you've been feeling low for about six months, with worsening symptoms over the last three. You've noticed a loss of interest in activities you previously enjoyed, fatigue, decreased appetite, disrupted sleep, and increased irritability. You have no significant past medical history, no allergies, and no family history of mental health conditions. You don't take any regular medications or use any substances. And, despite a comfortable life, you're experiencing significant internal distress. I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam and then discuss some potential next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… fine. A physical exam sounds sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of it, really. I just hope it’s not something… serious. And I’d appreciate it if you could be… efficient, if possible. I have a few commitments this afternoon, and I don't like to be kept waiting. Though, I understand you have other patients. Let’s get on with it, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. I understand your desire for efficiency. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. I'll also quickly check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or nodules. Finally, let’s take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. Within the normal range. Everything appears physically normal at this point, which doesn’t rule things out, but it's a good starting point. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, several possibilities come to mind. It could be a number of things, including adjustment disorder, a mood disorder like depression, or even a vitamin deficiency. We can rule some things out with blood tests. Would you be comfortable with a complete blood count and a vitamin D level?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Yes, I suppose. If it will help. Though I don’t particularly enjoy having blood taken. But if you think it’s necessary… Yes. Please, let's get it over with. The sooner we know something, the better. And if it's simply a vitamin deficiency… well, that would be a relief, wouldn’t it? Just… please be quick. And tell the phlebotomist I dislike needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. I’ll make a note to let the phlebotomist know your preference. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a vitamin D level, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test, just to be thorough. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take long. While we're waiting for the results, I'd also like to ask you a few more detailed questions about your mood and sleep patterns, using a standardized questionnaire. It’s called the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, or PHQ-9. It will help me assess the severity of your symptoms and determine if further evaluation or treatment is needed. Would you be willing to complete that now?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? Oh, very well. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I don't have a great deal of patience for… paperwork. But I understand you need information. Yes, let's get it over with. Just… please don’t make me write too much. My handwriting isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. It’s a fairly straightforward questionnaire, and I can help if you have any trouble. It’s mostly multiple-choice. Here you are. It asks about how often you’ve been bothered by different problems over the last two weeks. Just circle the answer that best describes your experience. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: There. Finished. Honestly, it felt like an interrogation. But I suppose you need all this information. It was… tedious, to say the least. Is that enough? Can we get the blood tests done now, please? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. Based on your responses, it appears you are experiencing moderate symptoms of depression. This, combined with what you’ve already told me, supports the possibility of a depressive disorder. However, it's important to remember that this is just one piece of the puzzle. We need to wait for the blood test results to rule out any underlying medical causes. I’ve already sent the order to the lab. They usually have fairly quick turnaround times. In the meantime, while we wait, would you be open to discussing some strategies for coping with your symptoms?
PATIENT: Coping strategies? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been coping for seventy-five years. I haven't exactly been sitting around wringing my hands. I just… want to feel like myself again. I don’t need advice on how to… breathe deeply or whatever it is people suggest. I need a solution. And quickly. Is there anything… anything at all… you can prescribe to make me feel better? Just something to… take the edge off? I have commitments, you know. Things to do. I can't simply sit around feeling… like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Derasmo, and your desire for a quick solution. It's admirable that you've been coping for so long. And you’re right, simply suggesting relaxation techniques isn’t enough. Regarding medication, it’s certainly an option we can consider. However, I would prefer to wait for the blood test results before prescribing anything. It’s important to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, such as a vitamin deficiency or thyroid problem, before starting any medication. Starting a medication without a proper diagnosis isn’t the best practice. That said, if the blood tests are normal, then medication could be a helpful part of your treatment plan. There are several antidepressants available that are generally well-tolerated and effective. We would discuss the risks and benefits of each option before making a decision. In the meantime, perhaps we could explore some short-term strategies to help you manage your symptoms while we wait for the results?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Short-term strategies. As long as they don’t involve any… new age nonsense. I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I need something… concrete. Something that will actually do something. Is there anything… anything at all… that doesn't involve sitting around meditating or talking about my feelings? I really must be going soon. I have a garden to tend, you know. And grandchildren to see. But I just haven't the energy at the moment.
DOCTOR: I understand. Something concrete and practical. How about focusing on small, achievable goals?
PATIENT: Small, achievable goals? What does that entail, exactly? Making my bed? Watering a plant? Honestly, Doctor, I've been managing a household and raising children for decades. I don't need a lesson in basic self-care. I need something… more substantial. Something that will actually lift my spirits. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, that is not too much to ask at all. And you are absolutely right. Making your bed isn't the solution. I apologize; that was insensitive. When we talk about small goals, I meant breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. For example, you mentioned having a garden to tend. Perhaps instead of trying to tackle the entire garden at once, you could focus on weeding one flower bed. Or pruning one bush. Something that feels achievable without being overwhelming. The idea is to give you a small sense of accomplishment and start to rebuild your energy and motivation. It's about finding something that you enjoy, even if it's just a little bit. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Well… that does sound… less ridiculous than making my bed. Pruning one bush. I suppose I could manage that. I do enjoy the roses. They need a good trimming, actually. Alright. Yes. I’ll try pruning one bush. But if it doesn’t lift my spirits, I’m holding you personally responsible, Doctor. Now, are those blood test results back yet? I really must be going. I have a rose bush to attend to.
DOCTOR: Excellent. They just came back. All results are within normal limits. Complete blood count is normal, vitamin D levels are adequate, and thyroid function is normal. That rules out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. This means that your symptoms are most likely due to a mood disorder, such as depression. Given your PHQ-9 score and your reported symptoms, I would recommend starting a trial of an antidepressant medication. There are several options available, and we can discuss which one might be the best fit for you. We can also talk about the potential side effects and how to manage them. Would you be open to discussing medication options?
PATIENT: Oh… medication. Well, I suppose if you’ve ruled everything else out… Alright. Yes. Let's talk about medication. But I warn you, Doctor, I don't want anything that will turn me into a zombie. I still have a garden to tend and grandchildren to see. And I certainly don't want to lose my appetite. I may not be eating much at the moment, but I still enjoy a good meal. Tell me… what are my options? And what are the… drawbacks? I want to know everything before I agree to anything. I’m a practical woman, remember? I need to be informed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Derasmo. You deserve to be fully informed. And I understand your concerns; wanting to remain yourself and maintain your quality of life is paramount. There are several antidepressants available, and they work by balancing certain chemicals in the brain. One common class is called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs. These are generally well-tolerated and have fewer side effects than older medications. Examples include sertraline, escitalopram, and fluoxetine. Another option is bupropion, which works differently and can sometimes be helpful if you’re concerned about appetite suppression. Common side effects of SSRIs can include nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. However, these side effects are often mild and temporary, and they can often be managed with adjustments to the dosage or switching to a different medication. Bupropion can sometimes cause anxiety or insomnia. I would recommend starting with a low dose of sertraline. It’s generally well-tolerated, and it has a relatively low risk of side effects. We can then gradually increase the dosage until you start to feel better. It’s important to remember that it can take several weeks to see the full effects of an antidepressant. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies or medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. And no significant medical conditions. My blood pressure is usually quite good, as I mentioned earlier. I may have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age. I also take a multivitamin, just to keep things ticking over. Arthritis… that might be a concern, wouldn’t it? Will this medication interact with my joints? I don’t want to end up even more stiff and achy than I already am. And… what about driving? I still enjoy a good drive, you know. Will this medication make me drowsy? I don’t want to be a hazard on the road. I’m a careful driver, and I don’t want to risk an accident.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Derasmo. Let's address them one by one. Sertraline is not known to worsen arthritis symptoms and does not typically interact with arthritis medications. However, it's always a good idea to inform your pharmacist about all the medications you're taking, just to be safe. Regarding driving, sertraline can sometimes cause drowsiness, but it's usually mild and temporary. It's important to be aware of this potential side effect and to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you. We would start you on a low dose to minimize this risk. It’s also important to avoid alcohol while taking sertraline, as it can increase drowsiness and other side effects. Before we proceed, I want to make sure you understand the potential risks and benefits of sertraline. It’s important to remember that it’s not a magic bullet, and it may take several weeks to see the full effects. It’s also important to be patient and to communicate with me if you experience any side effects. Are you comfortable proceeding with a trial of sertraline?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A trial of sertraline. I suppose if you’ve explained everything so thoroughly… and if it might actually help me feel like myself again… Alright. Yes. Let’s try it. But I warn you, Doctor, if I start feeling worse, or if I end up stiff and achy and unable to drive, I’m holding you personally responsible. And if it makes me gain weight… well, that’s a discussion for another day. Now, how much of this… sertraline… do I need to take? And when? I need clear instructions. I’m a practical woman, remember? I need to know exactly what I’m getting myself into.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Derasmo. Clear instructions are essential. I’m prescribing you sertraline 25 milligrams, one tablet by mouth daily. Take it at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. You can take it with or without food. It’s important to be consistent with the dosage and to take it as prescribed. It may take several weeks to see the full effects of sertraline. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t feel better right away. It’s also important to continue any other treatments you’re receiving, such as therapy or exercise. Common side effects of sertraline can include nausea, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. If you experience any side effects, please let me know. We can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication if necessary. I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. During that appointment, we can discuss your symptoms and any side effects you’re experiencing. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Twenty-five milligrams, one tablet daily, in the morning. With or without food. And a follow-up appointment in two weeks. Yes. I think I’ve got it. No, I don't think I have any more questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a rose bush to attend to. And a feeling that I may need a strong cup of tea. Thank you, Doctor Bacy. I hope this… sertraline… actually works.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. I’m glad I could help. I have a good feeling that it will. And please, do enjoy your tea and your rose bush. If you experience any concerns at all before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a lovely day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. And… Doctor? Thank you for listening.
