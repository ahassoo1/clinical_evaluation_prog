DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Leander. Um… well, my ear feels… blocked. Like something’s stuffed in there, but there isn't anything. It's been bothering me for a bit now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It’s hard to say exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Leander. “Blocked” is a useful description. And you're right, it’s often difficult to pinpoint the exact onset of these things. To help me understand better, could you tell me a little more about this blockage?
PATIENT: More… how? Is it painful? Not really, no. Just… full. Like when you're on an airplane, you know? That pressure. But it hasn’t gone away. And it feels… muffled. Sounds are quiet, like someone turned down the volume. Is that… helpful? I don't know what details you need.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Leander. The pressure sensation and muffled hearing are certainly relevant. So, it’s not painful, but a feeling of fullness and decreased hearing in one or both ears?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Or… maybe it started in one and then went to the other? It's hard to say. Everything sounds… distant, really. And sometimes, when I swallow, it feels like something… pops? Not a loud pop, just a little click. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very clear. It's just… a vague feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Leander. Don't apologize at all. A vague feeling is still a feeling, and it’s important we address it. The sensation of a pop or click with swallowing is also noteworthy. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No fever, no dizziness. Not really any pain, like I said. I… I don’t think so. Oh! Wait. Now that you mention it, my hearing feels a little worse when it’s humid. Like today, actually. Is that… related? I garden, you see, so I’m outside a lot. Perhaps it's the moisture?
DOCTOR: That is potentially related, Leander. A change in hearing with humidity is certainly something we should consider, especially given your gardening. Let’s move through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any previous ear infections, or any issues with your hearing before today?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a boy, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Just… childhood stuff. And no, no problems with my hearing until… well, until this. I’ve always been able to hear just fine. My wife used to complain I heard too much, actually. Sorry. Didn’t mean to… get off track.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Leander. It’s perfectly alright. Childhood ear infections are quite common. And I appreciate you sharing that. Now, have you had any other significant medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about that, a few years back, I think. He put me on a little pill, but… I can't remember the name of it. I take it every day, I think. And no, nothing else. I’m… reasonably healthy, all things considered. I mostly just… work in the garden. It keeps me moving, at least. Do you need a list of medications? I'm not sure I have one handy.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know about the high blood pressure, Leander. The medication name isn’t critical at this moment, but if you happen to recall it later, please let me know. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any instances of hearing loss, ear problems, or similar issues within your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had trouble hearing in her later years, I believe. She always had the television turned up very loud. But I don't know if that was… just old age, or something else. My father, no. He had excellent hearing, right up until the end. To be honest, I don’t really… talk about family much. It's been a long time. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: That is perfectly okay, Leander. You are in no way obligated to share information you are not comfortable with. Your mother’s hearing loss is relevant, though, and we can proceed with that in mind. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never have. My wife… she used to, but she quit a long time ago. Before… well. No, I don’t smoke. And I don't drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on special occasions. I mostly drink water, especially when I'm gardening. It keeps me hydrated, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Leander. And thank you for sharing that. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re agreeable. I’ll need to look in your ears with an otoscope, and I’ll also listen to your lungs. This will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I have… things to get back to. I don't want to be a bother. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Leander. I understand. Okay, let's start by looking in your ears. Please remain still. I observe some mild cerumen present, but no obvious signs of inflammation or infection. The tympanic membrane appears slightly dull. Similar findings here - mild cerumen, and a slightly dull tympanic membrane. Now, I’ll listen to your lungs. Please take some deep breaths in and out. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Alright, Leander. Based on the examination, I don’t see any immediate cause for concern like an acute infection. The dullness of your tympanic membranes could indicate a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum, which is consistent with your description of fullness and muffled hearing. It’s also possible that the cerumen is contributing to the blockage.
PATIENT: Fluid… behind the eardrum? Is that… serious? What does that mean? And what about the cerumen? Can you just… take it out? I don’t want to have anything… complicated. I just want to be able to hear again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Leander. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. Fluid behind the eardrum can have several causes, most commonly a mild upper respiratory infection or allergies. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it can certainly be bothersome and affect your hearing. Regarding the cerumen – yes, we can certainly remove it. It’s a common procedure and usually provides immediate relief if the earwax is contributing to the blockage. I can perform a cerumen impaction removal using irrigation, or manually if needed. It’s generally quite comfortable. However, before proceeding with the cerumen removal, I would like to perform a tympanometry test. This is a quick, painless test that measures the movement of your eardrum and helps me confirm if there is fluid present and assess the function of your middle ear. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A test… another test. Honestly, Doctor, I really just want this fixed. But… alright. If it will help, then yes. Do it. Just… please be quick about it. And tell me what it involves. I don’t like surprises. What exactly will you do?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Leander, and I assure you I’ll do my best to be as efficient as possible. The tympanometry test is very straightforward. I’ll gently insert a small probe into your ear canal – it doesn’t go in very far – and it will create a slight puff of air. It feels like a little tickle or a subtle pressure change in your ear. It takes less than a minute per ear. Alright, Leander. Let's start with your right ear. Just try to remain still and quiet during the test. Okay, the results show reduced tympanic membrane mobility in both ears, which supports the presence of fluid in the middle ear. This is consistent with your symptoms and our examination findings. It doesn't appear to be a severe build-up, but it is enough to cause the muffled hearing and fullness you're experiencing. Based on these findings, I recommend we proceed with cerumen removal in both ears, followed by observation. Often, removing the earwax will allow any remaining fluid to drain on its own. If your symptoms persist after cerumen removal, we may need to consider further evaluation, such as a hearing test or referral to an audiologist. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Cerumen removal… alright. Yes, let’s just get it done then. Please, just be careful. I don’t want anything… poking around in there too much. I’ve always had sensitive ears. And if it doesn’t work… well, I suppose we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Just… hurry, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Leander. I understand your apprehension, and I assure you I’ll be as gentle as possible. I will use a careful technique to remove the cerumen and minimize any discomfort. "I’m going to use a warm water solution to gently flush out the earwax. You might feel some slight pressure or a bubbling sensation in your ear. If you feel any pain or discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately, and I will stop the procedure." Okay, the cerumen has been successfully removed from both ears. Your ear canals appear clear now. I’m going to give you a prescription for some over-the-counter decongestant nasal spray, which can help to reduce any congestion in your Eustachian tubes and promote drainage. I would like you to use the nasal spray as directed for the next week, and then follow up with me in one week to assess your hearing. If your symptoms haven’t improved after a week, or if they worsen, please schedule an appointment with an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A week… alright. A week isn’t too bad. And nasal spray… yes, I can manage that. So, no more poking around in there, hopefully? Just the spray? And if it doesn’t work… what happens then? An audiologist… what is that? I really just want to hear normally again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, no more poking around, hopefully. Just the nasal spray for now, and we’ll reassess in a week. And you're right, hearing normally again isn’t too much to ask at all. An audiologist is a healthcare professional who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of hearing and balance disorders. They can perform a comprehensive hearing test to determine the exact nature and extent of your hearing loss, and recommend appropriate treatment options, such as hearing aids or other assistive listening devices. It’s important to remember that this initial approach often resolves the issue, especially if the fluid build-up is mild. However, if your symptoms persist, seeing an audiologist will provide valuable information and allow us to develop a more tailored treatment plan. I’m optimistic that the cerumen removal and decongestant nasal spray will provide relief. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here is a printout of the aftercare instructions, and the prescription for the nasal spray. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I’m not very good with… all of this. Just… try not to let it get worse. I should probably get going. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. It was my pleasure. And please, don't worry about not being "good with all of this." It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and I’m here to help in any way I can. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a week. .
PATIENT: .
