DOCTOR: Good morning, Liza. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking lately about… trying to find a little more peace, I suppose. I’m interested in learning about mindfulness or meditation. I’ve heard good things, but I don’t really know where to start, or even if it’s right for me.
DOCTOR: That's a really good question, Liza, and it’s great you’re thinking about your well-being. Mindfulness and meditation can be very helpful. It's fantastic you're exploring options for feeling more at peace. To get a better idea of what might be useful for you, could you tell me a little more about what's been on your mind lately?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s not any one big thing, really. Just… life, I guess. Work is… work. I repair signals and track switches, you know? It can be stressful, making sure everything’s safe. And then there’s just… the general worry of things. Being alone, I suppose. Not lonely, exactly, but… aware of it. It all just builds up sometimes. Does that make sense? I find myself thinking too much, replaying things, worrying about things that haven't happened.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Liza. That sounds like a lot to carry – the responsibility at work, and those feelings of being alone, even if it's not loneliness. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed by those thoughts and worries. Replaying things and anticipating problems is something a lot of people experience. Before we focus on mindfulness specifically, I just want to make sure we're covering all bases. Have you felt this way for a long time, or is this a more recent development?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s probably been… building for a few years, if I’m honest. But it’s definitely gotten more noticeable in the last six months or so. I used to be able to just… switch off, I suppose. Distract myself with things. But it feels harder now. The thoughts just… stick around. It's not constant, mind you. There are good days, and then… others.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A gradual increase over time is important information. And it’s good you can identify times when you feel better – that suggests this isn't all-consuming. Just to get a broader picture, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with these thoughts?
PATIENT: Symptoms… like physical things? Let me think. Well, I have been sleeping a little less well, maybe. Not waking up in the night, but just… taking longer to fall asleep. And I’ve noticed I get a bit more easily irritated, I think. Snapping at people over small things. I don't usually do that. And… oh, sometimes my stomach feels a bit… unsettled. Not painful, exactly, just… uneasy. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. Those are all things that can be connected to stress and worry. Difficulty sleeping, irritability, and stomach upset are all common. Now, just to rule things out, do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Nothing major, thankfully. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was all straightforward, and I’ve been fine since. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, from all the work, but it’s well-managed with some over-the-counter pain relief. Other than that… no, not really. I’m generally quite healthy, I think. Medicare keeps a close eye on me, you know. They’re very thorough.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Liza. No major concerns there. And it's helpful to hear that you're generally healthy. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones besides the pain relief for your hands?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen for my hands, when I need it. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take paracetamol. That’s it, really. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. My mother always said, “A little bit of fresh air fixes most things!” She was a very sensible woman. And… oh, I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because we don’t get much sun here, you know? But that’s it. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Just vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen and paracetamol. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. My grandmother was Bulgarian, you know, and they eat… everything! Lots of yoghurt and cheeses and… well, everything! I’ve always had a strong stomach, thankfully. No allergies to speak of. Though I do prefer loose-leaf tea to tea bags, if that counts!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Liza. No known allergies. And a preference for loose-leaf tea is perfectly acceptable! Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social support system?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit of a tricky one. I don't have any close family nearby, sadly. My brother lives in Sofia, but we don’t see each other very often. I have a few work colleagues I get along with, but it’s not the same, you know? It’s more… practical. We help each other out with work stuff. And I have a neighbour, Mrs. Petrov, who is lovely. We have a cup of tea together sometimes. But… I suppose it’s fair to say I’m mostly on my own. Not unhappy, just… independent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Liza. It sounds like you have some connections, which is good, but you also have a lot of independence, and that’s perfectly okay. It's important to acknowledge both. Okay. So, to summarise, you've been experiencing increasing worries and thoughts over the last six months, with some difficulty sleeping, irritability, and stomach upset. You have a history of gallbladder removal ten years ago and arthritis in your hands, well-managed with over-the-counter pain relief. You take vitamin D supplements in winter and occasionally ibuprofen or paracetamol. No known allergies. And you have some social connections but generally live independently. Given everything you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of stress and anxiety. It's not necessarily a formal diagnosis at this point, but it's something we should explore. Would you be open to me doing a quick physical exam just to rule out anything else contributing to these symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I'm happy to have a quick check-up. I mean, if it puts my mind at ease, then absolutely. I’ve never been one to shy away from a good check-up. My mother always said, “Prevention is better than cure!” She was right about most things. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Pulse is normal. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing is good. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses or abnormalities detected. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems physically normal, Liza. Which, in your case, is very reassuring. It supports what I was thinking – that these symptoms are likely related to stress and anxiety.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear, Doctor. Honestly, I’m relieved. I was worried there might be something… sinister. I mean, you never know, do you? But if it’s just stress, then… well, that feels manageable. What do you think I should do about it? Is that mindfulness stuff a good idea, do you think? And is there anything else I can do? I’m willing to try anything, really. I just want to feel… calmer.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to worry, Liza, and it’s good that you came in to get it checked out. It’s excellent that you're proactive. Yes, I absolutely think mindfulness and meditation could be beneficial for you. It's a fantastic way to learn to manage those racing thoughts and reduce stress. There are lots of resources available, including apps, online courses, and local classes. I can give you some information on those later. However, given your social situation and the fact that you've been experiencing this for a while, I would also suggest considering some talking therapy alongside mindfulness. Sometimes, it helps to have someone to talk things through with. I can refer you to a counsellor if you'd like. In the meantime, are you getting regular exercise?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good idea, Doctor. Talking to someone… I hadn’t really thought about that. Maybe that would help. Yes, please, if you could refer me to a counsellor, that would be lovely. And exercise… well, I used to walk more, but I’ve been a bit… sluggish lately, to be honest. Work is quite physical, but it’s not the same, you know? It’s more… focused. I don’t really get the chance to just… wander and think. Or not think, for that matter! I suppose I should try to make more time for it. What kind of exercise do you recommend? Something gentle, I think. I’m not exactly a marathon runner!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, something gentle is perfect. Walking is a fantastic starting point, even just a 20-30 minute walk a few times a week. Yoga or tai chi can also be very beneficial, as they combine physical activity with mindfulness and breathing exercises. The important thing is to find something you enjoy, so it doesn't feel like a chore. Okay, so let's summarise our plan. I'm going to refer you to a counsellor who specialises in anxiety and stress management. I'll also give you some information on local mindfulness resources and gentle exercise options. We can review your progress at a follow-up appointment in about a month. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. Really, thank you. I feel much better already, just talking it through. A counsellor, mindfulness, and a bit more walking… it feels manageable. A month sounds good for a follow-up. I can write things down, if that helps. I’m quite organised, you see. Always have been. Do you have any brochures or leaflets I can take with me? And perhaps the counsellor’s contact details?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are some leaflets on mindfulness and stress management techniques. This one has some local walking groups listed. And here's the referral form for the counsellor. I’ve already filled in my details. You just need to complete your contact information and they will get in touch to arrange an appointment. I’ve also written down the website address for a really helpful app called “Headspace” – it’s a guided meditation app. Just remember, Liza, these things take time and effort. Be patient with yourself, and don’t be afraid to reach out if you’re struggling. I’m here to support you. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. I feel much more hopeful now. Thank you again. I’ll definitely take a look at that app, and I'll get the referral form sent off as soon as I get home. And I’ll try to remember to walk more! Perhaps Mrs. Petrov would like to join me? That would be nice. Thank you once more. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. That’s a wonderful idea about walking with Mrs. Petrov – social support is so important. And remember, small steps are all that matter. You have a good day too, and please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: .
