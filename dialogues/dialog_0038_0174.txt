DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. I’m Dr. Auelua. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain, really. Just a general feeling of being down, I suppose. I haven’t much patience for long stories, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani, no long stories needed. “Feeling down” can mean a lot of things. Could you tell me a little bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… a lack of joy, I think. Things that used to please me… don’t. I used to love my garden, my volunteer work with the children… now, it feels like a chore. And I sleep… too much, or not enough. It's quite bothersome, to be honest. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds really frustrating, wanting to enjoy things and just not being able to. And the sleep changes certainly add to that. Has this been going on for a long time, or is it something more recent?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been creeping up on me, I’d say. Perhaps… six months now? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. At first, I just thought I was tired from work. You know, lifeguarding takes it out of you, even at my age. But it hasn’t gotten better, and now… well, now it's just wearing me down. I don’t feel like myself. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Six months is a good while. And it's good you recognize it's not just tiredness from work. Besides the loss of joy and sleep changes, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don’t eat at all. Other days I eat… too much comfort food. Chocolate, mostly. And yes, I believe I have gained a little weight. Not much, but enough to notice in my clothes. I try to keep active, but it’s harder when you don’t feel like it, you understand. It's a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Nani. It sounds like you’re caught in a difficult cycle. Have you been feeling more anxious or irritable lately, or perhaps having trouble concentrating?
PATIENT: Irritable, yes. My grandchildren say I’ve been… “short” with them. Which is dreadful. I adore those children. Concentrating… not so much. I used to read for hours, now I can barely get through a chapter. And I find myself… forgetting things. Not important things, thankfully, but little things. Where I put my glasses, what I was going to say… It's annoying, really. I always prided myself on a good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a fuller picture, have you experienced any physical symptoms alongside these feelings?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I have been rather… achy, lately. My joints, mostly. I thought it was just the weather, to be honest. Old age, you know. But it’s… persistent. And sometimes I feel… a bit breathless, even when I haven’t been exerting myself. Nothing alarming, just… noticeable. I don't want to take up too much of your time with all my complaints, Doctor. It’s just… a lot, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much at all, Nani. It's good you're telling me everything. It helps me understand what’s going on. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. High blood pressure, yes. Diagnosed about fifteen years ago. I take medication for it, as prescribed. Otherwise… no, nothing else. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, Doctor. I’ve always been a fairly healthy woman, all things considered. Ski patrol keeps you fit, you know. Though admittedly, it's been a few seasons since I've been up on the slopes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just a hysterectomy, many years ago. And a knee operation, after a fall skiing. That was… twenty years ago, perhaps? It healed well enough, though it does ache in cold weather. I haven’t had any other surgeries, Doctor. I try to avoid them if possible. Too risky at my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like depression, anxiety, heart disease, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she suffered from what the doctor called “nervous exhaustion” when I was a child. Spent some time in a… a home. It wasn't spoken about much. My father… healthy as an ox, he was. No real problems. And my siblings… well, my sister has arthritis, and my brother… he had heart trouble later in life. That’s about it, I think. It's hard to remember everything, you understand. Things fade with age.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nani. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I only have a small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps two, on special occasions. I do not partake in… recreational drugs, Doctor. I always believed in a healthy lifestyle. Moderation in all things, that was my motto. Though admittedly, I haven’t been very good at moderating the chocolate lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve taken various medications over the years for minor ailments – antihistamines, pain relievers – and never had any problems. I’m not allergic to anything, Doctor. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. Is that all the questions? I must admit, this has been rather… exhaustive. I appreciate you listening, though. It’s good to get it all off my chest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the questions for now, Nani. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. It really does help. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A quick exam is fine. Just… please be gentle. My joints aren't what they used to be. And do try not to take too long, if you don't mind. I have a luncheon appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we won’t take long. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. Just… try not to scare me with all that equipment.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart rate is a little fast, but the rhythm is regular. Your lungs sound a little quiet at the bottom, which could be normal, or could be something we need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is also a little fast. Now I’m going to take a look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look good. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? My grip isn’t what it used to be, but it’s… reasonable. I used to be quite strong, you know. Ski patrol demands a certain amount of physical strength.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Nani. Your grip is a little weak, but not alarmingly so. Now, let's check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but again, that’s not uncommon at your age. Finally, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Everything sounds normal there. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, potentially complicated by some anxiety. Your sleep changes, loss of joy, weight gain, and fatigue are all consistent with that diagnosis. The slightly elevated blood pressure and fast pulse could be related to anxiety, or could indicate a need to better manage your hypertension. Your diminished reflexes and weak grip could be age-related, but we'll want to keep an eye on them. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Depression… I suppose that doesn’t surprise me, really. I’ve felt… out of sorts for so long. It's just… disheartening to hear it put into words. Anxiety, too? I hadn’t really thought of it that way. And my blood pressure… I’ve been meaning to get that checked more regularly. So, what does this mean? Will I need… medication? I’m not fond of taking pills, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about medication, Nani. It's completely reasonable to be concerned about that. The good news is that depression and anxiety are very treatable. The first step is to confirm the diagnosis with some questionnaires, just to be sure. Then, we can discuss the best course of action for you. Medication is often helpful, but it’s not the only option. Therapy – talking to a counselor or psychologist – can be very effective, either on its own or in combination with medication. Lifestyle changes, like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and better sleep hygiene, can also make a big difference. We can start with the questionnaires, and then we'll talk about your preferences and find a treatment plan that you’re comfortable with. We can also discuss your blood pressure and make sure it's well-managed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Questionnaires… alright. That sounds… manageable. I’d prefer to avoid medication if possible, but I’m willing to listen to your advice. Therapy… I suppose I could try that. I’ve never really spoken to anyone about my feelings before, but perhaps it would be helpful. And yes, please do help me with my blood pressure. I’ve been neglecting it lately, I admit. So, questionnaires first, then we talk? That sounds like a good plan, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Nani. I'm glad you're open to that. I’m going to ask you a series of questions, and please just answer as honestly as you can. There are no right or wrong answers. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Are you ready when I am?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Let's get it over with, then. The sooner we start, the sooner I can get back to… well, trying to enjoy my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First question: Over the last two weeks, have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Yes. Quite a bit, actually. Things that used to bring me joy… they don’t anymore. It feels… empty.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the last two weeks, have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Yes. Most days, actually. It's not a… crushing sadness, but a general feeling of… emptiness, like I said. Just a lack of… hopefulness. It’s difficult to explain. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the last two weeks, have you had trouble sleeping, or have you been sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Both, actually. Some nights I can't sleep at all, tossing and turning for hours. Other nights I just… sleep for too long. It’s very frustrating. I never used to have trouble sleeping.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the last two weeks, have you felt tired all the time, even after sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Constantly tired. Exhausted, really. It's… debilitating, to be honest. It makes it hard to do even the simplest things. I could sleep all day and still feel exhausted.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the last two weeks, have you had a poor appetite, or have you been eating too much?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Some days I have no appetite at all. Other days… well, I comfort eat, I suppose. Chocolate mostly. It's not healthy, I know, but it's… a temporary comfort.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the last two weeks, have you felt bad about yourself – or that you're a failure, or have let yourself or your family down?
PATIENT: Yes. Perhaps not a failure, exactly… but I do feel like I’m not living up to my potential. And I worry about my grandchildren… I want to be a good grandmother, but I haven’t been myself lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the last two weeks, have you had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It's very frustrating. I used to love reading, but now I can barely get through a chapter. My mind just wanders. I forget things easily, too.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the last two weeks, have you been moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I feel tired, but I don't believe anyone has commented on my movements or speech being slower. I try to keep up appearances, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, over the last two weeks, have you been thinking about death or suicide?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never. I have no thoughts of harming myself, Doctor. That's… a terrible question.
DOCTOR: I understand your reaction, Nani, and I apologize if that question was upsetting. It's a standard part of the screening process, and I ask it to ensure your safety. It's good to hear you're not having those thoughts. Based on your answers, it appears you have a moderate level of depression. It's not severe enough to require immediate hospitalization, but it’s definitely something we need to address. Now, I want to talk to you about some options for treatment. We can discuss medication, therapy, or a combination of both. Would you like to start by talking about therapy?
PATIENT: Therapy… yes. Let’s start with therapy. Medication… I’m still hesitant about that. Tell me about the therapy. What does it involve? What would I be talking about? And… is it confidential?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Nani. Therapy, in this case, would involve meeting with a licensed psychologist or counselor on a regular basis – usually once a week. It’s a safe and confidential space where you can talk about your feelings, thoughts, and experiences without judgment. There are different types of therapy, but the one I would recommend for you is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. It focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to your depression. So, you’d be talking about things like your loss of joy, your sleep changes, your fatigue, and any difficulties you’re experiencing in your relationships. We’d also work on developing coping mechanisms to manage your stress and anxiety. And yes, everything you discuss in therapy is completely confidential, with a few limited exceptions – such as if you’re a danger to yourself or others, or if I’m legally obligated to report something. But otherwise, your privacy is my top priority. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Changing negative thought patterns… that sounds… logical, actually. And confidential… that’s important. I’m not sure I’m ready to delve into all my personal feelings with just anyone. But a safe and confidential space… that sounds reassuring. So, you recommend this… CBT? How long would therapy last? And… how much would it cost? I have insurance, but I’m not sure what it covers.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Nani. CBT is very effective for depression, and many of my patients have found it incredibly helpful. The length of therapy can vary depending on your individual needs and progress, but typically, it lasts for about 12-20 sessions. We can start with a shorter course of therapy, and then reassess your progress and decide whether to continue. As for the cost, the standard fee for a 50-minute session with a licensed psychologist is $150. However, since you have private insurance, your out-of-pocket costs will likely be lower, depending on your deductible and co-pay. I have a billing specialist who can contact your insurance company to determine your specific coverage. Would you like me to have her reach out to them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Have her reach out to my insurance company. I’d like to know what my costs would be before I commit to anything. And… are you able to recommend a particular psychologist? Someone… experienced with patients my age? I wouldn’t want to feel like I’m bothering them with my… old people problems.
DOCTOR: “Old people problems”?
PATIENT: I didn’t mean… I just mean… my concerns might be different from younger patients. It's just that I've lived a long life and have a lot of… baggage.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nani. Life experience is valuable, and it’s perfectly normal to have unique concerns as you get older. I actually have a few excellent psychologists that I frequently recommend to patients your age. Dr. Eleanor Vance specializes in geriatric psychology, and she has a wonderful rapport with older adults. She’s very compassionate and understanding, and she’s experienced in addressing issues like loss, grief, and adjusting to changes in lifestyle. Would you like me to give you her contact information?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… perfect, actually. Geriatric psychology… that’s exactly what I need. I’d like her contact information, please. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little bit better just talking about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. I’m glad you’re feeling a little bit better. Here is Dr. Vance’s contact information: her number is 555-123-4567, and her office is located at 123 Main Street. She also has a website at www.drvancepsychology.com. I’m also going to write you a referral for therapy, just in case your insurance requires it. And I’ll have my billing specialist contact your insurance company to determine your coverage. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ll contact Dr. Vance and… see what she says. I suppose… I’ll see you again if I need to.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please, take care of yourself. It was lovely meeting you. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
