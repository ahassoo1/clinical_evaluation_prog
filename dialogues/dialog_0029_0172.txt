DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here. My husband insisted, you see. Something about… settling in? We just moved, and he worries so. It’s all rather tiresome, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Right, settling in. A check-up after a move is always a good idea. Your husband sounds like a caring man. Just to be thorough, even if you're not experiencing anything specific, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been feeling generally well otherwise?
PATIENT: Generally well enough, I suppose. Though my bones ache something fierce these days. It’s the weather, probably. Always has been. I don’t recall any… problems, as such. Though I do take a little something for my water. Helps with… well, you know. Women’s troubles.
DOCTOR: Okay, aches with the weather, and medication for… bladder control, it sounds like. We’ll definitely get to the aches. Just to be clear, what medication are you taking for that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name escapes me. A little white pill, I believe. I've been taking it for… oh, decades, probably. My previous doctor sorted it all out. I simply refill the prescription when it’s needed. Honestly, I don't bother with memorizing names. It’s all too much fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can try to look it up in your records. In the meantime, are there any other medications you take regularly?
PATIENT: Just the one, dear. And a little something for my blood pressure now and then, when it flares up. Again, I couldn’t tell you the name. A small blue one, I think? It’s all rather… blurry. My husband handles most of that these days. He has a much better memory than I do, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like we need to get a clearer picture of your medication list. I’m going to ask the nurse to check your insurance records and get a complete list from the pharmacy. It’s important to know exactly what you’re taking to avoid any interactions. Now, going back to those aches… where are they located, and how would you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tedious. I've told you, it's the weather. Always has been. But if you must know, they’re mostly in my hips and back. A dull ache, really. Nothing dramatic. Like…old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. And you are right, it could be the weather. However, aches in the hips and back, especially in someone your age, can be caused by a number of things. I just want to be thorough. Are these aches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, mostly. Worse in the damp, naturally. And when I’ve been sitting for too long. Though honestly, what isn’t worse when you've been sitting for too long at my age? It's simply… a fact of life. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Things ache.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Ms. Engelhaupt. And you’re absolutely right – aches and pains are common with age. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Oh, occasionally. In my toes, I think. Though it could be my slippers. They’re rather… snug. I’ve been meaning to get a new pair. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t think it’s anything serious. It's probably just… circulation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any recent falls, or any difficulty with your balance?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! I am perfectly steady on my feet. Though my husband does fuss about me being a little… unsteady sometimes. He worries excessively, you see. It’s probably just his imagination. I’ve never fallen, not seriously. A little stumble now and then, perhaps, but nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a few more questions, then we can talk about a plan. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, really! This is becoming quite personal. I… I don’t see what my bowel habits have to do with anything. I assure you, everything is perfectly… regular. I don’t wish to discuss this further.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was an uncomfortable question, Ms. Engelhaupt. It’s standard procedure to ask about such things to get a complete picture of your health. We can certainly move on. Now, lastly, have you had any recent unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, not intentionally. Though my appetite hasn't been what it used to be, I must admit. Everything just tastes… bland these days. But I haven't been trying to lose weight. Honestly, Doctor, I find this whole examination rather tiresome. I’m quite ready for it to be over, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’ve kept you longer than you’d like. Based on what you’ve told me, and given your recent move, I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. We can also do a brief physical exam to check your reflexes and range of motion. It's just a precaution, to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming a bit much. I suppose… if you insist. But I expect a quick turnaround. I haven't got all day. And please, no poking and prodding. Just the bare minimum, if you don’t mind. I’m a very delicate woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. We will keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. I'll have the nurse draw some blood now. Then, I’d like to just check your reflexes, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your hips and back. It shouldn't take long at all. Let’s start with the blood work, and then we can proceed from there. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. The sooner this is finished, the better. But I must warn you, I bruise very easily. And I don’t particularly like needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. The nurse will get started with the blood work now. Just relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. We'll be as gentle as possible. Please let me or the nurse know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all rather undignified.
DOCTOR: We're almost finished, Ms. Engelhaupt. Just a few more moments.
PATIENT: Honestly, the things one has to endure…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt, all done. Just keep pressure on that arm for a few minutes to prevent bruising. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. Would you mind standing up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please, be quick about it. My hip is acting up already. And don't expect me to do any fancy balancing acts. I’m not a circus performer, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, nothing fancy at all. Just a quick assessment. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me… in and out… good. Everything sounds clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: Honestly, this chair is terribly uncomfortable. And all this breathing…it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Just a quick tap… and another one… good. Your reflexes are present. Now, I’m going to briefly check your range of motion in your hips and back. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be gentle. Can you reach forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! I can barely bend over as it is. You’ll put my back out! I told you, I’m a delicate woman. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite painful.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to push it. That’s quite enough. It’s clear your range of motion is limited. I'm not going to force anything. Okay. Based on this quick examination, and what you've told me, I’m going to order those blood tests, as we discussed. We’ll check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and inflammation. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. As long as I don't have to endure any more poking and prodding. I expect a prompt turnaround on those tests. And if I don’t feel any better by then, I expect a referral to a specialist.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The results should be back within a week. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they are available. If you don’t feel any better, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact the office, and we will certainly consider a referral to a specialist. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Honestly, this entire ordeal has been rather… taxing. I’m quite ready to go home now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand. The nurse will escort you to the waiting room to schedule your follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Hmph. .
