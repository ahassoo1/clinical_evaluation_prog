DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It's good to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Honestly? My wife thought it was a good idea. She worries too much. I just… wanted to get checked for, you know… the HIV. Better safe than sorry, I guess. Though I can’t imagine where I’d even get it, living out here.
DOCTOR: I see. While it’s admirable your wife encourages preventative care, it’s important to have a valid reason for medical testing, rather than simply acting on… anxieties. However, we can certainly discuss HIV screening. To properly assess your risk, I’ll need to ask you a few questions. Have you had any recent… intimate contact with anyone other than your wife?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Is that what you’re getting at? Look, I’ve been married for ten years. Ten! And I’m not the type. This whole thing is… frankly a bit insulting. But fine, ask your questions. It’s just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. It is standard procedure to assess risk factors when considering an HIV test. It’s not a judgment of your character, simply a matter of responsible medical practice. And frankly, given your location, and the potential for… limited access to healthcare, a thorough assessment is even more crucial. To clarify – have you ever shared needles with anyone, even for non-medical purposes?
PATIENT: Needles? What kind of question is that? I live a perfectly normal life, Doctor. I don’t… do things like that. Honestly, you’re starting to make me feel like you think I’m some sort of… degenerate. I work hard, I provide for my family. I haven’t even seen a needle outside of the doctor’s office in… well, years. This is ridiculous. And a bit rude, frankly. I’m starting to regret coming in here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, I have no intention of making judgments. I am simply following protocol to ensure we are ordering the correct tests and providing you with appropriate care. However, if you are unwilling to answer basic questions regarding potential risk factors, it makes it difficult to proceed responsibly. Let's try a different approach. Have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? Goodness, no. Never. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Look, is this test even necessary? My wife is just… overly cautious. And you’re making this whole process incredibly unpleasant. I’m a perfectly respectable man, and I’m being treated like… I don’t know what. Just tell me if the test is going to happen or not. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. Given your insistence that you have no risk factors, and your… reluctance to provide a comprehensive history, I will order an HIV antibody test. However, I must strongly advise that a negative result in this situation is only meaningful if we have accurately assessed your risk. Before we proceed, let me document that you have declined to answer specific questions regarding potential exposures. Do you consent to that documentation in your chart?
PATIENT: Fine, document whatever you want. Honestly, the less I have to talk about this, the better. Just get it over with. I’m wasting my time here. Though, I expect a full refund if it’s negative, given how… unnecessary this whole thing is. And don’t you dare tell my wife I didn’t cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will proceed with the blood draw. The results typically take 7-10 business days. While we wait, I’ll also perform a basic physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. It's standard procedure, regardless of the reason for your visit. If you would please remove your shirt and shoes, and sit on the table, we can begin. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is ridiculous. A full physical? For a simple HIV test? My wife is going to be insufferable if she finds out I let you do all this. But fine, get it over with. Just… be quick about it, alright? I have better things to do than be poked and prodded. And don't go judging my physique, either. I work hard, but I haven’t got time for the gym.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is 72 and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are normal. Your weight is 65 kilograms and your height is 173 centimeters, giving you a BMI of 21.8, which is within the normal range. No visible signs of skin lesions or abnormalities. Overall, your general physical appearance is unremarkable. Everything appears normal, Mr. Belan, but these are just preliminary observations. We’ll have a more definitive assessment once the lab results are available.
PATIENT: Well, good. Glad to hear it. See? Perfectly healthy. I told you this was a waste of time. Now, can we just get the blood drawn and be done with this? The longer I’m here, the more annoyed I’m going to get. And honestly, the whole experience is making me feel… uncomfortable. I’m a respectable man, and I shouldn’t have to be subjected to all this scrutiny just because my wife worries too much. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The phlebotomist is ready for you just down the hall. They will collect the blood sample and send it to the lab. Once the results are available, we will contact you. Please take this with you. And Mr. Belan, while I respect your… insistence on your good health, preventative care is always advisable. I’ll see you again in approximately a week.
