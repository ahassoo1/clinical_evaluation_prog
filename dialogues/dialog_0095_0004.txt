DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Just in for my shots, really. Routine stuff, you know? I think I'm due for a few.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear, staying on top of things. Let me just pull up your record here… Alright, it looks like you are due for a tetanus booster and your annual flu shot. Have you had those this year already?
PATIENT: Nope, haven't had either one yet. That's why I made the appointment, to get 'em done before things get too crazy with the weather changing. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: Right, very sensible. And just to confirm, do you have any allergies to eggs, or to any medications in general?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of, no. I eat eggs all the time, make a good omelet if I do say so myself! Never had a reaction to anything a doctor gave me before, either. I've had all my shots growing up, and a few as an adult, never any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies, that’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, or have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just your usual aches and pains from, you know, getting older and doing physical work. I'm a building inspector, so I'm on my feet a lot, climbing around in buildings. Nothing a little ibuprofen can't handle, though. No high blood pressure or anything like that. Husband worries sometimes, but I feel pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay, building inspector - that explains the aches and pains! Ibuprofen as needed is fine. Any family history of serious medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let's see… My mom had some trouble with her heart when she got older, but she lived a long life, into her eighties. Dad was pretty healthy, actually. No cancer that I know of on either side, thankfully. Husband's side… his brother had something with his blood sugar, I think, a long time ago. Nothing major, as far as I know. It's been a while since we talked about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of heart disease and possible diabetes. Alright, Ms. Fornes, before we get to the shots, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I always get a little nervous around medical stuff, even though I know it's important.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, perfectly understandable. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And another one. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within a normal range. Let’s get you those shots then. Which arm do you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear everything sounds alright! Left arm is good, please. I'm right-handed, so I don't want it to be too sore for work. Thanks, Doctor. You're very thorough.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Ms. Fornes. We want to make sure you're protected and can continue doing your important work. There you go. You might feel a little soreness there for a day or two, but it shouldn't be too bad. I'm going to have you sit for about 15 minutes to make sure you don’t have any immediate reaction. I'll be right back to check on you. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Fifteen minutes is no problem. I always feel better when someone's keeping an eye on me afterwards, just in case. Thanks again, Doctor. It doesn't feel too bad yet.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I'll be right back. Please let me know if you experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, or any other unusual symptoms in the meantime. How are you feeling, Ms. Fornes?
PATIENT: I’m feeling okay, Doctor. A little sore, like you said, but nothing I can’t handle. No dizziness or anything like that. Just a little achy in the arm, really. Thanks for letting me sit for a bit, I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s what we like to hear. The injection site looks good, no excessive redness or swelling. I'm going to go ahead and give you a printed sheet with some information about potential side effects, and what to do if you experience any concerning symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good, Doctor. That pamphlet looks helpful, I’ll read it over when I get home. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and making me feel comfortable. You've been very kind. I think that’s all I needed for today.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I'm glad I could help. Just remember, if you experience any severe side effects, like a high fever, difficulty breathing, or a severe allergic reaction, please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just take it easy and allow your arm to rest. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything, thank you. Just getting ready to head out now. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kindness. Have a good day, Doctor Vanochten!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. You have a wonderful day as well, and please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: .
