DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Real nice to meet you too. Well, I reckon I'm here for that Men's Health thing. You know, just gettin' older, want to make sure everything’s still tickin' right. I’m Londell, by the way. Most folks just call me Lon.
DOCTOR: Good to meet you, Lon. Yes, the men’s health check-up is a great idea – proactive care is excellent. It’s good you’re thinking about this. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about what specifically prompted you to schedule this appointment today?
PATIENT: Well, now… it ain’t nothin’ specific, exactly. More like a general feelin’. I’ve been… a little more tired lately, I guess. And, uh… things just ain’t workin’ as smoothly as they used to, if you catch my drift. Not painful, just… not like they were. I’m 69, you know. Things wear out. But I figured I’d best get it checked while I still can, before somethin’ does go wrong. My wife… she always said I waited too long to see a doctor. I miss her somethin’ awful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common to experience changes as we get older, and it’s wise to get things checked out. It’s good you’re thinking of your health, and it sounds like your wife was a very thoughtful person. It’s good to honor her memory by taking care of yourself. So, tiredness and some changes in… urinary function, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sums it up pretty good. Urinary function… that's a polite way to put it, Doctor. And it's not just that, sometimes I get up a couple of times during the night to… well, you know. Never used to do that. And I’ve noticed… I don’t have the same pep I used to. Used to be able to work in the garden all day, now I get winded pretty quick. I still do my etchings, thank goodness, but even that’s takin’ a little more effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency of urination, especially at night, and some fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. And you mentioned you're still doing your etchings, which is wonderful. Do you notice any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain or burnin’. It's not uncomfortable, just… inconvenient. And sometimes a little worryin', you know? I don't want to end up with somethin’ serious. My wife, bless her heart, she always said I was too stubborn for my own good. I put things off. I'm tryin' to be better about that now. I've never had any trouble with prostate issues, if that matters. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear there’s no pain or burning. And it’s very good you’re addressing this now. It’s better to be proactive. No history of prostate issues is helpful information. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox. Had my share of scrapes and bruises, growin’ up wild in the woods. Back when I was in my thirties, I broke my wrist fallin’ off a horse, but it healed up fine. Other than that… not much. I had high blood pressure for a while, maybe ten years ago, but it came down with diet and exercise. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, probably five years or more. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I walk when I can. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that all counts, thank you. So, childhood illnesses, a broken wrist, resolved high blood pressure, and an appendectomy as a teenager. That’s a good overview. And you said the high blood pressure was managed with diet and exercise?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Doc told me to cut back on the salt and get movin’. And I did. Lost a little weight, felt a whole lot better. I’ve mostly kept it off, though I reckon I’ve put a few pounds back on since my wife passed. She did all the cookin’, you see. I’m not much of a cook myself. It's been a little over two years now. Still miss her every day.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Lon. It sounds like she was a wonderful person, and it’s understandable that you miss her greatly. Grief can affect many things, and it’s not uncommon for changes in appetite and activity levels to occur. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a baby aspirin every day, Doc told me to after a little scare with my heart a few years back – turned out to be nothin', just indigestion. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it. I don't believe in takin' a lot of pills if I can avoid it. I prefer to let nature take its course, as much as possible. And I try to eat a good diet, like I said. I do drink a little coffee in the mornin', if that counts. Black, no sugar.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a daily baby aspirin, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and black coffee. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. My wife was always a little worried about allergies, she had ‘em pretty bad, but I always seemed to be okay. She used to say I had a cast iron stomach. I reckon she was right. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, wild berries, strange fish… never had a problem. Though, now that I think about it, I do get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around certain flowers. But that’s just a mild irritation, not a full-blown allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known allergies, just some mild irritation with certain flowers. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of things, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yep, that's fine with me, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I ain't shy. Just let me know if somethin' feels uncomfortable. I reckon you gotta poke and prod to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, first I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, though I do hear a very slight wheeze on exhale. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142/88, and your pulse is 78 and regular. That blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look clear, your nose is clear, and your throat looks fine. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and strength. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in all your extremities. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but that elevated blood pressure and the slight wheeze are things we’ll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t bad at all, Doctor. You were gentle as could be. Glad to hear everything seems alright, mostly. That blood pressure… reckon I’ve been a little stressed lately. Missin’ my wife, worryin’ about gettin’ old… it adds up. And that wheeze… I’ve had a little cough now and then, figured it was just a cold. So, what do you reckon we ought to do about all that? Do I need any tests? Pills? I’m tryin’ to avoid them if I can, like I said.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lon. It’s good you’re aware of these things and want to be proactive. Stress definitely can contribute to elevated blood pressure, and a mild cough can sometimes indicate a variety of things. Given your age and symptoms, I think it would be prudent to order a few tests just to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a complete blood count , a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a chest X-ray to investigate that slight wheeze we heard. We’ll also do a urinalysis to check for any signs of infection. As for medication, let’s hold off on that for now. We’ll see what the test results show first. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to focus on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and managing your stress levels. Do you have any hobbies or activities that help you relax?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, that sounds sensible enough. Tests ain't the end of the world. I'll get those done. And you’re right about the stress. I do my etchings, mostly. That keeps my hands busy and my mind focused. And I like to walk in the woods when the weather’s good. Used to go with my wife… that was always nice. But it’s hard sometimes, you know? Just bein’ alone with my thoughts. I reckon I need to find somethin’ else to occupy my time. Maybe join a club or somethin’. I don't know. What about that chest X-ray? Will that tell you much? And how long will it take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: Etchings and walking are wonderful hobbies, Lon, and it’s good you have those. It’s completely understandable that you miss your wife, and finding new ways to occupy your time is a great idea. A local art club or a walking group might be a good fit. The chest X-ray will help us rule out any underlying lung conditions that could be causing the slight wheeze, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. It's a relatively quick and painless procedure. The lab results should be back within 3-5 business days. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a plan. We'll go over everything thoroughly, and I'll answer any questions you have. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as a high fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t reckon so, Doc. That all makes sense. 3-5 days… I can wait. And I'll keep an eye on things. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. You're a good doctor. Now, about those tests… where do I go to get them done? And do I need to fast or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lon, I appreciate that. I’m glad I could help. For the tests, you’ll need to go to the lab at St. Joseph’s Hospital – it’s just down the street at 123 Main Street. You don’t need a separate appointment, you can just walk in during their regular business hours, which are 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. For the CBC, BMP, and lipid panel, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks – you can drink water. The urinalysis doesn’t require fasting. I’ll have the lab technician send the results directly to my office. Once they arrive, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Here’s a lab requisition form with all the tests listed. And here’s a brochure with some information about managing stress and finding local resources. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: Nope, I reckon that’s everything, Doc. You’ve been mighty thorough. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s good to know there are still doctors out there who take the time to listen. I’ll go get those tests done, and I’ll be in touch when I hear back. Thanks again, Doctor Lahn.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lon. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
