DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're 35 years old. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. Thirty-five… though the years seem to… slip away. I believe I requested an appointment to discuss… plans for the future, should I become unable to make decisions for myself. Something about a form? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and I want to be certain things are handled according to my wishes, if… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. You're referring to advance care planning, specifically a durable power of attorney for healthcare and potentially a living will. It's quite responsible of you to consider this. So, you're concerned about designating someone to make medical decisions on your behalf should you lose the capacity to do so yourself. Before we proceed with the paperwork, I'd like to understand your overall health picture a little better. Perhaps we can start with any current medical conditions you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. “Durable power of attorney…” It all sounds so… formal. And a little frightening, to be honest. As for my health… that’s a difficult question. I spend a great deal of time working, etching and engraving. It requires… focus. And steady hands. I don’t recall any major conditions. I have occasional headaches, perhaps from straining my eyes, but nothing… serious. I had a bout of the flu last winter, I believe, but recovered quickly. I honestly can’t recall anything else of note. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Buoniconi. We will take our time. The headaches... are they new, or have you experienced them for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, they’ve been… on and off for years, I suppose. Ever since I began the etching, really. It’s a delicate work, you see, and requires intense concentration. I generally just… rest, and they subside. I hadn’t considered mentioning them, as they’ve never interfered with my work… or my daily life. Is that… something I should have mentioned? I’m truly sorry if I’m not being clear. It’s just… details escape me so easily these days.
DOCTOR: No, it’s fine. It’s good you mentioned them now. We are simply trying to get a complete picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I… occasionally take ibuprofen for the headaches, when they are particularly troublesome. Nothing regularly, and usually only a small dose. I do take a multivitamin, yes, to try and maintain my energy. The work is… demanding. Beyond that… I honestly can’t recall anything else. Perhaps I did take something at one point, but it escapes me. I apologize again. It’s terribly frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… that is another difficult question. I don’t believe so. As a child, I was quite prone to hay fever, but that hasn’t bothered me in years. I haven’t experienced any… reactions to anything recently. Nothing that I can recall, at least. I'm terribly sorry for my lack of precision. It’s just… my mind feels like a sieve these days. Is it alright if we simply proceed with the paperwork? Perhaps seeing it in writing will… clarify things for me.
DOCTOR: We can proceed with the advance directive paperwork. However, for legal purposes, I do need a more thorough understanding of your medical history. It is standard procedure. Before we begin, would you mind if I ask a few questions about past illnesses or surgeries you may have had?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Surgeries… past illnesses… I truly wish I could be of more assistance. It feels like a lifetime ago, if I ever knew at all. My childhood was… rather nomadic, and medical records weren't always… readily available. I recall a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, perhaps. And I broke my arm once, falling from a horse. But beyond that… my memory is a complete blank. It's terribly frustrating. Is it possible to proceed without that information? I understand it might complicate things, but… I simply cannot recall. Perhaps my general practitioner has records? I haven't seen him in years, however.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can proceed with the paperwork, but please understand this will be noted. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are you aware of any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke… anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… that is even more difficult. My parents… they passed away some time ago. We weren’t particularly close, and I never discussed their health with them. I know my mother suffered from… headaches, similar to my own, but beyond that… I have no idea. I believe my father had a… a weak heart, perhaps? But I’m truly grasping at straws here. I apologize. It feels as though my entire past is shrouded in mist. Perhaps it’s best if we simply focus on my wishes for the future, and leave the history… incomplete? I understand it’s not ideal, but… I’m doing my best.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconi, while I appreciate your willingness to proceed, a complete medical history is crucial for making informed decisions about your care, even in advance planning. However, given your limited recollection, we will do our best with what we have. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Social history… Well. I do not smoke. Never have. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, a small amount. Perhaps a glass two times a week. Beyond that… no. I do not use any recreational drugs. I find my work quite… stimulating enough, and have no need for anything else. It requires a clear mind, you see. I've always been rather… disciplined in that regard. Is that… sufficient information? I hope I am not being evasive. It is simply… a rather personal subject, and my mind feels… clouded.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any significant support systems?
PATIENT: Support systems… That is a difficult question. I was… divorced some time ago. My ex-husband and I are not in contact. I have a few… acquaintances, fellow artists and engravers, but none particularly close. I live alone, and manage my own affairs. I am… independent. Perhaps not the answer you were hoping for. It’s not that I don’t enjoy company, it’s simply… difficult to form lasting connections. I prefer to focus on my work. It provides me with… solace. I don’t rely on anyone, and… no one relies on me. I am… self-sufficient. Is that sufficient? I apologize for being so… bleak. It is simply the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconi. Given your medical history – or lack thereof – and your social circumstances, we will proceed with the advance directive paperwork. Before we begin, I want to ensure you understand the implications of designating a healthcare proxy. This individual will have the legal authority to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Do you have anyone in mind?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a difficult question. I hadn’t truly considered… designating anyone. I was hoping to simply… have the forms in place, should the need arise. I hadn’t anticipated having to choose someone. I… I don’t want to burden anyone with such a responsibility. My acquaintances… they are all quite focused on their own work, and I wouldn’t want to impose. Perhaps… perhaps it's best if I leave that section blank, for now. I can always revisit it at a later date, when I’ve had more time to consider. Is that… permissible? I understand it’s not ideal, but I truly don’t want to place that burden on anyone. I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions… for the time being, at least. I apologize for being so… indecisive. It’s simply… a difficult proposition.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconi, leaving the healthcare proxy section blank presents a significant legal and ethical challenge. Without a designated proxy, decisions would fall to family members – even estranged ones – or, ultimately, the court. While I respect your desire to avoid burdening anyone, it’s crucial to have a legally authorized representative in place. Perhaps we can explore a professional guardian service, or a trusted attorney who can act as your proxy?
PATIENT: A trusted attorney… That… that sounds… reasonable. I do have a solicitor who handles my estate, a Mr. Davies. He's quite… thorough. I hadn’t considered asking him to act as my proxy, but… it might be the most sensible option. Would that be… permissible? He knows my wishes regarding my estate, and is familiar with my affairs. It would certainly alleviate my concerns about burdening anyone close to me. Yes… that sounds… ideal, actually. Perhaps we can discuss that with him directly? I’m truly grateful for your suggestion, Doctor. It has… put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Very well. That is a sensible course of action. Now, let's proceed with the living will portion of the advance directive. This document outlines your wishes regarding end-of-life care, such as whether you wish to receive life-sustaining treatment, mechanical ventilation, or artificial nutrition and hydration. We will go through each section carefully, and you can indicate your preferences. Do you have any specific concerns or preferences regarding end-of-life care that you’d like to discuss now?
PATIENT: End-of-life care… That is a… difficult subject. I hadn’t truly given it much thought. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering… seems pointless. I wouldn’t want to be a burden, or… a vegetable. I believe in… dignity. And peace. I suppose… I would prefer comfort care, if that’s possible. Pain management. And… a peaceful passing. That’s all. I haven't anticipated needing to make such decisions, but… I suppose it’s better to be prepared. I’m trusting you to guide me through this, Doctor. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed step-by-step. This first section concerns resuscitation. It outlines your wishes regarding CPR and other life-sustaining measures in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest. We'll discuss each option carefully. Do you understand that choosing not to be resuscitated does not mean you will receive less comfort care?
PATIENT: Resuscitation… No, I understand. It simply means… not prolonging the inevitable. Comfort care… is always the priority. I… I don’t wish to be… jolted back to life, if there’s no hope of a meaningful recovery. I would prefer a peaceful passing, as I mentioned. Yes… that’s correct. Do Not Resuscitate. I believe that’s the… appropriate choice, for me. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is sufficient. Now, let's move on to the next section, which concerns artificial nutrition and hydration. This outlines your wishes regarding feeding tubes and intravenous fluids. Do you have any specific preferences regarding these interventions?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition and hydration… That sounds… rather unpleasant. I’ve always believed in… allowing nature to take its course. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. It seems… undignified. I suppose… I would prefer to decline these interventions, if I was unable to make my own decisions. I wouldn't want to prolong suffering unnecessarily. Yes... I believe I would prefer to decline. Unless, of course, it would alleviate pain. But if it simply prolongs suffering... then no. Is that... clear? I'm sorry if I'm being difficult. It's a rather distressing subject.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly clear, Ms. Buoniconi. We are simply documenting your preferences. Now, let’s move on to the final section of the living will, which concerns pain management. This outlines your wishes regarding medication and other therapies to alleviate pain and suffering. Do you have any specific requests or preferences regarding pain management?
PATIENT: Pain management… That is something I do feel strongly about. I wouldn't want to suffer unnecessarily, if I was unable to make my own decisions. If there was no hope of recovery, I would want to be kept comfortable, and pain-free. I wouldn't want to be kept in agony. Yes… I would want to receive whatever medication is necessary to alleviate pain, even if it meant… hastening my passing. Comfort is paramount, Doctor. I wouldn't want to be a burden, and I wouldn't want to suffer. Yes… aggressive pain management. That is my preference. I trust you to ensure I am comfortable, and pain-free, if the need arises. I… I believe that’s everything, isn’t it? I'm grateful for your guidance, Doctor. It has… put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is everything, Ms. Buoniconi. We have completed the advance directive paperwork. I will have these forms witnessed and notarized, and a copy will be placed in your medical record. You will also receive a copy for your records, and a copy will be given to your estate solicitor, Mr. Davies. Do you have any further questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is everything. You have been… most helpful. I feel… a great deal more at ease now, knowing my wishes have been documented. I am grateful for your patience and guidance. It wasn’t an easy conversation, but you made it… manageable. Perhaps it's best to simply… forget about it, and hope it never comes to pass. But knowing it’s in place… provides a certain peace of mind. Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. Truly. Perhaps we can leave it at that?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. That is perfectly acceptable. I will ensure these documents are handled appropriately. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And remember, should your wishes change, you can always update your advance directive. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Buoniconi.
