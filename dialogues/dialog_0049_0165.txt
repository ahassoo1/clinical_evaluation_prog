DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... this fever keeps comin' back. It's been a few weeks now, on and off. It's really gettin' old, to be honest. I'd like to figure out what's goin' on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a recurrent fever… a few weeks, you say. And what do you mean by “on and off”?
PATIENT: Well, it’ll be gone for a day or two, feelin' normal, then BAM, it's back. Usually in the evenin', feels like a bad flu comin' on, chills and all. Not always every evenin', but often. It goes away with some rest, usually. But it keeps comin' back, see? That's what worries me.
DOCTOR: Right, recurrent… evening fevers, relieved with rest. And how high would you say the fever gets, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really know. I haven’t taken my temperature. My wife usually does, but she's at her sister's for the week. Feels pretty warm, though, you know? Enough to make me tired and achy. I usually just take some ibuprofen and try to sleep it off.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no measured temperature, but you estimate it’s high enough to cause fatigue and body aches. And you've been managing it with ibuprofen. Do you notice any other symptoms with the fever?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes a little headache. And I get a bit of a cough, but it's not a bad cough. Just a tickle in my throat, really. No shortness of breath, nothin' like that. I haven't lost my appetite or anything, either. Just the fever, headache, and that little cough. Oh, and I sweat a lot when it hits. Really soaked.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fever, headache, mild cough, and night sweats. Have you traveled anywhere recently, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Nope, not for a long time. Last time was…hmm… Puerto Rico, about five years ago to see family. Haven’t been off the island since then. Just workin' and tryin' to keep things goin'. It’s all pretty local.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any underlying health conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it's nothin' serious. Just gets stiff sometimes. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but I don’t take anything for it. I try to watch my salt intake, that’s all. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, for my age. Well, I was before this fever started.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild arthritis and previously elevated blood pressure, managed with diet. Any family history of serious illness?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father had diabetes, and my mother had some kind of heart trouble when she got older. My sister's got asthma, but that's about it, I think. Not much else runs in the family, thankfully. They all lived to be pretty old, so I guess they did okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just that ibuprofen when the fever hits. And a multivitamin sometimes, but I forget to take it half the time. My wife usually reminds me. It's not a regular thing, I promise. Honestly, I try to avoid takin' pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Right. No regular medications. Okay, Mr. Brege, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just get this fever figured out, please. It's startin' to wear me thin.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your temperature. 101.7 Fahrenheit. A bit elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, rate is a little fast, but not alarming. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Lymph nodes are slightly enlarged in your neck, but not significantly tender. No obvious signs of infection here. Do you have any rashes or unusual skin changes anywhere?
PATIENT: Nope. No rashes, nothin' like that. Skin's been normal, as far as I can tell. My wife usually checks for things like that. I haven't noticed anything unusual, I promise. Just feelin' tired and achy, like I said. This fever's just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Alright. No rashes. So, elevated temperature, slightly enlarged lymph nodes, and a reported history of recurrent fever, headache, mild cough, and night sweats. Given your age and symptoms, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be a viral infection, but the persistence of the fever is concerning. I’d like to order some blood work to help rule things out. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a few tests to check for common infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's goin' on. I'm gettin' too old to be dealin' with this, honestly. Blood work sounds fine. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to get the results back. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. If your fever spikes above 103 Fahrenheit, or you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. While we’re waiting for the results, it might also be wise to consult with an infectious disease specialist, just to be cautious. Would you like me to arrange a referral for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, a referral would be good, Doctor. Just to be safe. I appreciate you thinkin' ahead. I'm mostly just tired of feelin' sick, to be honest. Hopefully, the blood work will tell us somethin'. And thanks for not brushin' me off. Some doctors don't take a fella my age seriously.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Brege. I'll get the nurse to draw your blood and schedule that referral for you. We'll get to the bottom of this. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
