DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. It’s not constant, but it’s worrying me. I… I don’t quite recall when it started, precisely. Perhaps a few weeks ago? It’s all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of unsteadiness. I understand it can be unsettling. “Hazy” is alright, we’ll try to piece things together. Can you describe what you mean by "unsteady"?
PATIENT: It’s… like trying to balance on a boat, perhaps? Not a rocking boat, but… a gentle sway. Sometimes I feel like I might fall, though I haven’t actually fallen yet, thankfully. It happens more when I’m walking, and… oh, I think it's worse when I turn my head quickly. But again, I'm not entirely sure. It’s frustrating, because I can’t pinpoint exactly what triggers it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it sounds like a balance issue, possibly worsening with quick head movements. That’s helpful. Has this been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I… work with the drills, you see, and it requires a steady hand and good footing. It hasn’t stopped me from working, but I’m definitely more cautious now. I worry about… well, about causing an accident, more than anything. And even simple things, like walking across a room, I find myself concentrating on not losing my balance. It's… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s impacting your work and requiring increased concentration. That definitely warrants investigation. Now, let's go through some other things. Do you experience any dizziness along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… that's a good question. Sometimes, yes. Not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like… a lightness in my head? A sort of… floating feeling. It doesn’t happen every time I feel unsteady, but it accompanies it occasionally. It's hard to describe. It’s not like being sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and that’s helpful information. Okay, “lightness” or a “floating” sensation. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any changes in your hearing recently?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that I haven’t noticed. My hearing… well, I suppose it's been alright. I work around loud machinery, naturally, so I'm accustomed to a certain level of noise. I wear ear protection, of course. I can’t say I’ve specifically noticed any changes, no. But I… I don’t actively listen for them, either. It’s possible I’ve just gotten used to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no reported ringing or hearing changes. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you had any headaches, vision changes, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Nothing severe, usually just a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go. Vision changes… no, not that I’m aware of. Everything seems clear enough. And no difficulty speaking, thankfully. Although… sometimes I find it hard to… to find the right words. But I always assumed that was just… being tired. It’s difficult to explain. It’s not a constant thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional dull headaches and sometimes trouble finding the right words. We're gathering information. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: I… I think I had a bit of a cold a few months ago. Nothing serious, just a sniffle and a cough. It didn’t last long. And… oh, I had the flu shot last winter, if that’s relevant. Apart from that… no, nothing significant. It’s been… a while since I’ve been truly unwell, to be honest. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold a few months ago and a flu shot last winter. Good. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My husband… he always handled those things. I… I know I’m generally healthy. I don’t take any regular medications. But… honestly, I don't recall any specific diagnoses. He took care of the appointments, the paperwork… everything. I’m sorry. It’s all rather… blurry. He passed away two years ago, you see. And… things haven’t been the same since.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. It’s a lot to keep track of, and grief can certainly make things more difficult. We can take our time. Let's try to recall any past surgeries you may have had, if any.
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. I had my appendix removed when I was a child, I believe. That was… a long time ago. And… oh, I had a small operation on my wrist a few years back, after a fall. It wasn't serious, just a minor fracture. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. It's possible I’m forgetting something, but those are the only two I can recall with any certainty.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in childhood and a wrist fracture a few years ago. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s another difficult question, Doctor. My family… we weren’t close. I didn’t see them often. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had diabetes, perhaps? It’s all rather vague, truthfully. We didn’t discuss these things openly. And… honestly, I don’t recall any other significant health issues. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s just… not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We’re gathering what information we can. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I don’t have any food allergies, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I've taken antibiotics and pain relievers when needed, and everything has been fine. I… I suppose I’m quite lucky in that regard. I don’t experience any rashes or swelling, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I work with heavy machinery, you see, and it’s important to be alert and focused. Besides… my husband didn’t approve of such things. I’ve always been a rather… sensible person.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. That’s good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I understand it’s necessary. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to work later this afternoon, you see. But… I trust your judgment. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Alright, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated but not alarming. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your neurological exam is mostly normal, but I did notice some mild unsteadiness with your balance and a slightly unsteady gait. These findings correlate with your symptoms. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Slightly unsteady… that sounds about right, I suppose. It’s reassuring to hear it’s not anything… serious. But… what does it mean, Doctor? Is it something I should be worried about? And… will it affect my ability to work? I’m concerned about causing an accident, as I mentioned before. It’s… a very stressful thought. What are the possible causes, and what can be done about it?
DOCTOR: Those are all valid concerns, Lilyanna. It’s good you’re asking these questions. The findings aren’t necessarily indicative of anything serious right away, but we need to investigate further to determine the underlying cause. Several things could be contributing to your unsteadiness. It could be related to inner ear problems – something affecting your vestibular system, which controls balance. It could also be related to mild neurological issues, or even medication side effects – though you’re not currently taking any. Less commonly, it could be a sign of something more significant, but given your overall health and normal exam, that’s less likely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. Specifically, I want to get a basic metabolic panel to check your overall health, a complete blood count, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any neurological abnormalities. I also want to refer you to an audiologist for a balance assessment to evaluate your inner ear function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, I suppose that’s necessary. It sounds… thorough, which is reassuring. An MRI… is that… painful? And will it take very long? I have to be back at work tomorrow, you see. And… what about the balance assessment? What will that involve? I… I’m not fond of being tested, truthfully. It makes me anxious. But I understand it’s important to find out what’s causing this. So, yes, please proceed with the tests. Just… please explain everything clearly, and let me know what to expect.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Lilyanna. We’ll take it one step at a time. The MRI is not painful at all. You’ll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will take about 30-45 minutes. You'll need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry, and inform the technician if you have any implants. It can be a bit noisy, so we’ll provide you with earplugs. You’ll be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. The balance assessment with the audiologist will involve a series of tests to evaluate your inner ear function and how your brain processes balance information. It may involve looking at eye movements, and possibly some tests where you have to walk on different surfaces. It will take about an hour. I’ll send the referrals electronically to the imaging center and the audiologist. They will contact you to schedule appointments. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activities that could increase your risk of falling. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No strenuous activities… that might be difficult, given my line of work. But I will try my best. And they will contact me to schedule the appointments? I… I’m not very good with paperwork or phone calls. Would it be possible for your office to assist me with that? I… I worry about missing something, or forgetting to schedule them. It’s just… a lot to keep track of. And… what if the results are… bad? What happens then? I… I’m getting anxious again. I apologize. It’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. And yes, absolutely, my office can assist you with scheduling the appointments. Just let the receptionist know that you'd like assistance with scheduling the MRI and the balance assessment, and they will handle it for you. As for what happens if the results are concerning, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If the MRI shows any abnormalities, we’ll discuss them with you in detail and determine the best course of action. That might involve further testing, or a referral to a neurologist. If the balance assessment reveals a problem with your inner ear, we’ll discuss treatment options, which might include medication or physical therapy. The important thing is to gather the information first. We're not jumping to conclusions here. We’re taking a systematic approach to figure out what’s causing your unsteadiness and get you back to feeling your best. Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can clarify for you at this point?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything, for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking it seriously. I’ll let the receptionist know about the appointments. And… I’ll try to avoid strenuous activities. It’s just… difficult, given my job. But I will do my best. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I understand. We’ll take it one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And don’t worry about contacting us if your symptoms worsen. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
