DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Vanochten, you say? Sounds… foreign. But never mind that. I’m here ‘cause… well, my daughter, she thinks I need a little… a little boost. A card, she said. From you. A “get well” card. I don’t feel sick, exactly. Just… low. You understand? A little down in the dumps.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Low,” or a little down. It's good your daughter is looking out for you. So, to clarify, you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms – like a fever, cough, or pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No coughin’ up anything. And pain… well, my knees ache sometimes, but that’s just… old age, Doctor. I’m 56, you know. Things ache. It’s a fact of life. This is… different. Just a little… blah. My daughter, she worries too much. She says I need encouragement. From a professional. That's what she told me, anyway. A card from you will fix it, she thinks.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no new pain besides the usual knee discomfort, and no other physical complaints. When did you start feeling this "blah" feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… Let me think. … It's been a few weeks, I reckon. After my divorce was finalized, mostly. That woman… always somethin’. Always complainin’. So, yeah, after all that settled. It's just… hard, you know? Being alone. But a card… she thinks you can help with a card. Seems a little silly, don't it?
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound silly at all, Mr. Kammer. Major life changes like a divorce can absolutely affect your overall well-being. It’s completely normal to feel down after something like that. We can certainly explore that. Besides feeling “down,” have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, I sleep alright. Maybe a little too alright. I could sleep all day if I let myself. But I try to stay busy. Gotta keep movin’, you know? Appetite… yeah, I eat. Not as much as I used to, maybe. But I like my food. And energy… well, I get tired easy. But that's probably just… gettin’ older, too. Like the knees. Everything slows down. But a card… you really think a card will help? Seems a little… simple, don’t it?
DOCTOR: It's not the card itself, Mr. Kammer, it’s what it represents – your daughter caring about you and encouraging you to seek support. But to get a better understanding of what’s going on, let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. … High blood pressure, yeah, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for it, every mornin’. And… I don't think anything else. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just the blood pressure. And the knees, of course. Always the knees. But honestly, Doctor, this is all a little much for a card, isn't it? My daughter… she means well, but she gets carried away. She reads too many articles on the internet, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, managed with medication. That's good. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one. A little white pill. Every mornin’ with my coffee. That’s it. I try to keep it simple, you know? Too many pills, too many doctors… it gets confusing. . Look, Doctor, I appreciate you askin’ all these questions, but… honestly, I just want a card. A nice card, with a kind message. Is that really too much to ask? My daughter is makin’ a big deal out of nothin’, I tell you. A card! .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're feeling perfectly capable, and a thorough medical workup seems unnecessary. However, your daughter's concern, combined with the changes you've described – the low energy, changes in appetite and sleep, and the emotional impact of the divorce – suggest it might be helpful to rule out other potential causes. It's possible this is simply a period of adjustment, but we want to make sure everything is alright. Would you be open to a brief physical exam and some basic blood work?
PATIENT: ... Blood work? A physical exam? For a card? Look, Doctor, with all due respect, this is gettin’ ridiculous. My daughter sent me here thinkin’ I needed somethin’ fancy, and now you're tellin’ me I need… poked and prodded? I came here for a little encouragement, not a full-blown medical investigation. I feel fine, mostly. A little sad, a little tired, but… that’s life, right? No. No blood work. No exam. Just… write somethin’ nice on a card and be done with it. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. Your health is ultimately your decision. If you truly feel a medical evaluation isn't necessary at this time, I respect that. However, I do want to reiterate that your daughter’s concern is valid, and sometimes, even when we feel okay, there can be underlying issues contributing to how we feel. In that case, I will document our conversation, noting your concerns and your decision to forego further testing. I can certainly write a note on a card, as your daughter requested, offering encouragement and support. Before I do that, would you mind if I just quickly check your blood pressure today to ensure it’s well-controlled?
