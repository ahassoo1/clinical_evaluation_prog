DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained a significant amount recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise routine. It’s quite worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weight gain can definitely be concerning when it happens unexpectedly. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When you say “recently,” about how long ago did you start noticing this weight gain, and roughly how much weight would you estimate you've gained?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began, I believe, around late February, perhaps early March of this year. And… approximately 15 kilograms, I would say. Perhaps a little more. I do keep track, you see. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Fifteen kilograms… that is a significant change over that timeframe. And you haven’t made any changes to your usual diet or exercise?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I eat the same things, the same portions, and I walk every day – about an hour, usually. My husband and I have a very… regular routine, and this is a disruption to it. It's… frustrating, more than anything. I feel quite helpless.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything else changed in your life recently – any new stressors, changes in sleep patterns, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Stress… not particularly, no. My husband and I are both retired, so life is… peaceful, generally. Sleep is good, I sleep seven, sometimes eight hours a night. Though… my daughter had a baby three months ago. Perhaps… the excitement of that? But I am helping with childcare, not providing full-time care. It's a joy, really, but not overly strenuous, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. I’ve not been feeling unwell, no fever or chills. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to getting older. My joints ache a bit, but that’s nothing new. Oh… and I do feel a bit warmer than I used to, sometimes. Not a fever, mind you, just… a bit flushed. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of increased fatigue and feeling warmer could be relevant. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all my life. A few childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. My husband always jokes that I'm too stubborn to get sick. I do take a daily vitamin, just a standard multivitamin, and occasionally something for my joints when they are particularly troublesome. But that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My mother had diabetes, type two, I believe. And my father… he had heart problems, later in life. His side of the family has a history of high blood pressure, as well. My husband’s family… relatively healthy, as far as I know. Though his mother did struggle with her weight, towards the end of her life, but that was more related to inactivity, I believe. Is that helpful? I can provide more details if needed, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A family history of diabetes and heart problems is good to know. Now, let's talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None at all. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. And as I mentioned before, just the daily multivitamin and occasionally something for my joints – ibuprofen, usually. Over-the-counter, nothing prescribed. I am very careful about what I put into my body, you see. It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Selbitschka, based on what you've told me – the unexplained weight gain, fatigue, feeling warmer, and your family history – it would be prudent to run a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'd like to check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and a complete metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I am happy to undergo. I simply want to understand what is happening and, if possible, rectify it. Please, proceed as you see fit. When would these tests be scheduled? And will they require a fasting period? I need to inform my husband, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can draw the blood today, and the lab will require a 12-hour fast beforehand, so no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. We'll also need to get your height and weight confirmed, just to have accurate baseline measurements. I’ll have the nurse take those after we finish talking. While we wait for the results, are you currently taking any herbal supplements or other over-the-counter remedies besides the ibuprofen and multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Just the ibuprofen occasionally for my joints, and the daily multivitamin. I am very cautious about adding anything new to my routine. I prefer to stick with what I know works, and I believe in moderation. No herbal supplements, no special teas, nothing like that. I assure you, I am quite straightforward in that regard. I hope that's helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Selbitschka. Thank you for being so thorough. Okay, so to summarise, we've discussed your weight gain, fatigue, family history, and that you've had no changes in diet or exercise. You have no known allergies, take only a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen, and you've had a 12-hour fast scheduled for the blood work. Now, before the nurse comes in, do you have any other concerns or symptoms you’d like to mention?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I’ve tried to be as comprehensive as possible. I am… admittedly anxious about the results, but I trust you will do your best to determine the cause of this. I suppose… just a quick question. How long will it typically take to receive the results? And will you contact me directly, or should I follow up with the clinic? I don’t want to be a bother, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab results to come back. I will personally review them and contact you directly with the findings, so you won't have to worry about following up. If anything urgent comes up, the nurse will be in touch. Alright, let’s get your height and weight measured and then we can proceed with the blood draw. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe I am quite prepared. Thank you for your thoroughness and patience. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I will await your call. And please, do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m glad I could help. I’ll be in touch soon.
