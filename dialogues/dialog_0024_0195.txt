DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly? It’s a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or, if that’s too much, maybe just a bit of encouragement. My sister… she’s been a bit down lately, and a card from a doctor… well, it would mean something, wouldn’t it? More than just me saying things.
DOCTOR: A… a card, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Is that so strange? Everyone likes a nice card. She thinks I don't listen to her problems, and a card from a professional... a doctor... would show her I’m taking things seriously. It's just a small thing, but it would make her feel better. Honestly, people don't understand how important little gestures are these days. You're a doctor, you should understand the power of suggestion, shouldn’t you?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, I am a physician. I diagnose and treat medical conditions. I do not… dispense emotional support via stationery. Perhaps a visit with a counselor would be more beneficial. Do you have any actual medical complaints that I can address?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re being difficult. And condescending, if I may say so. I haven’t come here to be examined, Doctor, I just thought it was a reasonable request. It’s not like I’m asking for a prescription, just a few words on a piece of paper! Honestly, the things they train doctors on these days… no common sense at all. And what’s wrong with a little emotional support? It is part of health, isn’t it? You're supposed to care about people, not just their symptoms. Are you saying my sister’s feelings aren’t important enough for a simple card? Really, Doctor, you're being quite unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I assure you, I do care about my patients’ well-being. However, my time is limited, and I have other individuals waiting who require legitimate medical attention. Perhaps if you were experiencing symptoms – a fever, a cough, something – we could proceed with a proper consultation. But this… this is simply not within the scope of my practice. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, so now you're implying I’m wasting your time? Honestly! My sister is having a hard time, and that is a medical problem! It affects her sleep, her appetite… everything! And you’re sitting there asking about pills? I don’t need pills, she needs a little kindness, a little… acknowledgement! It’s just a card, Doctor! A small gesture of support. You see patients with headaches, don’t you? I bet a headache feels worse than this, and you happily give them something for that. Are you trying to tell me my sister’s feelings are less important than a headache? I truly thought doctors were more empathetic than this. No, I'm not on any medications. I stay healthy, unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, let us be clear. Emotional distress, while unpleasant, is not a medical condition requiring pharmaceutical intervention, nor does it necessitate a personalized greeting card from your physician. It sounds as though your sister might benefit from talking to a qualified therapist. I can provide you with a referral, if you wish. Otherwise, I must respectfully ask you to schedule another appointment when you have a genuine medical concern. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Are you serious? We’re talking about my sister’s emotional well-being, and you want to know about allergies? This is beyond ridiculous. I came here for a simple request, a small act of kindness, and you’re treating me like I’m asking for a limb to be amputated! A therapist? She doesn’t need a therapist, she needs someone to listen! And a card from a doctor would show her people are listening! Honestly, you’re completely missing the point. I don’t understand why it’s so difficult for you to understand. No, I don't have any allergies. I eat a very healthy diet. You know, perhaps if you spent less time pushing pills and more time actually talking to your patients, you wouldn’t have such difficult cases. Really, Doctor, this is just… appalling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am attempting to conduct a medical consultation. You are requesting a service that falls entirely outside the parameters of my professional obligations. Furthermore, your continued insistence on this matter is disrupting my schedule and preventing me from assisting patients with legitimate medical needs. I will ask you one final time: do you have any actual medical complaints, or shall I simply conclude this appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, so now I’m the problem? You’re blaming me for your lack of compassion? Honestly, the audacity! It’s just a card, Doctor! A tiny piece of paper with a few kind words! And you’re treating me like I’m asking you to perform a miracle! You went into medicine to help people, didn’t you? And now you’re hiding behind “professional obligations”? What kind of doctor are you? I… fine. No, I don’t have any “actual medical complaints” as you so dismissively put it. But don’t come crying to me when your patients realize you’re all heartless robots! Just… forget it. I came here hoping for a little kindness, and I got… this. I’ve wasted enough of my time. And yours, apparently. .
