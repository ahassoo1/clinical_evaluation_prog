DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… Shanor is fine. Yes. I… need check for referee. For fitness. They want. For… sports. Little bit running, jumping. That is all. I want do good.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A sports physical, then. We want to ensure you're in good health for your activities. “Referee” – is that a new position you’re taking up, or are you participating in sports yourself?
PATIENT: No, not play. I… watch. Tell people… rules. Stop fight. That is all. Been doing… long time. They just… need paper. For insurance, maybe? I don’t… understand all the paper. Just want to be okay to keep doing it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Shanor. It sounds like you're a referee, ensuring fair play and safety in your sport. And yes, these forms are often required for insurance or league regulations. We’ll get everything sorted out. To start, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you mind if I ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Questions okay. Quick questions is good. I… have things to do later. Not much time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Shanor. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – for example, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… healthy. Always work hard. Maybe little… back pain sometimes. From work. But… not important. Old job… repair stuff. Hot work. That is all. No… sick. Never been sick much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Shanor. And you mentioned some back pain from your previous job. Is that pain still present now, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not bad. When I… bend a lot. Or… lift heavy. Now… not so much. I… rest more. Old job gone. New job… not so hard. Mostly… talking to people. Watching. Less… bending. Less lifting. Okay now. Really. Not worry.
DOCTOR: I see. That's good to hear that your current job is less physically demanding. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgery. No hospital. I… broke arm when small boy. But… that is long time ago. Just… doctor put it in cast. Then… okay. Never need hospital. Never need… cut. Everything… normal. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, Mr. Shanor. And have you had any serious illnesses or injuries as an adult – anything that required a lot of medical attention?
PATIENT: No. I… maybe flu sometimes. But… just rest. Drink water. Not… doctor. I… strong. I… fix things. Not get sick. I think. Maybe… little cough in winter. But… everyone get cough. It’s cold. Not… serious. Nothing like… hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No pills. No… nothing. Just… water. Maybe coffee sometimes. For work. Keep me awake. But… no medicine. Never take… anything. Not need. I… healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… eat everything. Sometimes… spicy food. Makes me… sweat. But… not allergy. Just… spicy. No… nothing bad. No… itchy. No… swelling. Just… spicy. I think. Never… problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to know, Mr. Shanor. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – for example, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Um… family… far away. I… not see much. Mother… gone. Father… gone. Brothers… sisters… in China. I… don't know much. Maybe… heart trouble with uncle. Long time ago. I… not sure. Old story. I… don’t ask. Too far. Don't want to worry. Sorry. I… don’t know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It’s understandable that you don’t have much information about your family’s medical history. No need to apologize. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I… work. I… watch sports. I… fix things. I… eat. I… sleep. Simple. Not much else. I… walk. Sometimes. To shop. Sometimes to… park. Not… exercise. Just… walk. I… try to be good. But… work takes time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. Maybe… little beer sometimes. With friends. But… not much. Very little. Not… every day. Just… sometimes. To relax. But… not problem. No… drugs. Never. I… don’t like that. Bad for… everything. Just… little beer sometimes. Very little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Shanor. That’s good to know. Alright, let’s move on to a physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Quick exam is good. I… have things. Want finish quickly. Okay. Let’s do it. I… ready. Quick. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. I will be as efficient as possible. Please, have a seat on the examination table.

Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks good there as well. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'll just do a quick range of motion assessment. Your range of motion is also good. Everything appears to be in good working order, Mr. Shanor. Do you have any pain anywhere at the moment?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Maybe… little tired. But… that is from work. Not… hurt. Everything… okay. Seems… good. Finished now? I… need go. Thank you, Doctor. Very quick. Very good.

So, to summarize, you have no significant medical conditions, no allergies, are not taking any medications, and the physical exam was within normal limits. I will prepare a sports physical form for you, noting these findings. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
