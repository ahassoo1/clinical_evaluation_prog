DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really have time for a lot of chit-chat. I just… want to make sure I can have a baby, you know? Without any… trouble. My late husband and I always talked about it, and now… well, time isn't getting any younger. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Right. Fertility concerns. I understand wanting to be efficient. “Time not getting younger” is… a valid concern. Alright. To get a better picture, let’s start with some basics. Have you been trying to conceive for a specific amount of time?
PATIENT: Trying? Honestly, not really. It hasn’t… gotten that far. I was hoping to avoid the whole trying part being difficult, if that makes sense. I just want to know if there’s anything… wrong with me, before I even start. Is that weird? I mean, shouldn't there be a check-up before everything else?
DOCTOR: It's not weird, Ms. Villarreal. It's… proactive, let's call it. Though usually, we establish a baseline after a period of unsuccessful attempts. But, alright. You want a preventative assessment. We can do that. First, let’s go through some medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, history. Honestly, it was a long time ago, and frankly, not a happy time. I had… something with my appendix when I was younger, I think. And some routine things, you know, tonsils when I was a kid. But nothing major. And honestly, I don’t remember all the details. My husband always handled all that stuff. Is it important? Will it really make a difference?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and tonsillectomy are noted. It can be relevant, Ms. Villarreal. Scar tissue can, in rare cases, affect certain things, but we'll see. More pertinent to your current situation would be any history of pelvic inflammatory disease, sexually transmitted infections, or irregular menstrual cycles. Have you experienced any of those?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t appreciate being asked all these… personal questions. My late husband and I… we were very careful. I don’t see what any of that has to do with anything. And my periods? Perfectly regular, thank you very much. Always have been. Always will be. Honestly, I'm starting to think this was a waste of my time. I just want to know if I can have a baby, not get interrogated about my past.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your sensitivity, truly. However, these questions aren't intended to be an interrogation. They are essential to forming a complete picture of your health and identifying potential factors that could affect fertility. Dismissing relevant medical history hinders my ability to provide you with accurate information. But alright. If you’re uncomfortable discussing past STIs, we can move on. Let's focus on your current menstrual cycle. You say it’s regular, but can you describe what “regular” means for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Regular means… every month. About every 28 days, give or take. It starts, it stops, it starts again. Normal. Like clockwork. I don’t keep a calendar or anything, I just know. Is that good enough? Honestly, I just want a quick blood test or something to tell me if everything is okay. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: "Like clockwork" is… helpful, to a degree. A 28-day cycle is within the normal range. However, a simple blood test won't give us the full picture. We need to assess your hormone levels, ovarian reserve, and potentially rule out other underlying issues. Before we order any tests, let's quickly cover your family history. Have any of your close relatives – mother, sisters – experienced difficulty conceiving or gone through early menopause?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Honestly, I wasn’t close to my mother. She… passed away when I was young. And I don't have any sisters. I was an only child. So, no. No one. Really. I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting my time here. Can we just… get the tests done? I have things to do. I'm sure everything is fine, and this is all just… unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. We can order a basic hormone panel and a complete blood count. However, I strongly advise against dismissing a thorough assessment. It’s in your best interest to have a comprehensive understanding of your reproductive health. I'll have the lab technician draw the samples. They'll explain the process. The results will take approximately five to seven business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
