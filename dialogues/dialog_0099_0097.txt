DOCTOR: Right. Marija Chilla, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Overgaard. It’s… well, my husband and I have been discussing, and frankly, it’s a bit unsettling, but we feel it’s prudent to have some… arrangements made. Things documented, you understand. We’d like to discuss what you call an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form, I believe? My husband did some research online. It’s about… what happens if I am unable to make decisions for myself.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive…yes, a sensible precaution, I suppose, though most people don’t bother until it’s far too late. Your husband seems…informed. It's good you're thinking about this now. Though, frankly, most online information is… suspect. Let's clarify what you understand about these documents, before we proceed. What specifically are you hoping to accomplish with this?
PATIENT: Well, honestly, Doctor, I mostly left the understanding to my husband. He’s always been rather… thorough. I just know he said it’s about telling you what medical things I wouldn’t want, should something… drastic happen. Like, if I was unconscious and couldn't speak for myself. He said it would prevent… unwanted interventions. I trust his judgment entirely, of course. It's just… a bit morbid, don't you think? Though, I suppose, better to be prepared.
DOCTOR: “Unwanted interventions.” A vague term, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Well, I assume he means… things that would prolong life artificially, if there’s no prospect of recovery. Things that would… keep me tethered to machines, uncomfortable and… undignified. My husband explained it quite clearly, though I confess I wasn’t entirely focused on the specifics. He’s a retired engineer, you see, very precise with his language. It’s his concern, really. He worries. Perhaps you should speak with him directly? He’s very detailed.
DOCTOR: So, you're leaving the specifics to your husband. That’s… unusual. While I appreciate a concerned spouse, these are your wishes we need to document. I need you to tell me, specifically, what you would want or not want in various medical scenarios. For example, if you were to experience a severe stroke with no chance of regaining function, would you want a feeding tube?
PATIENT: A feeding tube? Oh, dear. That’s… rather graphic, isn’t it? Honestly, Doctor, I hadn’t even considered the particulars. My husband mentioned things like ventilators and resuscitation, but a tube… I suppose… if there was absolutely no hope, then no. I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially, a burden on everyone. But if there was even a slight chance of recovery, then yes, of course. Though, how would anyone know what a “slight chance” is? It all seems so… subjective. I truly believe my husband has a better grasp on these things. He reads medical journals, you know. Perhaps you should consult with him?
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Mrs. Chilla, I am the doctor here. I need your input. Your husband reading medical journals does not make him qualified to decide your medical care. We need to discuss your values, your fears, your wishes. It’s all very well to say “slight chance,” but what defines that chance for you?
PATIENT: Doctor, I find your tone rather… condescending. I assure you, my husband is a very intelligent man, and perfectly capable of articulating our wishes. It's simply that I’m not… comfortable discussing such morbid details. It’s unsettling. And frankly, I’m paying for your expertise, not a lecture on my husband’s qualifications. If you require specific answers, perhaps you should address him directly. He’s available by phone. Here’s his number. He’s a retired engineer, as I mentioned, and accustomed to precise communication. Perhaps he can provide the “specific answers” you seem to be seeking.
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand you prefer your husband to handle this. However, I must inform you that a valid Advance Directive requires your informed consent. I can, of course, schedule a time for him to come in and discuss this with me. But ultimately, I need to be able to verify your understanding and agreement with any decisions made. I also want to document that you appear reluctant to engage in this discussion directly, and that your husband will be primarily responsible for articulating your wishes. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Perfectly correct. My husband is far more… capable of navigating these complex matters. I trust his judgment implicitly. And frankly, I find your insistence on my direct involvement… unnecessary. It's rather… distressing, as I've stated. Yes, document whatever you deem necessary. I simply wish to have the matter resolved as efficiently as possible. I have a luncheon appointment, you see, and I’m already running late. Perhaps we should focus on scheduling a consultation with my husband? He's available tomorrow afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will schedule a consultation with your husband. However, please understand that I will still need to briefly speak with you to confirm you are aware of the discussion and agree to the final decisions. That is standard procedure. I have his number now. I will have my assistant contact him to arrange a time. Is there anything else I can document before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have my husband’s number. He will be able to provide you with all the necessary details. I trust he will make everything perfectly clear. Thank you for your time. I'd appreciate a prompt scheduling, as my husband is quite busy. Good day. .
