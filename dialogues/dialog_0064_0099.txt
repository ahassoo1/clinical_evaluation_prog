DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as your receptionist explained, I received the results from a test… a GI test, I believe it was called? And it seems something wasn’t quite right. I must admit, I’m not entirely sure what all the details mean, but I was hoping you could explain them to me. It’s a bit worrisome, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, the GI test results. I see. It can be unsettling when you get results back without a clear explanation. No worries at all, that's what I'm here for. Let me pull those up now… Alright, I have them here. Just to be sure, was this test done because you were experiencing any particular symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, it was. For several weeks now, I’ve been having… discomfort. It’s difficult to describe precisely. Not pain, exactly, but a sort of… queasiness. And a bit of bloating, mostly after I eat. It comes and goes, but it’s been frequent enough to be concerning. I also noticed… a change in my usual bowel habits, if you don’t mind me saying so. It’s a bit embarrassing, but I thought it best to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Denis. It’s important to be thorough, and I appreciate you sharing all of that with me. It’s all helpful information. Bloating, queasiness… and a change in bowel habits. Okay. And when did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… It began, I believe, around the middle of June. Perhaps the 15th or 20th. At first, I dismissed it as something I’d eaten. We had a small family gathering, and I suspect I overindulged. But it didn’t resolve after a few days, and it’s been… persistent since then. It's grown slowly worse, not suddenly, if that makes sense. I thought it might just be my age catching up to me, but my daughter insisted I see a doctor. She's quite concerned, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Around mid-June, and gradually worsening… That’s good information. And your daughter was right to encourage you to get it checked out. It’s always best to investigate these things. Now, can you tell me a little more about the change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… less frequent than usual. And when I do go, it's… thinner than it normally is. Not watery, exactly, but not as formed as it should be. Also, I’ve noticed a small amount of… blood. Just a tiny bit, usually mixed in with the stool. It hasn’t been a large amount, thankfully, but enough to worry me. It only happens occasionally, but it's been enough to make me quite uneasy, if I’m honest. I hadn’t experienced anything like that before.
DOCTOR: Okay, less frequent, thinner stools, and occasional blood… I understand your concern, Denis, and it's good that you're paying attention to these changes. Blood in the stool is always something we need to investigate. Has there been any change in the color of the stool itself, apart from the blood?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Now that you mention it… yes, actually. It’s… darker than usual. Not black, precisely, but a very dark brown. And sometimes… almost clay-colored, I suppose you could say. That hasn’t been frequent, but it’s happened on a few occasions. I hadn’t thought much of it at the time, but perhaps it’s relevant. I do apologize, I’m not very good at describing these things! I hope I’m not being too tedious.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Denis! You're being perfectly clear, and you’re not tedious at all. It's very helpful to have all these details. Darker, sometimes clay-colored stools… that’s important information. Now, let’s talk about your diet. Have you noticed any connection between what you eat and your symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s a sensible question. I have noticed some correlation, yes. Rich foods, like creamy sauces or fried things, tend to aggravate it. They cause more bloating and discomfort. Also, citrus fruits… they seem to upset my stomach quite a bit. But I haven’t been able to identify any specific food that consistently triggers it. I’ve tried eliminating a few things from my diet, but it hasn’t made a significant difference. I used to have a rather adventurous palate, but I’ve been rather cautious lately, to be honest. Mostly plain foods now.
DOCTOR: Rich foods and citrus fruits aggravate it… That gives us a clue. And you've been mostly sticking to plain foods, trying to minimize the discomfort. Now, besides the GI issues, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… Hmm. I have been rather tired lately, more so than usual. I attributed it to my age, of course. And my appetite has been… diminished. Not entirely gone, but I don't feel as hungry as I once did. I've also had a bit of… unintentional weight loss, perhaps a few pounds. It's not dramatic, but noticeable. Also, I’ve been feeling a bit weak, occasionally dizzy. But those could be unrelated, perhaps the weather? It's been quite hot lately, you know. I apologize for rambling. I'm simply trying to recall everything that might be relevant.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Denis. It's important to recall everything, even things that seem minor. Fatigue, diminished appetite, unintentional weight loss, weakness, dizziness… Those are all things we need to consider. Now, let’s go through some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, perhaps thirty years ago now. It caused quite a bit of discomfort, but the surgery went well, and I haven't had any issues since. Apart from that… I haven't been diagnosed with any other significant medical conditions. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing major. I've always been quite healthy, generally speaking. I do take a mild medication for my blood pressure, but it's well-controlled, and my doctor says it’s not a cause for concern. And... my husband passed away five years ago. That was... difficult. I'm still adjusting, I suppose. But physically, I've been in good health until recently.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removed thirty years ago, mild medication for blood pressure, and the loss of your husband five years ago. I’m very sorry for your loss, Denis. That is a significant life event, and it’s understandable that it would still be affecting you. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a difficult time, but I’m managing. As for allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to medications, foods, or anything else. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a rash or difficulty breathing after taking any medication. My daughter is quite allergic to shellfish, so I’m always careful when cooking, but I don't have any allergies myself. I’ve always considered myself rather lucky in that regard. Is there anything else you need to know? I do hope I’m not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not taking up too much of my time at all, Denis. This is all very helpful information. So, no known allergies. Now, just one more question regarding your past. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. No, I don't believe so. The gallbladder removal was the only surgery I've ever had. I had a rather nasty bout of appendicitis when I was a child, but the doctors managed to treat it with medication. And I've had the usual vaccinations, of course, but no other surgeries. I've always been rather fortunate to avoid them. I do try to stay active, you see. Gentle exercise, mostly walking. I believe that’s contributed to my good health, generally speaking. Though, lately… I haven't been feeling quite myself. But I digress. Is there anything else I can tell you?
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. That's good to know. Now, Denis, based on what you’ve told me – the changes in your bowel habits, the blood in your stool, the weight loss, the fatigue, and the dark stools – I’m concerned enough that we need to do some further investigation. It could be a number of things, and I don't want to jump to any conclusions. However, these symptoms warrant a more thorough workup. Would you be comfortable if I ordered a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for any abnormalities?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’d prefer to know what’s going on, rather than simply wonder about it. Blood tests and a stool test… Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. It’s a bit daunting, to be honest, but I understand it’s necessary. Will those tests require any special preparation? And when can I expect the results? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m a bit anxious, you see. It’s just… one never knows, does one?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Denis. It is unsettling to not know what’s going on. The blood tests will require you to fast for about eight to twelve hours beforehand, and we’ll give you specific instructions when you schedule them. The stool test will involve collecting a small sample at home, and we'll provide a kit and detailed instructions as well. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days to come back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, significant bleeding, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that, or about anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all quite clear. Fasting for the blood tests, collect a sample for the stool test… and contact the emergency room if anything worsens. I've made a note of that. Three to five business days for the results… that’s acceptable. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously. I suppose I should schedule those tests now, then? And I’ll keep a close eye on things in the meantime. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. It’s a comfort to know there are still doctors who take the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could put your mind at ease, even just a little. Yes, let’s go ahead and get those tests scheduled. My nurse, Maria, will be right in to assist you with that. She’ll also give you all the necessary paperwork and instructions. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all, before or after the tests. We're here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on. I’ll let Maria contact me, and I’ll follow her instructions carefully. I truly appreciate your kindness. I believe that’s all for now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
