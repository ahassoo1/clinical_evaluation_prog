DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, let's begin. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? You want to know why I am here? They sent me. The company. Said I need to… check everything is okay. Even though everything is okay. Been working in that mine for… long time. No problems. They worry too much, these young folks.
DOCTOR: I see. A company-mandated check-up, then. While I appreciate your…assurance of good health, Mr. Bigger, these examinations are quite standard for individuals in physically demanding professions. It is simply a precaution, you understand. To ensure everything is indeed as you say. Perhaps you could tell me a little bit more about what you do at the mine?
PATIENT: What do I do? I operate the machines! Big machines. Move the rocks, the… the stuff from underground. Been doing it… since before you were born, I expect. Heavy work, but a man needs to earn a living, yes? It’s not like sitting in an office pushing papers. Real work.
DOCTOR: Yes, certainly. A vital profession, Mr. Bigger. And I assure you, all work has its merits. Now, regarding these machines…do you experience any particular strain when operating them?
PATIENT: Strain? What kind of strain? It’s work, Doctor. You lift, you pull, you push. My back gets tired sometimes, like any man’s after a long day. But I'm not weak. I’ve always been strong. It’s not like these new machines are any harder than the old ones. They just…shake a bit more, maybe?
DOCTOR: “Shake a bit more,” you say. And how long have you been noticing this…shaking?
PATIENT: Eh? How long? A while now. Maybe…five years? Six? Time flies when you are working, yes? It’s always been a bit…rumble-y down there. The mine isn’t a quiet place, you understand. Rocks falling, machines going… normal mine noise. Not something to worry about.
DOCTOR: I understand that it's a noisy environment, Mr. Bigger. However, any new or changing sensations – even if you believe them to be minor – are worth noting. Besides the shaking, have you noticed any pain, numbness, or tingling in your hands, arms, or back?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Sometimes my fingers get…cold. But that’s the dust, yes? It gets everywhere. Makes everything cold and gritty. And back… well, like I said, it gets tired. Old age, maybe. Not pain. I’m a tough man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any difficulties with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? What are you asking? I walk straight, if that's what you mean. Been walking all my life. Never fallen over. I climb stairs, I carry things, I…I do what a man needs to do. You are asking silly questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Bigger, these are not "silly" questions. They are part of a standard neurological assessment. Now, have you noticed any changes in your memory or concentration lately?
PATIENT: Memory? Concentration? Look, I remember what I need to remember. I remember how to operate the machines, I remember where I live, I remember… well, I remember enough! Things slip your mind sometimes when you get older, yes? Doesn't mean anything is wrong. You are trying to find something that isn't there. I told you, everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your…frustration. However, I am obligated to conduct a thorough examination, regardless of your assurances. Perhaps a brief physical assessment would be beneficial. Would you mind if I checked your reflexes, strength, and range of motion?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Strength? You think I'm some weak old man? I can still outwork most men half my age! I don't need you poking and prodding me like some… some child! I came here because they told me to. I’ve answered your questions. Everything is fine! I’m going home.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. However, I must document my inability to perform a complete assessment due to your refusal. I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – weakness, numbness, dizziness, or changes in your memory – please seek immediate medical attention. I will send the company a summary of our conversation, noting your self-reported good health and refusal of physical examination. .
PATIENT: .
