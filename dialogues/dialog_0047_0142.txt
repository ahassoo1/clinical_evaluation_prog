DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. Headaches, mostly. Bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come… well, I get really sweaty and my heart races. It's not nice, to be honest. I don't really… remember exactly when they started, or anything. It's been a while, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. “Bad ones,” you say. And you're experiencing sweating and a racing heart with the headaches?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it exactly. Sweating and my heart feeling like it’s gonna jump outta my chest. They usually happen together, I think. Not always, but… most times. It’s hard to pin down, you know? My memory’s… not the best. It's just a really unpleasant feeling, all around.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when you say "not the best," is this a recent change in your memory, or has it always been like that?
PATIENT: Always, I reckon. Always been a bit… foggy. Not sudden or anything. Just… never been good at remembering dates or details, really. My ex-wife used to get really frustrated with it, always saying I'd forget important things. It's just… how my head works, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, longstanding memory issues. We'll make a note of that. Now, these headaches… can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Uhm… it’s not like a sharp pain, exactly. More… a pressure, all over my head. Like someone’s tightening a band around it. And sometimes it feels like it's throbbing, I guess? It's hard to explain. It's just… really uncomfortable. Like a really bad tension headache, maybe? I don't really know all the different types, to be honest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It's helpful, thank you. And where do you typically feel the pressure?
PATIENT: Mostly all over, like I said. But I think it’s worse around my temples, maybe? And sometimes it feels like it's in the back of my head, at the base of my skull. It kind of… radiates outwards, if that makes sense. It's not always in the same place, either. That’s what makes it hard to describe, I suppose. It shifts around a bit.
DOCTOR: Right. Shifting pain. Okay. And how often would you say these headaches occur?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven't a clue. It's not every day, definitely. Maybe a few times a month? Sometimes it’ll be a few weeks between them, and then I’ll get a couple close together. It's really unpredictable. I wish I could be more specific, but I really don’t keep track. I just… deal with them when they come.
DOCTOR: Intermittent, unpredictable. And are there any specific things that seem to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: I haven’t noticed anything specific, no. Stress, maybe? But I’m always a bit stressed, to be honest, so it’s hard to tell. And… bright lights sometimes? But again, I'm often around bright lights, so it’s hard to say if that's a cause or just happens at the same time. I wish I knew what sets them off, it would be a lot easier to avoid them. I really don't know. It’s just… random, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. So no clear triggers. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I can think of. Maybe a bit nauseous sometimes, when they’re really bad. But I don't actually be sick, if that makes sense. Just… feel like I might. And… a bit dizzy, maybe? But that could just be from standing up too fast. I don’t know. Nothing major, nothing constant. Just… little things, here and there.
DOCTOR: And do you notice any changes in your vision when these headaches occur?
PATIENT: Changes in my… vision? Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything looks normal, I think. I haven’t seen any spots or blurry patches or anything like that. I wear glasses, you know, so things are always a bit… adjusted. But my vision hasn't gotten any worse with the headaches, not that I’m aware of. It's hard to tell the difference, maybe? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't take much in the way of medication, either. Just the occasional painkiller for the headaches, when they’re really bad. Paracetamol, usually. And… I’m not allergic to anything, not that I’ve ever been told. I don’t have any food allergies, or anything like that. I think I'd know if I did, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing regularly. Just the paracetamol when I need it, like I said. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest. I just… try to push through it, usually. It’s not ideal, I know, but I just don't really like the thought of being on medication all the time. It feels… unnecessary, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Uhm… to be honest, I don’t have much of one. I haven’t been to the doctor much in my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and stuff. But nothing major. No serious operations or anything like that. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid, but that’s about it. My ex-wife always said I was too stubborn to go to the doctor, even when I needed to. Does that help? I really don’t have much to tell you, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone in your family had similar headaches or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: That's a good question... Hmm. My mother used to get migraines, I think. Bad ones, she said. But she didn't go to the doctor much either. And my father... he had high blood pressure, I think. But again, I don't know much about it. He passed away a few years ago. And I don't really keep in touch with my siblings, so I don't know much about their health either. So, I guess, potentially migraines and high blood pressure, but it's all a bit vague, to be honest. Sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Right, lifestyle… Well, I work in a factory, mostly doing… stuff. Production work, you know? It’s not too physically demanding, but it’s long hours on my feet. I live alone, after the divorce. Don't really have much of a social life, to be honest. I watch a bit of telly, read a bit. Try to stay active, but… it’s hard to find the motivation sometimes. I don't drink much, and I don't smoke. Pretty boring, really. Is there anything specific you want to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, just to be thorough, do you have any history of head injury or trauma?
PATIENT: Head injury… hmm. Not that I can recall, no. I might have bumped my head a few times as a kid, you know, falling over and stuff. But nothing serious. No concussions or anything like that. I definitely haven't had any major head trauma. Nothing I remember, anyway. Is that… concerning? It's just, my memory's not great, so I can't be 100% sure. But I'm pretty sure I haven't had any serious head injuries.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, Mr. Lawther. Thank you for that information. Let me just quickly summarise. You're a 22-year-old male presenting with intermittent headaches, described as a pressure sensation, sometimes throbbing, predominantly around the temples and base of the skull. These are accompanied occasionally by nausea and dizziness. They aren’t triggered by anything specific, and you report longstanding memory issues. No significant past medical history, family history of migraines and hypertension, and a relatively uneventful lifestyle. No history of head trauma. Now, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your headaches with the information we have. Given your memory issues, we need to consider a range of possibilities. We could be looking at tension headaches, migraines, or something else entirely. I’d like to conduct a quick neurological examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds alright, yeah. A neurological examination. If that’s what you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. Just… let me know if it’s going to be anything… unpleasant? I'm not great with needles, you know. But other than that, yeah. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of these headaches, if possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No needles involved, I assure you. It's a series of simple tests to assess your reflexes, balance, coordination, and cranial nerves. Nothing painful or invasive. If you could just sit here, please. We’ll start with your reflexes. Just relax your arms and legs. Now, I’m going to tap these areas with this small hammer. Tell me if that feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… simple enough. Go ahead then. Tap away. Just let me know if it’s going to be… a sharp tap, or something? I’m a bit jumpy, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Relax… good. And the other leg… Now, just keep your feet flat on the floor, and I'm going to check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose, repeatedly, with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Okay, here goes… Like this? Is that right? It's a bit… harder than it looks with my eyes closed, you know. I might be a bit off.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Just do your best. Now, open your eyes, please. And I’m going to shine a light into your eyes. Just follow my finger with your gaze. Look left… look right… look up… look down… Good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale…
PATIENT: Okay… left… right… up… down… Deep breath… exhale… That’s alright, isn’t it? It’s not… a bad thing, hearing that? I always worry when people listen to my heart, you know. It sometimes feels like it’s racing.
DOCTOR: No, it's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious during an examination. Your heart sounds regular, but I did notice a slightly elevated heart rate. It's probably related to your anxiety, but we'll keep an eye on it. Everything else appears normal. Based on this examination, and the information you’ve provided, I suspect you may be experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and anxiety. Your slightly elevated heart rate and occasional dizziness could also be linked to this. However, given your memory concerns, I would like to order a few tests to rule out any other potential causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid function test, and an MRI of the brain. The MRI will help us assess your brain structure and identify any abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… a bit serious, doesn't it? But if you think it’s necessary, then yeah. Sure. A blood test and an MRI. Whatever you need. It's just… is the MRI… uncomfortable? Claustrophobic? I've heard stories. I’m not great in tight spaces, you know. But if it’ll help find out what’s wrong, then I’ll do it. And what about the blood test? Will that hurt much? I’m not a fan of needles, as you know.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious about an MRI, Mr. Lawther. It can be a bit unsettling, but we can take steps to make it more comfortable. The machine is quite open now, not like the old ones. And you'll have headphones on, you can listen to music. We can also give you something to help you relax if you're particularly anxious. It’s also quite quick, only about 20-30 minutes. The blood test will be just a small prick in your arm. It’s a quick procedure, and the nurse is very good. It will sting for a moment, but it’s over quickly. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and I’ll contact you to discuss them. I’ll write you a referral for the blood test and the MRI. Do you have any questions at all?
PATIENT: Right. Music, and something to relax… that sounds… better. And a quick prick. I can manage a quick prick, I think. Okay. A referral for the blood test and the MRI. Yes. That’s alright. And… when I get the results, I just phone you? No appointment? Just… a phone call? That’s good. Less stressful. Um… no, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not making me feel silly about the headaches.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your headaches worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll have the nurse print out the referrals and some information about managing tension headaches. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Take care, and I’ll speak to you soon. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will contact you if anything changes. Thank you again. Bye.
