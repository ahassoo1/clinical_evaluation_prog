DOCTOR: Good morning, Brodie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Oh, right. This cough. It’s been… well, a long time now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Feels like something’s tickling the back of my throat, you know? Doesn’t bring anything up, if you catch my drift. Just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dry, irritating cough that doesn’t produce any mucus. And you said it's been going on for a long time... could you give me a rough estimate of how long, Brodie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Long time… Let me think. It feels like… since the winter, maybe? Or was it spring? Time just… slips away, you know? My wife, she always kept track of things… but it's been a few months, at least. Maybe longer. I really couldn't say for sure. It just sort of… started being there, one day.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be hard to keep track. A few months, then. And has anything specific seemed to make it worse, or better, during that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse? Well, dust, definitely. Used to work on cars, you see. Body work mostly, but there’s always dust. Even now, cleaning around the house… gets to me. Better? Not really, not that I've noticed. Sometimes it’s just… less bothersome for a little while, then it comes back. I drink a lot of tea, that helps a little with the tickle, maybe? But it doesn't stop it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust seems to be a trigger, and tea provides some temporary relief. That's good to know. Besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get a little… tired, I suppose. But I’m 90 years old, Doctor! I figure some tiredness comes with the territory. Not much energy for doing things, but I just thought that was… old age. Nothing specifically with the cough, not that I can remember. Sometimes my chest feels a little tight, but that could be… well, everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and occasional chest tightness. We’ll definitely look into those. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I recall. No chills either. And weight loss… Well, my clothes are a little looser, maybe? But I haven’t been trying to lose weight, and I haven’t been eating much less, if any. Probably just… shrinking, Doctor. It happens when you get old.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Brodie. It’s good we’re taking everything into account. Now, do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems… hmm. Not that I know of. Never been to the hospital for anything like that. The doctor back home… he always just gave me something for a cold when I coughed, and it would go away. This… this is different. It’s just… always there. My wife, she handled all the doctor stuff, mostly. I just… went when she told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior history of lung problems that you’re aware of. And your wife managed most of your healthcare previously. That's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just some pills for my blood pressure. Small white ones. Can't remember the name, though. And allergies… I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. But honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. If my wife was here… she’d know all this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. It’s alright if you don’t recall everything. We can work through this. Just the blood pressure medication is good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I don’t do much these days, Doctor. Mostly stay home. Watch some TV, read the paper. I used to garden, but my back… it doesn't allow for that anymore. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing exciting, I’m afraid. Just… quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet lifestyle, no smoking, and limited alcohol consumption. That’s good to know. Alright, Brodie, I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Then we can talk about a plan. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brodie, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your breath sounds are a little diminished bilaterally, and I can hear some mild wheezing, especially on exhalation. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. There’s no tenderness to palpation. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard, it sounds like you may have some chronic bronchitis, possibly with a component of asthma. However, given your age and the duration of your symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities, like pneumonia or even something more serious. I think it would be helpful to get a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… Sounds… serious. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes. I want to know what's going on. I just… don't want any surprises. My wife… she always took care of all this. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Brodie. It's good to be thorough. The X-ray will help us look at your lungs and see if there's any sign of infection or other problems. The blood work will help us check for inflammation and rule out other possibilities. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a day or two. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It’s called albuterol. You’ll use it as needed when you feel short of breath or wheezing. I’ll also recommend increasing your fluid intake to help thin out any mucus in your lungs. Do you have any questions about the inhaler or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Inhaler… Albuterol… Is that… a strong medicine? I don't want anything that’ll make me feel… strange. And how do you use one of those things? I’ve never had to use an inhaler before. And what about the fluids? Just water? Tea?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Brodie. Albuterol is a relatively mild medicine, but it can cause some side effects, like a slightly increased heart rate or some shakiness. Most people don’t experience any significant side effects, but it’s good to be aware of them. As for how to use it, it’s quite simple. I’ll have the nurse come in and demonstrate the proper technique. Basically, you shake the inhaler well, exhale completely, put the mouthpiece in your mouth, and press the canister down while taking a slow, deep breath. You hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then exhale slowly. It’s important to rinse your mouth out with water after each use to prevent thrush. And regarding fluids, water is best, but tea is fine too, as long as it’s not caffeinated. Staying well-hydrated helps thin out the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Rinse my mouth… thrush… It sounds… complicated. I'll probably need a lot of help with this. And if I can't breathe… what do I do? Should I call someone? 911? My wife… she always knew what to do in an emergency. I feel a little lost without her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Brodie. It can seem complicated at first, but I assure you, with a little practice, it will become much easier. The nurse will go over everything with you step-by-step, and she can answer any questions you have. As for what to do if you can’t breathe, yes, absolutely call 911. Don't hesitate. If you feel severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, call 911 immediately. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to see how you're doing and review the results of the X-ray and blood work. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. I'm here to help you, Brodie, and we'll get through this together. Do you feel comfortable with the plan so far?
PATIENT: A week… that feels like a long time to be waiting. But… if you think it's best, Doctor. And 911… yes, I remember that number. Yes… I think I feel… okay with the plan. A little scared, maybe. But okay. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for being patient with me. It's just… hard without her.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. It's perfectly understandable to be scared, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially after losing your wife. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all – even if it’s just to talk. I’ll have the nurse come in now to demonstrate the inhaler technique and answer any remaining questions. I'll also make sure you have a written summary of everything we discussed, including the instructions for the inhaler and the contact information for the office. We’ll get through this together, Brodie. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I just… hope I can remember everything. And I hope this inhaler… works.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. It's alright if you forget things – we can always review them. And I'm confident the inhaler will help. We'll monitor your progress closely and adjust the plan as needed. Just try to relax and focus on taking things one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse come in now. Please don't hesitate to call if you think of any other questions. .
