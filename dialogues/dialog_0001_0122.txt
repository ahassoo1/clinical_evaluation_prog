DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara, have a seat. Look, I'm Audel Pehrson, and I'm… a doctor here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Pehrson. Thank you for seeing me. I am Venus Alvara. It is… difficult to explain, but I have been noticing… lapses. Small things, mostly. Things I should remember, but… do not. It worries me, because my blood pressure has been… not good. I read about such things.
DOCTOR: Lapses, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Not… forgetting everything. Just… names, sometimes. Or where I put my keys. Yesterday, I made tea, and… I simply could not recall why I went to the kitchen. It is… unsettling. I do not like feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a lot of things can cause that. Stress, mostly. You said your blood pressure isn't good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It has been… elevated for some time. My husband… he passed two years ago. It was… sudden. I believe the stress has not helped. But these… these are not just feelings of being overwhelmed. They are… gaps. Like a piece is missing. It is very precise. I remember knowing something, and then… nothing. A moment later, it returns. But the feeling… it is alarming.
DOCTOR: Two years ago… alright. And these "gaps," how often would you say they happen?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to say precisely, Doctor. Perhaps… three or four times a week? Sometimes more. It feels… random. It is not linked to specific events, as far as I can tell. One day, I will recall everything perfectly. The next… a small detail will vanish. It is not constant, but it is frequent enough to cause me… distress. I do apologize for being so… verbose. I am not used to speaking about such things.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Alvara, a lot of people get a little forgetful as they get older. It's normal. You're stressed, you lost your husband… perfectly understandable. We can check your blood pressure, make sure that's under control, and maybe… just relax a little. Have you tried any relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: Doctor, with respect, I understand you see many patients. But I assure you, this is not simply… age, or grief. I have always had a very… precise memory. I managed many properties, many accounts. Details were essential. This is different. I know when I should remember something. It is not a simple case of… misplacing my spectacles. And relaxation… I do enjoy a quiet evening with a book, but this is not helped by that. I am… concerned. It feels like something more serious. Is it possible… something is happening with my brain?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not going to jump to conclusions. We can do a basic cognitive assessment, just to rule things out. But honestly, it sounds like anxiety. A lot of people worry too much. Do you have any family history of… mental illness?
PATIENT: Mental illness… no, not that I am aware of. My mother… she was a very strong woman, always calm. My father… he was an engineer, very logical. Neither of them… suffered from such things. I do understand you are busy, Doctor, but I am truly concerned. This is not… worry. This is… a disruption. A break in… the normal order of things. I managed finances, legal documents, entire estates! I assure you, I know the difference between anxiety and… this.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just get some basic information down. Have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I prefer… natural remedies, when possible. A good night's sleep, a healthy diet… I believe in taking care of oneself. I avoid medications if I can. They always have… side effects. I understand you must be thorough, but I do hope we can… investigate this further.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I have lived a… simple life, in that regard. I do not react to… plants, or animals, or foods. I have never required an EpiPen, or antihistamines, or any such thing. Is it… is it possible this could be related to the blood pressure? I have read about… the effects of hypertension on the brain. Is that something you can check?
DOCTOR: We'll check your blood pressure, of course. That's standard. And we can do a quick memory test. Just… simple things. Repeat three words, draw a clock. You know. Don't worry yourself about it. Let's just get it over with.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Three words… and a clock. I am ready when you are. I simply wish to… understand what is happening. The uncertainty is… most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write these down. Repeat after me: Apple… Table… Penny. Now, can you draw a clock showing ten minutes after eleven?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes, I can draw a clock. There. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Not bad. Now, let's just check your blood pressure. Sit still, relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I am relaxed. As relaxed as one can be, given the circumstances.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95. Still elevated. As expected. Look, Ms. Alvara, your blood pressure is the primary concern here. We need to get that under control. I’m going to prescribe you a low dose of Lisinopril. It should help. The forgetfulness… it’s likely a side effect of stress, and potentially, the high blood pressure itself.
PATIENT: Lisinopril… A medication… I had hoped to avoid that, Doctor. I have read about the… side effects of such drugs. And with respect, I still believe this is more than simply stress, or blood pressure. The lapses are… precise. Not simply vague forgetfulness. They are like… gaps in a recording. I would prefer to explore other options, if possible. Perhaps a scan… or an examination by a specialist? Before resorting to medication?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Alvara, I've been doing this for seventeen years. I know what I’m talking about. A scan isn’t going to magically fix things. And a specialist?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I am not questioning your experience. I am simply… advocating for myself. I manage large estates, complex financial portfolios. I am accustomed to… thorough investigation. I do not simply accept the first diagnosis, or the first treatment. I require… evidence. Is there a possibility… even a small one… that something else is occurring? Perhaps an issue with… blood flow to the brain? A minor blockage? I simply wish to rule out all possibilities before introducing a medication with potential… complications.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're… particular. Fine. We can order a basic MRI, just to appease you. But don't expect miracles. It's probably just stress. But you'll need to schedule that yourself. I don’t handle the scheduling here. And it will be expensive, since you're not insured.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I understand it will be expensive, but… peace of mind is worth a great deal. And I assure you, I am not simply being… difficult. I simply wish to understand what is occurring. Could you please provide me with the name of a reputable imaging center? And… perhaps a list of questions I should ask when scheduling the appointment? I would prefer to be prepared.
