DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested this visit myself... I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s something I've been thinking about for a while now, and I felt it was best to just get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. That’s very proactive of you. It’s always best to address these concerns. To ensure we proceed appropriately, may I ask what prompted you to consider HIV testing at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Honestly, it's been a few things. My husband and I… we haven’t been as careful lately, if you understand what I mean. And there's been some talk amongst friends... just things you hear. It's better to be safe than sorry, you know? I just want peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Shaub. It’s very responsible of you to consider this, and peace of mind is certainly a valid reason for testing. To give you the most comprehensive care, could you tell me a bit more about your and your husband’s sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Well… we’ve been married for a long time, nearly forty years. We are both faithful to each other, of course. But… things change as you get older. Let's just say we've experimented a little more recently. Nothing too wild, but… different positions, sometimes without… protection. Is that alright to share? I hope I’m not being too forward. I just want to give you all the information you need.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. You are not being forward at all. It’s essential I have a complete understanding of your situation to provide the best care. Thank you for being so open. When you say "recently," approximately how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… perhaps the last six months or so? It hasn't been constant, mind you. Maybe a handful of times. We hadn't really discussed protection… foolish of us, I suppose. It just… didn’t cross my mind after all this time. We've always been so careful before, you see? It felt… different this time, and I began to worry.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. It's very common for practices to change over time, and it's admirable that you are addressing this now. Just to clarify, have either you or your husband had any symptoms that have concerned you – things like fever, fatigue, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, or any skin rashes or unusual sores?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, neither of us have experienced anything like that. We both feel quite healthy, all things considered. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I put that down to my age and the summer heat, to be honest. My husband is very active in the garden, so he's always a bit worn out! No, no concerning symptoms at all. That’s why I’m probably being overly cautious, but I’d rather be safe.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Shaub. Being proactive about your health is never a cause for apology, especially given your circumstances. Now, let's briefly review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I've been very fortunate in that regard. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that’s long gone. My husband is allergic to certain pollens, but that’s about it for our family. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm generally quite healthy, as I said. Do you need a list of medications I’ve taken in the past? I can’t recall them all offhand.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Shaub. A full list isn’t necessary at this time. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... I take a small dose of medication for my blood pressure, it’s been slightly elevated for a few years now. And I take a daily vitamin D supplement, especially in the winter months. My doctor recommended it. Other than that, no. Just the usual painkillers when I have a headache, but nothing regular. I try to stay away from too many pills, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Ms. Shaub. Minimizing unnecessary medication is always a good approach. Before we proceed with the HIV testing, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I’ve been very lucky, really. My mother had arthritis, but I haven’t experienced anything like that. My blood pressure is the only thing that's been a bit troublesome, but it’s well-managed with medication. No heart problems, no kidney issues, no diabetes… nothing like that. I have had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was asking, Ms. Shaub. Thank you. And have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for any significant reasons?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that's about it. And I was hospitalized briefly after giving birth to my daughter, but that was over forty years ago, and everything went smoothly. No other surgeries, no other significant hospital stays. Just the usual check-ups and routine procedures. I've always been quite careful to avoid needing serious medical attention, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Shaub. It sounds like you’ve taken very good care of yourself. Now, before we proceed, are you comfortable with me conducting a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. I don't mind at all. I suppose it's a good idea, just to be thorough. What will it involve? Just checking my blood pressure again, I assume? I hope you don't mind me asking. I'm not very good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shaub. I understand concerns about needles. The exam will be fairly basic. I’ll check your vital signs - that includes blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and skin. We will need to draw blood for the HIV test. The blood draw is generally quick and relatively painless. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. As long as it’s quick, I think I can handle it. I always get a bit anxious with blood tests, but I trust your expertise. The heart and lungs sound alright, too. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind. And let me know if it’s going to sting! It’s silly, I know, but I get nervous just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shaub. I will certainly be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll let you know exactly what I'm doing as I go along, and I’ll warn you before the blood draw. It’s not silly at all to be anxious, and I respect your feelings. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm comfortably at your side. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s slightly elevated, but consistent with previous readings. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular with no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear with good air entry on both sides. No wheezing or crackles detected. Now, I’m going to take a look at your throat and skin. Please open your mouth wide and say "Ah".
PATIENT: Ahhhh… Is everything alright? My throat feels a little dry, but I don’t feel any pain. I do have a bit of sun damage on my skin, from all those years gardening, but nothing serious, I hope. I always try to wear a hat, but sometimes I forget.
DOCTOR: Your throat appears slightly dry, as you mentioned, but there’s no evidence of infection or inflammation. Your skin does show some signs of sun damage, but nothing concerning at this time. It's good that you wear a hat when you remember! It’s important to protect your skin. Now, we'll proceed with the blood draw for the HIV test. I’ll use a clean needle and disposable collection tube. I'll clean the area on your inner arm with an antiseptic wipe. You may feel a brief sting as the needle enters your skin. Please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. This may feel cold. Okay, we’re almost done… just a little bit more. There you go. All finished. Please keep pressure on this site for a few minutes to stop any bleeding.
PATIENT: Oh… that did sting a bit! But it’s over now, thankfully. Yes, keep the pressure on… I’m pressing down firmly. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? And will I need to come back for them, or will you call me? I’m a bit anxious, I must admit. It’s silly, but I keep thinking about… well, you know.
DOCTOR: You did very well, Ms. Shaub. It’s perfectly normal to feel a sting. You can use this bandage to cover the site. The results usually take between one to two weeks to come back from the lab. I will personally call you with the results as soon as they are available. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we will discuss them thoroughly when I call. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or rash, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me, and I appreciate it. It’s good to know I’ve finally addressed this concern. I'll just try to stay calm and wait for your call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if any concerns arise before I call. Have a good day, Ms. Shaub.
