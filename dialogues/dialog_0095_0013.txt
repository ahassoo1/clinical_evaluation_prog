DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's…trouble with going to the bathroom, if you don’t mind me saying. I just…can’t seem to get everything out, you know? It’s been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with complete bladder emptying. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it, exactly. Complete emptying…that's a good way to put it. It feels like…like there's always some left in there, even after I try. It’s not painful, not really. Just…uncomfortable, and a little worrying. I have to go back pretty often, too, to try and finish.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, not painful, just a sensation of incomplete emptying, and you’re finding yourself needing to return to the bathroom frequently. How long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…maybe six weeks ago, now? At first, I thought it was just a fluke, you know? Something I ate, maybe. But it hasn’t gone away. It’s been pretty steady for the last month, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a month steadily. Have you noticed any other changes when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Well…now that you mention it, the stream doesn't feel as strong as it used to. It's more…of a trickle, than a good, steady flow. I didn't really think much of it before, but now that I'm thinking about it, that’s changed too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a weaker stream as well. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my belly…lower part is alright. No pain there, thankfully. Just the trouble with going, like we talked about. It's just…annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Do you have any trouble starting the stream, or is it just the force of the stream that's weaker once you begin?
PATIENT: No trouble starting, thankfully. I can go when I need to, no problem there. It's just…once it gets going, it's not as strong as it used to be. Like you said, weaker.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes in my…pee? Hmm. Not that I've seen, no. Looks the same to me. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so that could be it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially darker urine due to tea consumption. Do you have a history of diabetes, or has that ever been a concern for you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never been told I have that, Doctor. And nobody in my family has it, as far as I know. I mostly eat fish, berries…the old ways. Not much sugar in my diet.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know about your family history and diet. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gives me, you know? I take a little pill for my blood pressure, Doctor Vanochten. And sometimes something for my joints, when they bother me. That's about it. Medicare pays for them, so I take what they give me. I don’t remember the names, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and something for joint pain. I can look those up in your chart. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor gave me. I've been taking pills for years, now, and never had trouble. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Hilber, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That's just to check your abdomen and do a brief neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my bladder, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could lie down on the table for me, please. I’ll listen to your abdomen first. Just relax and breathe normally. I'm not feeling any tenderness in your abdomen. Your bladder doesn't feel significantly distended, either. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes quickly. Could you point your toes and flex your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Like this? I used to walk a lot on the tundra, so my feet are still pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Your reflexes seem normal. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This is common in men your age, and it's essentially an enlargement of the prostate gland that can cause urinary difficulties. However, we need to confirm this with a couple of tests. I'd like to order a urine analysis to rule out infection, and a PSA blood test to check your prostate-specific antigen levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Benign…what was it? Hyper…something? My pro…state? It sounds complicated, Doctor. Is it serious? And what's a PSA? I’m not good with these medical terms, I'm afraid. Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Mr. Hilber. It can sound complicated. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH, means the prostate gland is enlarged, but it's not cancer. It’s very common as men get older. The prostate surrounds your bladder, so when it gets bigger, it can squeeze the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of your body. That's why you're having trouble emptying your bladder and the stream is weaker. The PSA test is a blood test that checks for a protein produced by the prostate. It can help us assess the size of your prostate and rule out other possibilities. We'll use this to help figure out if you need any treatment. It's not necessarily something to worry about, but it's important to check. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s better, thank you, Doctor. So…it’s not cancer, that’s good. And it’s just an enlargement…like a bigger muscle? And the tests will tell us how big it is, and if I need…something done about it? I guess that’s alright. Tests don’t bother me. Just want to get this figured out, so I can stop running to the bathroom all the time.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's similar to a bigger muscle – just an enlargement. The tests will help us determine the size and see if any treatment is needed. Okay, I’ll get the lab order for the urine analysis and the PSA test. The nurse will draw your blood and collect a urine sample before you leave. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding caffeine and alcohol. We can also discuss some lifestyle adjustments that may help relieve your symptoms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Plenty of water…no coffee. I can do that. And I’ll talk to the nurse about the blood draw and the…urine. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It helps to know what’s going on, even if it's just a bigger muscle.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to get you set up for the tests. If you have any questions before then, or after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the clinic.
