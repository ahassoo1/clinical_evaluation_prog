DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Please, call me Johney. Well, it’s about the smoking, really. I’ve been… at it for a long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to do something about it. It's gotten to be a bit much, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Johney. That's a very good first step, acknowledging it's time to make a change. “A long time” – could you tell me roughly how many years you’ve been smoking, and about how much you typically smoke in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I started when I was about sixteen, so that would be… fifty-eight years now. And how much… well, usually a pack and a half a day. Sometimes two, if I’m… stressed. It’s not a good habit, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a pack and a half to two packs a day for fifty-eight years. That’s significant, Johney. Have you tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. Several times, actually. Patches, gum… even those things you inhale. They help for a little while, but… the craving always comes back. It’s a terrible feeling, this need for a cigarette. It's difficult to explain. It's not just the nicotine, you see. It's... a habit, a routine. A comfort, even.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is often more than just the nicotine; it's the behavioral aspects too. And those cravings are very real and powerful. Besides the cravings, have you noticed any other symptoms – any cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I do get a bit breathless when I climb the stairs. Always figured it was just my age, to be honest. And there’s a cough, yes. Not a terrible one, but it's there, especially in the mornings. I don’t have any chest pain, not really. Just… tired, a lot of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion and a morning cough… those are things we need to take seriously given your smoking history. Do you have any other medical problems – things like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I've been quite lucky, actually. I've always been a fairly healthy man, despite the cigarettes. My doctor back home – in Lithuania, you see – he always said I had a strong constitution. But even a strong constitution can only last so long, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. And you’re right, even the strongest constitutions have limits. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a one. Never needed surgery, never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. I’ve always been one to avoid doctors if I could, to be truthful. But… I think this is something I can’t avoid anymore.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Johney. It takes courage to come in and address something like this. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any heart problems, lung disease, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he died of a heart attack when he was in his sixties. And my sister, she had lung cancer, but that was… oh, fifteen years ago now? She didn’t smoke, though. Other than that… not that I recall. My mother lived to be ninety-two, very healthy woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart attack in your father and lung cancer in your sister. That's important information. And you said your mother was healthy. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… you mean… what do I do? I live alone, Doctor. Never married. I used to work at the factory, building… well, it doesn't matter what. I’m retired now, been retired for fifteen years. Mostly I keep to myself, read a lot, watch the television. I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And… well, I smoke. A lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Johney. That gives me a better understanding. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. Never had any allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most pills… although I prefer not to, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and get a general sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgement. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time, so I suppose I’m overdue for a check-up, regardless.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… I hear some diminished breath sounds, and some mild wheezing, especially on the lower lobes. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. I’d like to check your oxygen saturation next. 92%. That's a bit low as well. These findings are consistent with chronic lung disease, likely from years of smoking. Do you have any questions about what I’m hearing so far?
PATIENT: Chronic lung disease… that doesn't sound good. So, the smoking has… done this to me? I suspected as much, of course, but… to hear it said aloud… Is it… serious, Doctor? What does this mean for me? I'm not afraid of a little bad news, but I'd like to know what I'm facing.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you want to know, Johney. Yes, the smoking has significantly impacted your lungs. We call it Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD. It’s not a single disease, but a group of lung diseases that block airflow and make it difficult to breathe. The severity can vary greatly. Your oxygen saturation is a bit low, and the wheezing indicates some airway narrowing. Right now, it sounds like it’s in the early to moderate stages. That means with treatment and, most importantly, quitting smoking, we can often slow down the progression and manage your symptoms. However, if left untreated, it can become quite serious, leading to more frequent shortness of breath, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of infections. To get a better understanding of the extent of the damage, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test – that's a breathing test that measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A chest X-ray and a breathing test… whatever it takes to get a clear picture. I understand it’s serious, and I’m willing to do whatever I need to do. And… you mentioned quitting smoking again. I’ve tried so many times… What options are there now? What can you do to help me? I need something… stronger, I think. Something that will really help me break this habit, once and for all.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Johney. Your willingness to quit is the most important step. And you're right, there are more options available now than ever before. We can discuss several approaches. First, there are nicotine replacement therapies - patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, even nasal sprays – which can help reduce cravings by providing controlled doses of nicotine without the harmful chemicals in cigarettes. Second, there are prescription medications like bupropion and varenicline that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms by affecting chemicals in the brain. Third, behavioral counseling and support groups can provide you with coping strategies and encouragement. I often recommend a combination of these approaches for the best results. We also have resources at the clinic to connect you with smoking cessation programs and support groups. I also want to ask about your home environment. Do you have anyone who smokes around you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nobody smokes around me. I live alone, as I mentioned. It's… always been just me and my cigarettes. I suppose that makes it easier, in a way. But… harder too. There’s no one to… encourage me, or hold me accountable. The medication… that sounds promising. I’m willing to try anything, if it means I can finally get rid of this habit. And the counseling… I suppose that wouldn’t hurt either. I’ve always been a private man, but… I understand I might need help this time. What do you recommend as a first step, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Johney. Given your long smoking history and previous attempts to quit, I recommend we start with a combination approach. First, I’ll write you a prescription for varenicline. It’s generally more effective than bupropion for heavier smokers, but it does have some potential side effects, so we’ll discuss those in detail. Second, I'll have the nurse schedule you for a consultation with our smoking cessation counselor. She can help you develop a personalized quit plan, identify triggers, and teach you coping strategies. Third, we’ll schedule the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test to get a baseline assessment of your lung function. Finally, let’s set a quit date. How about two weeks from today?
PATIENT: Two weeks… August sixteenth. Yes, that sounds… manageable. It’s a bit daunting, to be honest, but I’m willing to try. I want to be able to breathe again, Doctor. And I want to… be healthier, for as long as I can. The side effects… please, tell me about them. I’d rather know what to expect, than be caught off guard. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help, more than you know. It’s… a relief, to finally have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. It's my job to help you, and I'm glad we’ve got a plan in place. Varenicline can cause some side effects, and it’s important to be aware of them. The most common are nausea, headache, and sleep disturbances – vivid dreams, insomnia, or difficulty sleeping. Some people also experience dizziness or constipation. More rarely, it can cause changes in mood or behavior, including depression or suicidal thoughts. If you experience any changes in mood or behavior, it’s crucial to contact me or seek immediate medical attention. We'll monitor you closely throughout the process. We'll also discuss potential interactions with other medications you might be taking, though you mentioned you don't take any regularly. I'll write the prescription now and the nurse will give you detailed instructions on how to take it and what to expect. She'll also schedule your appointment with the smoking cessation counselor and the imaging tests. Do you have any questions about any of this before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. I understand the side effects, and I will contact you immediately if I experience any changes in my mood. I'm ready to get started. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. I hope this finally works.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Johney. I'm optimistic too. I'll have the nurse come in and give you the prescription and schedule those appointments. Remember, quitting smoking is a challenging process, but you're not alone. We're here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a pamphlet with some additional resources on quitting smoking. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
