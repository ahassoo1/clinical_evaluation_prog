DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… concerning enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a bit strange in my right one too.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. That’s definitely worth getting checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it started… oh, approximately three weeks ago, I believe. It began as a sort of tingling, almost like when your foot falls asleep, but it didn’t go away with movement. Now, it’s more of a consistent numbness, though the intensity fluctuates. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, other days it’s quite pronounced. It seems to be worse after I’ve been on my feet for a long time, or if I’m sitting in one position for too long. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it started about three weeks ago as tingling, progressed to consistent numbness, and is worse with prolonged standing or sitting. You said it fluctuates in intensity. Can you describe where exactly in your left leg you’re feeling the numbness?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a good way to put it. As for the location… it’s primarily in my lower leg, I'd say. Starting just below my knee, down to my foot, and even into my toes sometimes. It’s not just my foot though, it also feels… sort of up my calf. It’s hard to pinpoint precisely, it isn’t a sharp, defined area, but that’s the general region. I can still feel things, it’s just… muted. Like wearing a thick sock, perhaps? Is that a helpful comparison?
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful comparison, actually. "Muted" and like wearing a thick sock gives me a good idea of what you're experiencing. And it’s primarily in your lower leg and foot, extending up the calf. Does it radiate anywhere else – like up into your thigh, or into your back?
PATIENT: No, thankfully it hasn’t radiated further than my calf. It remains localized to my leg, as far as I can tell. I’ve been consciously checking for any sensations in my thigh or back, and I haven't noticed anything unusual there. I did have a slight ache in my lower back a few days ago, but that resolved itself pretty quickly, and I didn't associate it with the numbness at first. It was probably just from lifting something, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it hasn’t radiated. And the back pain sounds like it was likely unrelated. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, or had any previous injuries to your legs or back?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with any medical conditions. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. As for injuries… hmm. I did sprain my ankle, quite badly, when I was about sixteen, playing basketball. But that was a long time ago, and I fully recovered after physical therapy. Aside from that… no, I haven’t had any significant injuries to my legs or back. I’ve always been fairly careful to avoid those sorts of things. I do a fair amount of walking, but nothing too strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical conditions and a history of an ankle sprain that fully resolved. That’s helpful. Do you have any family history of conditions like diabetes, neuropathy, or any neurological disorders?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… My maternal grandmother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. She was diagnosed quite late in life, though. And my uncle on my father's side… he has multiple sclerosis, but it developed when he was in his forties. Aside from those two instances, I don't believe there's any significant family history of neurological disorders or similar conditions. I’m fairly certain, anyway. It’s possible my mother knows more details, but I haven’t specifically asked about it. Would that be relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's definitely relevant, thank you for letting me know. A family history of diabetes and multiple sclerosis is good information to have. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I occasionally drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a weekend, but very rarely. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I've never had any interest in them, to be honest. I prefer a quiet evening at home, reading or working on my projects. I find I focus much better without any substances involved. Is there anything specific you're looking for in terms of lifestyle factors?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use. That's all helpful. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not currently taking any medications, not even over-the-counter ones. I rarely get sick, and when I do, I usually just rest and drink plenty of fluids. I occasionally take a multivitamin, just to supplement my diet, but that’s the only supplement I use. It’s a fairly standard one, nothing specialized. Does that cover everything, Doctor? I’m happy to provide any further information if needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements aside from a standard multivitamin. That's very helpful. Thank you for being so thorough. Alright, Tarin. Based on what you've told me, and reviewing your record, it would be prudent to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. We’ll also do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgement, and I appreciate you taking the time to examine me thoroughly. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do during the examination.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on the examination table, that would be great. We’ll start with your reflexes. I'm going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It shouldn’t be painful, but let me know if it feels uncomfortable. Okay. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished on your left side, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. I'm going to ask you to resist as I try to move your legs in different directions. Just push back against my hand as hard as you can. We'll start with your left leg. Can you point your toes upwards?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, I can point my toes upwards. I’m resisting. Is that sufficient? I’m trying to keep the pressure consistent.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good consistent resistance. It feels… slightly weaker on the left side compared to the right, but not dramatically so. Now, let's check sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your legs and feet with this cotton swab. Just tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes, please. Can you feel this on your left foot?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It’s… a bit muted, perhaps? Not as strong as I’d expect, but definitely present. It feels… distant, almost like feeling it through a layer of fabric. Is that helpful to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. "Distant" is a good description. Okay, and now on your left calf?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that as well. Again, it’s… present, but diminished compared to my right calf. It’s harder to pinpoint the exact location of the sensation. It's… vague. It doesn’t feel sharp, or precise, just… a general awareness of being touched. I hope that’s descriptive enough.
DOCTOR: That's very descriptive, thank you. It sounds like there is decreased sensation in your left leg and foot, consistent with what you’ve been describing. Okay, Tarin. Based on your history and the physical exam, the numbness in your leg could be due to a few things. Peripheral neuropathy is a possibility, and given your family history of diabetes and MS, we need to investigate that further. It could also be related to nerve compression, such as from a pinched nerve in your back or leg. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function. We should also consider an MRI of your lower back to rule out any nerve compression. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I’m happy to proceed with the blood tests and the MRI. I understand the need to investigate the potential causes thoroughly, and I trust your judgement. Please let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for the tests. And if you could explain the process to me beforehand, that would be greatly appreciated. Is there a timeframe for when I should expect the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The blood tests are fairly straightforward. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand – that means no food or sugary drinks. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. The MRI is a bit more involved. You’ll lie inside a large magnet, and it takes about 30-45 minutes. It's important to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, even some types of clothing. We'll give you a detailed list of precautions before the appointment. It is also important you let the technician know if you have any metal implants or a history of claustrophobia. As for the timeframe, the blood test results should be back within a couple of days. The MRI report will take a bit longer, usually 3-5 business days, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Tomorrow morning for the blood tests works well. And I appreciate the detailed explanation of the MRI procedure and the precautions I need to take. I’ll be sure to remove all metal objects and inform the technician of any concerns. I’ll make a note of everything you’ve said. And thank you for outlining the timeframe for the results. I understand it takes time, and I’m happy to be patient. I'm grateful for your thoroughness and your clear explanations. Is there anything else I need to know or do at this time?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could explain everything clearly. For now, there’s not much else you need to do. Just try to avoid any activities that aggravate the numbness. If the numbness worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms – like weakness, pain, or changes in your bowel or bladder function – please contact us immediately. I’ll have the lab requisition and the MRI order ready for you before you leave. And our office will contact you to schedule the MRI appointment once they have availability. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I don’t have any further questions at this time. I really appreciate your time and your patience with me. And thank you again for your clear explanations and your thoughtful approach. I feel much more reassured knowing we're taking these steps to investigate the cause of the numbness. I will be sure to contact the office if anything changes or if I experience any new symptoms. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the meantime. And feel free to contact the office to schedule the MRI appointment whenever you're ready. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up.
