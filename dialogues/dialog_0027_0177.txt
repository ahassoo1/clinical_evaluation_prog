DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. Or, uh… good morning. It's August 2nd, right?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, August. Seems like it. Doctor… Fazzina, you said? I don't really keep track of dates, you know. What was I here for again? Something…down there? It's been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Doctor Fazzina. And… “down there,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, down there. Honestly, Doctor, you’re the one with the papers. I told the nice girl at the front. Something is…leaking. And it smells bad. Not my usual smell, you understand. A bad smell. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Leaking… and a bad odor. I apologize, Mrs. Genard. My memory… isn’t what it used to be. Let’s see… has this been happening for a long time, or is this something new?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How should I know? A few days, maybe? A week? Time just…blurs. It wasn’t happening before, I can tell you that much. It just…started. And it’s not pleasant, I’ll say that for free. Makes me feel…unclean.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few days to a week. And feeling unclean… I understand. Has there been any pain, burning, or itching along with this leaking and odor?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain. More like…a little sore. Like I been sitting too long. And maybe a little itchy sometimes, but mostly just…wet. And smelly! Don't forget smelly, Doctor. It's the smell that's the worst part. I been using extra soap, but it doesn't help. It’s a bad smell, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, soreness and itching, along with the leaking and odor. And the extra soap isn't helping. Hmm. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, frequency, or any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Urine? I go to the bathroom when I need to go, Doctor. Same as always. I don't pay attention to the color of my urine. What kind of a question is that? It looks…yellow, I guess. It burns sometimes, now that you mention it. But I drink a lot of coffee. Maybe that's why?
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, possibly related to coffee… We should rule out a urinary tract infection, just to be safe. And to get a better understanding, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just an external exam, nothing invasive at this point. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: An exam? What kind of exam? You're not going to… poke around, are you? I don’t like the sound of that. I just want you to maybe give me something to make it stop leaking and smelling. I don't need you looking at…down there. It’s embarrassing enough as it is, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mrs. Genard. Truly. It would be a very quick, external exam only. Just to visually assess the area and rule out anything obvious. No internal exam at all, I promise. If we can't figure out what’s going on without a closer look, we can discuss other options, including a referral to a specialist. But sometimes, a quick look can save a lot of worry. I will document everything, of course. Would you be willing to let me take a look?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose. But quick, Doctor. Very quick. And no touching! Just look. And explain what you’re looking at. I don’t want any surprises. And be gentle, alright? I’m an old woman. Hurry up, then. This is dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Genard. Very quick, external exam only, and I’ll explain everything as I go. I promise to be gentle. Alright. I’m just looking at the area now… I see some mild redness, and there’s a small amount of discharge. It doesn’t seem to be a major inflammation, but it is enough to cause concern. I don't see any obvious sores or blisters. Do you have any history of sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Sexually… what now?! Doctor, are you accusing me of something? I am a respectable woman! I haven’t… well, it’s none of your business, really. That is a very rude question. I’ve lived a good life, thank you very much. What kind of a doctor asks such a thing?! Honestly. This is outrageous!
DOCTOR: Oh, Mrs. Genard, I apologize profusely! That was a very insensitive question, and I did not mean to offend you. I was simply going through a standard list of potential causes, and I should have phrased it much more carefully. Please accept my sincerest apologies. It was not my intention to imply anything at all. Let’s forget I asked that. We can explore other possibilities. Have you recently changed any soaps, detergents, or feminine hygiene products?
PATIENT: Well… I did try a new laundry detergent. A fancy one, with aloe vera. My granddaughter recommended it. Said it was better for sensitive skin. But it didn't smell very good, now that I think about it. Sort of…chemical-y. Could that be it? It’s probably just something silly. Though it's been a week, hasn't it? Wouldn’t it have gone away by now?
DOCTOR: That’s very possible, Mrs. Genard. Sometimes, a change in products can cause irritation and lead to these symptoms. A week is certainly long enough for that to be a factor. It’s good you mentioned that. To be on the safe side, I think it would be best to collect a urine sample to rule out an infection. Then, I’d like to recommend a simple cream to soothe the irritation, just in case it is a reaction to the new detergent. If the symptoms don’t improve within a few days, we can discuss further testing or a referral to a gynecologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A cream sounds good. And a pee test… well, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I don't have all day, you know. Is it one of those little cups? I always make a mess with those things. Honestly, this whole thing is just…a nuisance. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s a small cup. And don’t worry about making a mess. We have plenty. I’ll give you a cup and instructions, and I’ll step out while you collect the sample to give you some privacy. Once you’re finished, just leave it on the counter, and I’ll take it to the lab. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just…don't rush me. And try not to listen, alright? This is embarrassing enough as it is. Honestly, doctors these days… .
