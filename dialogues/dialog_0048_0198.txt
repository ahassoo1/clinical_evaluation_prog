DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Sink. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m Liza, by the way. Liza Sugino. I’ve been thinking about trying mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I just… feel like I need to find a way to be a little calmer, you know? My job… it can be stressful, making sure everything runs smoothly with the trains.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, mindfulness. I… I don’t really know how to do it properly, that’s the truth of it. I’ve heard it helps with stress, and focusing… and I think I could really use some help with both of those things. I read a little online, but it all seemed… complicated, and I wasn’t sure where to start. It’s just… a lot of thinking for someone who needs to stop thinking so much, if that makes sense!
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you’re consulting a physician about…stress management techniques?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, dear. I… I didn’t mean to waste your time, Doctor. Is that… not something you usually help with? I just thought… well, you are a doctor. And I figured it was better to ask a professional than to just keep reading random things on the internet. I apologize if it’s silly. Perhaps I should have gone somewhere else?
DOCTOR: “Silly” isn’t quite the word. Inefficient, perhaps. Look, I specialize in internal medicine. We deal with…organ systems. Blood pressure, cholesterol, things that can kill you. Not…emotional wellbeing. Although, I suppose chronic stress can contribute to hypertension, eventually. Do you have high blood pressure, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thankfully not. Last time I checked, it was perfectly normal. My mother… she had some problems with that, later in life, which is why I keep an eye on it. But no, nothing like that right now. I just… I guess I was hoping you might know of a good class, or… a resource? Someone who does specialize in helping people with… calming down, I suppose. I feel a bit foolish now, asking you directly.
DOCTOR: There are…community centers. Perhaps a yoga class?
PATIENT: Yoga… hmm. I’ve thought about yoga. I’m not very flexible, though, and I worry I’d just embarrass myself. But community centers… that’s a good idea. I hadn’t really considered that. Do you happen to know if there are any reputable ones around here? I live just outside of town, near the old railway depot, so something not too far would be ideal. I'm not very good with the internet, so finding things online is a bit of a struggle.
DOCTOR: Honestly, Ms. Sugino, I don't keep a directory of local recreational activities. I'm a doctor. Perhaps the library could assist you with finding resources. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Right, of course. A doctor. I’m sorry to bother you with this. No, nothing else. No headaches, no trouble sleeping… just… a lot of thoughts. A lot of worrying. I guess that’s not a symptom, is it? It just feels… tiring. I thought maybe mindfulness would help me quiet things down a bit, so I could focus better at work. We have a lot of responsibility, making sure the signals are right and the tracks are safe. It’s… important work. But it’s easier when my brain isn’t racing. I think that’s all. Truly. I apologize again for taking up your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, before you leave, let’s just do a basic run-through. Any family history of heart disease, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… My grandfather, on my mother’s side, had a stroke, quite a long time ago, when he was very old. And my aunt, her sister, she has type 2 diabetes. She manages it with diet and medication, thankfully. As for heart disease… not that I know of, specifically. My father was very healthy, until the very end, and my mother… her heart gave out, eventually, but that was after years of high blood pressure, like I said. Is that helpful? I'm not sure what you're looking for, exactly. I can always ask my sister, she’s very organized and keeps track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I’m very lucky, I’ve always been quite healthy. Just a multivitamin every now and then, if I remember. I try to eat well, mostly vegetables and lean protein. I do enjoy a good pastry now and again, though! My sister always tells me I need to cut back on the sweets. But really, nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just the occasional vitamin. I do use a cream for my hands, the work is quite rough on them, but that’s not a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Sugino, everything seems… within normal limits. I suggest you continue monitoring your blood pressure and diet, and perhaps consider a stress-reduction technique, as you mentioned. If you develop any concerning symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headaches – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Sink, for your time. And… for not completely dismissing me. I apologize again for taking up your afternoon with my… non-medical concerns. I’ll look into the community centers, and maybe ask my sister about a good yoga instructor. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You too. .
