DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, I don't usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. But this…this is strange. About a week ago, I had a nasty cold – just the usual stuffy nose and sore throat. It cleared up fine, but now… my legs. They feel like jelly, honestly. Just…weak. Both of them. It’s quite inconvenient, you understand. I’m a tour guide, so I do a lot of walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness in both legs after a cold… that is inconvenient, especially with your job. Let’s get a bit more detail about this. When you say “like jelly”, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s…hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. It's like… trying to walk through water. Everything feels… heavy. And it takes real effort to lift my feet. Like they don't want to cooperate. It started gradually, maybe three days ago. I thought it was just lingering effects of the cold, but it hasn't gotten better. Actually, it’s a little worse today. I had to practically drag myself out of bed this morning. It’s just… not normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” and needing effort to lift your feet – that's helpful. And it’s gradually worsened over the last three days, despite resting. Has this weakness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. It’s not like I can suddenly leap and bound, but it's always there, a dull ache and this… reluctance, you know? Though, it is a bit worse at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet. I tried to do a shorter tour yesterday, thinking it would help, but it didn’t really make a difference. Honestly, I'm starting to worry it's something serious. I've never experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let's go through a bit more of your history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Definitely not. Just…weakness. And a bit of stiffness sometimes, but mostly weakness. It’s not like they’re falling asleep, or anything like that. I've always had good circulation, as far as I know. My mother always said I had strong legs, even when I was a child. This is just… perplexing. I’m usually very active, very healthy. I eat well, I get plenty of exercise. It doesn't make any sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, and you generally consider yourself very healthy. That’s good information. Now, thinking back, have you had any fever, chills, or body aches with the cold or after it resolved?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, with the cold, definitely. A proper fever, you know, had to take something for it. And body aches, of course – the usual with a cold. But that all cleared up with the cold. The fever broke, the aches stopped, and then… this started. It wasn’t connected to the cold while I was sick, it started after I started feeling better. Maybe a day or two after, I'd say. It was a gradual thing, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fever and body aches during the cold, but those resolved before the leg weakness began. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel function?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you asking me if I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom? With all due respect, what does that have to do with weak legs? I had a cold! It's hardly a delicate topic, you know. But no, everything is… normal. Perfectly normal. I'm not going to elaborate further. I find the question rather inappropriate, frankly.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question that. It was a standard question to rule out some neurological possibilities, and I apologize if it felt inappropriate or intrusive. We don’t need to go into detail, and I should have explained that better. Let’s move on. Now, have you had any recent injuries, even minor ones, to your legs or back?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a relief. I was starting to think you were trying to… never mind. And no, no injuries. I haven't fallen or bumped into anything. I'm rather careful, you know. I walk a lot, but I'm not clumsy. I haven't done anything strenuous, haven’t lifted anything heavy. I haven't been doing anything different, really. That’s what’s so baffling about this. It just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injuries. And it came on gradually without any specific event. Now, do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. My blood pressure is usually a bit high, but nothing the doctor hasn't warned me about – I try to keep an eye on it. And I was divorced a few years ago, if that counts as a medical condition. Aside from that, I’m perfectly healthy. Mostly. It's just this leg weakness. It’s really throwing me off.
DOCTOR: Divorce certainly can be stressful. But let’s focus on the medical side. You mentioned high blood pressure, are you currently taking any medications for that or any other condition?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure. And sometimes ibuprofen, if my arthritis flares up. But that's it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a pill-popper. I prefer to take care of myself naturally. I eat a healthy diet, I get plenty of exercise – or I did, before my legs decided to stop cooperating. And I’m very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can take most things without a problem. I'm not one of those people with a long list of sensitivities. And I don't wear any jewelry, so no metal allergies, either. Really, I’m quite a straightforward case, usually. It’s just this… perplexing leg weakness. I'm starting to worry it’s something really serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you generally consider yourself healthy, despite the blood pressure and arthritis. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Would you mind if I checked your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. But don't expect much, I'm telling you. My legs aren't cooperating at all. Honestly, it’s rather frustrating. I’m a very active person. I’m used to being able to do things. This is just… humiliating. But yes, you may examine them. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, I will. Let's start with your reflexes... Okay, reflexes are a bit diminished, but not absent. Now, I'm going to check the strength of your legs. Could you please try to push your foot against my hand?
PATIENT: Alright. Push against your hand... It feels like pushing against a wall, honestly. Everything feels so…heavy. Is this normal? It's not exactly resisting, is it? I’m trying, Doctor, really I am. But it’s like there’s something… blocking the effort. It’s just…weak. Not like a sudden pain, just…gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re right, there is noticeable weakness in both legs compared to what I'd expect. And it seems symmetrical – the weakness is about the same on both sides. Now, I’m going to check sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel me touching your feet with this?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I can feel that. Perfectly normal. Not numb, not tingling, just…feel it. Like you said, both sides are the same. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all very frustrating. I’m perfectly aware of my body, and something is definitely wrong. It’s not a figment of my imagination.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, and I appreciate you being so clear about what you're feeling. Okay, based on the exam, we’ve got some noticeable weakness in both legs that's symmetrical, with normal reflexes and sensation. This, combined with your recent cold, is pointing me in a few potential directions. One possibility is something called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is a rare but serious condition that can cause weakness after an infection. Another is a more common condition like post-viral weakness, though this usually resolves more quickly. To be certain, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers. I also recommend an MRI of your spine to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Guillain-what-now? Sounds terrifying. And an MRI? I'm rather claustrophobic, you know. Honestly, I was hoping for something simple, like a vitamin deficiency. Something I could fix with a pill or two. This sounds very serious, and frankly, I'm not sure I like it. Are you certain this is necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be… a lingering effect of the cold?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and you’re right to be cautious. Guillain-Barré syndrome is serious, but it’s also relatively rare. Ordering these tests isn’t necessarily saying that's what you have, it’s simply ruling things out and getting a clearer picture of what’s going on. The tests will help us determine the cause of your weakness and guide the appropriate treatment. As for the MRI, we can discuss options for managing your claustrophobia. Sometimes medication can help, and we can also do a shorter scan if that’s more comfortable. Let me explain why I'm considering these tests. Post-viral weakness is definitely a possibility, but given the symmetry of your weakness and the persistence of the symptoms, I want to be thorough. The blood work will help rule out other causes, like vitamin deficiencies or inflammation, and the MRI will help rule out any structural problems in your spine that could be contributing to your weakness. Does that sound more reasonable?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. If you think it's necessary. But I still think it's excessive. And I expect a full explanation of everything, in language I can understand, before you start sticking needles in me or putting me in a giant machine. No medical jargon, alright? I'm a tour guide, not a doctor. And what about the results? How long will it take? And what if it is something serious? I have tours booked for the next month, people are relying on me. I can't just… disappear.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand your concerns about your tours and needing a clear explanation. I promise no medical jargon – I'll explain everything in plain language. And I’ll be sure to answer all of your questions thoroughly. The blood work should be back within a couple of days. The MRI will take a little longer, usually around three to five business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If it turns out to be something serious, we'll discuss all of your treatment options and create a plan that works best for you. We can also discuss accommodations for your tours if needed, and I can provide a note for your employers if you need time off. To start, I'll order the blood work and schedule the MRI. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, which is sometimes used in MRIs?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? I… don’t think so. I've never had an MRI before, so I wouldn’t know. I'm usually very careful about what I put into my body, so if I had an allergy, I’d probably know. But no, as far as I’m aware, I don't have any allergies. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very overwhelming. I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s overwhelming, and you’re right to feel that way. I want to assure you we'll take things one step at a time. Let's get the tests scheduled, and we'll address any concerns as they arise. Alright, I’ll write the orders for the blood work and the MRI. The receptionist will schedule the MRI for you when you check out. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the scan. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Here are the orders. I’m also going to give you a handout with some general information about weakness and some things you can do in the meantime, like gentle stretching and avoiding strenuous activity. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Gentle stretching… Honestly. Well, I suppose it's better than nothing. Thank you, Doctor. I still think it's a bit excessive, but I appreciate you explaining things. And please, no medical jargon in the follow-up. I expect a clear explanation, in language I can understand. I suppose I’ll go schedule the MRI. And I really hope this doesn't take too long. I have tours to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Clear language is my promise. And I’ll do my best to get the process moving as quickly as possible. If you have any trouble scheduling the MRI or have any questions before your appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Please keep me updated, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up. Take care, Sharifa. And try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together.
