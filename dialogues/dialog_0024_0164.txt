DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. But I’ve been feeling really weak and…yellow, for a few days now. It started after I had some fava beans. I love them, but… it seems to happen every time I eat them.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I know it sounds strange. My grandmother used to make a wonderful stew with them, and I always enjoyed it. But the last few times I’ve had them, I just feel awful afterwards. Really tired, and my skin and eyes started looking… yellow. Like I said, it's embarrassing, but I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s always best to be cautious. And while I find it…unusual…to attribute such symptoms to a legume, we shall investigate. Let's begin with a more detailed history, if you please. When precisely did these symptoms begin after consuming the fava beans?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The first time I noticed it was maybe a week ago. I had the beans on a Tuesday, and by Thursday I was feeling really sluggish and my wife pointed out I looked a bit pale. Then the yellowing started, maybe Friday. It wasn't dramatic at first, just… noticeable. This time, it was quicker. I had them Sunday, and felt bad by Tuesday. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is…recorded. And how much of these fava beans are you consuming each time?
PATIENT: Oh, not a huge amount, I don't think. Maybe a cup, cooked? I usually have them as a side dish with dinner. Not a whole meal of them, just… a good serving. My grandmother always made a big batch, so I suppose I eat a decent portion when they’re available.
DOCTOR: A “decent portion” is rather vague, Ms. Haggar. We require precision in medical evaluations. Approximately how many grams would you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Grams… I really don't know, Doctor. I’m not good with measurements. I suppose… maybe 150 grams? It’s a guess, truly. They come pre-cooked in a container, and I just… scoop out a good amount. It fills a regular-sized cup, if that helps at all. I’m sorry I can’t be more precise. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is always important, Ms. Haggar. Now, let's move on. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the weakness and…jaundice?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Thinking about it, I have been feeling a bit short of breath lately, especially when I walk up the stairs. And… my urine has been quite dark, almost brown. I thought it was just from not drinking enough water, but now that you mention it, it started around the same time as the other things. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, but that's come and gone.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, shortness of breath… very well. And have you noticed any abdominal pain, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: No, no abdominal pain. Nothing like that at all. I’ve been a little nauseous a couple of times, but it’s not severe. Just… a bit queasy. And honestly, I've just been feeling so tired, it's hard to notice much else. Like a really bad flu, without the fever.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Haggar, I need to ask some questions regarding your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing chronic. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that. And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that’s it, really. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no heart problems. My doctor always said I had a strong constitution. Until this, of course.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had some problems with her gallbladder, I think. She needed surgery for it when she was older. And my father… he had high cholesterol, I believe. But nothing major, really. No one in my family has ever had anything like this happen – getting sick from food or anything. It’s quite strange, honestly. It’s why I feel a bit silly coming to you with this.
DOCTOR: "Silly," Ms. Haggar, is not a medical term. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but that's it. And I haven't taken anything for this, hoping it would just go away on its own. It hasn't, obviously. So, here I am. Do you think it is the fava beans? It just seems… odd.
DOCTOR: Ms. Haggar, while I appreciate your…natural inclinations, dismissing potential medical concerns is not advisable. Based on your symptoms – weakness, jaundice, dark urine, shortness of breath – and your history of correlation with fava bean consumption, we must consider a possible diagnosis of Favism. It is a genetic deficiency, often manifesting with exposure to certain triggers. However, we require further investigation. I will need to conduct a physical examination and order some blood tests to confirm this suspicion. Now, please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Favism? I’ve never heard of that. Is it… serious? And is it… hereditary? Should my children be worried? I'm starting to feel a bit anxious now, Doctor. A genetic deficiency… that sounds quite frightening. I just wanted to know why I feel sick after eating beans!
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Haggar, allow me to conduct the examination first. Unnecessary anxiety will not assist in our diagnosis. We will discuss potential hereditary implications after we have conclusive results. Now, if you would please cooperate. Let's begin with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think that's best. But… could you maybe explain a little bit about what Favism is while you examine me? Just so I have some idea of what we're looking for. It might help me relax a little. I don't like feeling like I'm in the dark about things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Favism is a genetic condition where individuals lack a sufficient amount of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, or G6PD. This enzyme is crucial for protecting red blood cells from damage. When exposed to certain triggers – like fava beans, certain medications, or infections – red blood cells break down prematurely, leading to a condition called hemolytic anemia. This explains your weakness, jaundice, and dark urine. It is X-linked, meaning it primarily affects males, though females can be carriers. Now, please lie back. We will assess your heart sounds first. Do you have any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Just… a little breathless sometimes, like I said. And a bit dizzy. X-linked… so my son could be affected? He's very active, plays a lot of sports. Oh dear… This is much more worrying than I thought. What kind of treatment is there? Can it be cured? I'm sorry, I'm probably asking too many questions. It’s just… it's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are… regular, though slightly tachycardic. As for treatment, Favism is typically managed with supportive care - hydration, rest, and avoidance of triggers. Transfusions may be necessary in severe cases. There is no cure, Ms. Haggar, but with proper management, individuals can live relatively normal lives. As for your son, he would require testing to determine his status. Now, take a deep breath… and exhale. Let’s examine your abdomen. Do you experience any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little tender, actually. Not painful, just… sensitive. It’s probably just from being nervous, though. I tend to tense up when I’m at the doctor. I don’t like being poked and prodded. But… yes, definitely a little sensitive there, on the right side. Is that normal for Favism? I feel like I’m just adding to the list of things that are wrong with me. It’s probably just indigestion from worrying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant… This warrants further investigation. Your liver may be enlarged. While Favism itself doesn't typically cause significant liver involvement, it’s crucial to rule out other potential causes. Now, I am going to listen to your lungs. Please take deep breaths through your mouth. In… and out…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. inhales deeply, exhales with a slight wheeze… I do feel a little tight in my chest, sometimes. Like I said, breathless when I walk up the stairs. I thought it was just getting old, to be honest. I haven't been as active lately. Is the liver thing serious? Could it be something else entirely? I'm starting to feel quite scared now. I just wanted to know why I can't eat fava beans, not… all of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Haggar, based on my examination and your reported symptoms, while Favism remains a strong possibility, we must also investigate the possibility of underlying liver dysfunction. Your symptoms—fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, abdominal tenderness, shortness of breath—could indicate a more complex issue. Therefore, I am ordering a comprehensive blood panel, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay. I will also order an abdominal ultrasound to assess the condition of your liver and gallbladder. We need to rule out other potential causes, such as hepatitis, gallstones, or other liver diseases. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. So… more tests. And… possibly other things besides the Favism. It’s just… a lot to take in. Hepatitis, gallstones… it sounds very serious. When will I get the results? And… what happens if it is something else? I’m really starting to worry now. Will I need surgery? Or… something worse? I just want to feel better, and I feel like this is just getting more complicated. .
DOCTOR: The blood tests and ultrasound will be processed as quickly as possible, Ms. Haggar. You can expect the results within 48-72 hours. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. As for your concerns regarding surgery or more serious conditions, it is premature to speculate at this stage. We must await the results of the tests before making any definitive conclusions. Do you have any further questions at this moment?
