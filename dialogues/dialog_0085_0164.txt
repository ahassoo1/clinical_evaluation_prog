DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired and yellow, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It's been happening a few times now, and I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit strange. Tired and yellow… and it seems connected to eating fava beans. That's helpful information. When you say yellow, do you mean your skin is looking yellow, or are you experiencing yellowing in your eyes?
PATIENT: Mostly my skin, I think. And… yes, a little in my eyes too, now that you mention it. It’s not super noticeable, but I can see it when I look in the mirror. It's hard to explain, it's just… a sort of pale yellow colour. It goes away after a while, when I stop eating the beans.
DOCTOR: Okay, pale yellow skin and a little yellowing in your eyes… and it resolves when you avoid fava beans. That's very specific. How long after eating the beans does the yellowing typically start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually within a day or so, I’d say. Sometimes it's quicker, maybe even the same day, but generally within 24 hours of eating them. And it takes a few days to completely go away once I stop eating them. It’s just… worrying, you know? I like fava beans!
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it's good you're getting this checked out. It's definitely unusual to have a reaction like that specifically to fava beans. We need to explore this a bit further. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually… now that you ask. Sometimes I feel a bit weak, like I have no energy at all. And… I’ve been a little short of breath too, if I do anything too strenuous. It’s not a constant thing, but it happens. And maybe a little dizzy sometimes, but I thought that was just from being tired. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. Weakness, shortness of breath, and dizziness alongside the yellowing and connection to fava beans… it’s starting to paint a clearer picture. Do you have any family history of anemia, or any blood disorders?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother… she had some problems with feeling tired all the time, but I don’t know if it was ever properly diagnosed. Just always felt run down, she said. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had something with his spleen, I think. But I honestly don’t know much about it. They didn’t really talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of fatigue in your mother and a spleen issue in your grandfather… that's helpful to know. Now, have you ever been told you were anemic, or had low iron levels?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. I’ve had regular check-ups with my doctor back in Romania, but I don’t remember anything about anemia specifically. They usually just checked my blood pressure and things like that. I don’t think they ever did any detailed blood tests. I’ve only been seeing doctors here for a few years, and this is the first time I’ve felt the need to come in about something.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your symptoms – the tiredness, yellowing, connection to fava beans, and family history – I’m concerned about the possibility of G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition that can cause these kinds of reactions. To confirm this, we’ll need to do a blood test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency? I’ve never heard of that. It sounds… serious. If that’s what it is, what does that mean? And yes, a blood test is fine. Whatever we need to do to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel better. Is it… contagious? Sorry, I just ask a lot of questions!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, it's good you ask questions! It’s not contagious, no. It's a genetic condition, meaning it's inherited, not something you catch from someone else. G6PD deficiency means your body doesn't have enough of an enzyme called G6PD, which protects your red blood cells. When you're exposed to certain triggers, like fava beans in your case, it can cause your red blood cells to break down faster, leading to anemia, which explains the tiredness, weakness, and yellowing. It's usually not life-threatening, but it's important to know about it so you can avoid triggers. We’ll run the test to confirm, and if it is G6PD deficiency, we'll discuss how to manage it. Okay, I’m going to order some blood work now, including a complete blood count and a G6PD enzyme level. I'll also check your bilirubin levels, as that can help us understand the cause of the yellowing. Would you like to sit in the waiting room while the lab draws your blood?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Not contagious, that's good. And avoiding fava beans… I can definitely do that! I’m happy to avoid them if that's what it takes. Yes, please, let’s do the blood tests. Waiting in the waiting room is fine. How long will it take, roughly? And will I get the results today? I’m a bit anxious, if you don't mind me saying. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Lahn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. The lab usually takes about an hour or two to process the results, but it can sometimes take longer depending on how busy they are. I’m hoping we’ll have something back by the end of the day, but it’s possible we might have to wait until tomorrow. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. Once I have the results, I’ll review them and let you know what we find. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re doing everything we can to figure out what’s going on. Do you have any other questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much, Dr. Lahn. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I’ll just sit in the waiting room and try to relax. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Wonderful. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns while you wait. .
