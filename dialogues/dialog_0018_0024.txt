DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s a bit of a long story, but I’m hoping you can help.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. I can assist with that. A letter confirming your fitness to fly. To ensure I can provide an accurate and appropriate document, could you please tell me a bit more about why you require this confirmation?
PATIENT: Well, my husband… he passed away a few months ago. We had a trip planned to visit my sister in Mongolia, tickets and everything. The airline is being difficult about a refund, or letting me transfer the ticket to someone else. They said they need a doctor’s note stating he wasn’t… you know, seriously ill when we booked, and that I’m fit to travel now. It’s all very frustrating, honestly. They’re worried about liability, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. That sounds incredibly difficult, and the airline's request is… unfortunate, given the circumstances. I am very sorry for your loss. It’s perfectly reasonable they would require documentation. To best fulfill their request, could you tell me when approximately you booked the trip and when your husband passed away?
PATIENT: We booked the tickets on February 15th of this year – 2025. And he… he passed away on April 28th. So, about three months ago. Everything was fine when we booked, perfectly healthy. He just… had a heart attack unexpectedly. It was very sudden.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sayar. That’s very helpful. And just to clarify, prior to April 28th, was your husband under the care of a physician for any cardiac issues or other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not at all. He was a very healthy man. He went for a check-up every year, and everything was always good. No high blood pressure, no cholesterol problems, nothing. He was active, ate well… it really was a shock to everyone. That’s why it’s so ridiculous they’re questioning things now.
DOCTOR: I completely agree, Ms. Sayar. It sounds as though his passing was truly unexpected, and the airline's request is particularly insensitive given those circumstances. Now, shifting focus to you, are you currently experiencing any health issues that might prevent you from traveling?
PATIENT: No, I’m fine, thank you. A little… sad, obviously. And tired. But physically, I’m perfectly healthy. No problems at all that would stop me from flying. I’ve been walking every day, trying to keep my strength up. I just want to go see my sister, it’s been so long.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Sayar. It’s important to prioritize your well-being, and staying active is an excellent step. To complete the documentation for the airline, would you mind if I briefly review your medical history in our system?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. Please do. I don’t think there will be much there, honestly. Just routine things. I’ve mostly just seen a doctor for check-ups and the occasional cold. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sayar. As you mentioned, your record indicates a history of routine care with no significant medical concerns. This confirms what you’ve told me. I’m happy to prepare a letter stating that you are medically fit to travel. I will include that your husband had no known pre-existing conditions at the time of booking the tickets, and that you are currently in good health. Would you like me to print that out for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be wonderful. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate it. Hopefully this will finally get things sorted out with the airline.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. Here are two copies of the letter. One for your records, and one to submit to the airline. It states your medical fitness to fly, as well as your husband’s health status at the time of booking. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Honestly, you’ve been a lifesaver. Thank you again for your time and help, Doctor Stilaire. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I was happy to help in any way I could. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. I wish you safe travels when you are able to visit your sister. And please, take good care of yourself. Have a good day, Ms. Sayar. .
