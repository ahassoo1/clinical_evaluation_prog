DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Oh dear… what brings me in… Now, let me see. It’s this pain, you see. Quite severe, lower down. It comes and goes, but… well, it’s been troubling me. I believe it has something to do with… the lupus, perhaps? I’ve had it for quite some time. It’s all a bit… hazy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain… lower abdomen, coming and going. And you suspect it might be related to your lupus. You've been dealing with lupus for a while, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, quite some time. Decades, I should think. Though… the specifics escape me. I remember doctors, of course, and treatments… but the timeline… it’s all a bit blurred. It’s frustrating, I know. I apologize for being so… vague. It's just how my memory is these days. Is it alright if I just describe the pain as best I can, and perhaps you can guide me with questions?
DOCTOR: Of course, Alese. That's perfectly alright. Don't apologize at all. We'll take it slow and I’ll ask questions to help clarify things. Describe the pain to me – where exactly is it located, and what does it feel like?
PATIENT: Well… it's mostly right here, low down, in the center. Sometimes it feels like a… a cramping, you know? Like a very strong period pain, but… not regular. And other times, it’s more of a… a deep ache. It’s hard to explain. It comes in waves, really. And it can be quite sharp at times, almost like… tearing, but not constantly. Does that make any sense at all? I’m terribly sorry for being so imprecise.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower central abdomen, cramping and a deep ache, coming and going in waves. Sharp, tearing pain sometimes. It sounds… complex. And when did you first notice this particular flare-up, or change in your pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… now that is a difficult question. It feels… recent, but… recent could mean weeks, or even a month or two. My recall isn’t what it once was, I’m afraid. I believe it started gradually, a slight discomfort that slowly worsened. I honestly can't pinpoint a specific date. Perhaps it was after… after that visit with Dr. Chen? She adjusted my medication, I think. Though, I can’t be certain. Everything just… blends together, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, potentially within the last couple of months, and possibly after a medication adjustment with Dr. Chen. We can look at your records to see what was changed then. Aside from the pain, have you noticed any other changes – any fever, nausea, vomiting, changes in your bowel movements, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, I don’t think. I haven’t been feeling particularly warm. And no vomiting, thankfully. But… …my appetite has been a bit off. Not much hunger, really. And… yes, actually. My bowel movements have been… irregular. A bit… loose, sometimes. Not always, but frequently enough to notice. It’s not severe, mind you, but… different than usual. I hadn’t connected it to the pain, but now that you mention it… perhaps it’s related. Everything feels connected, somehow, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and irregular bowel movements – loose stools – along with the pain. That's helpful. Now, regarding your lupus, are you currently taking any medications specifically for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I am. Let me think… I believe it's… Plaquenil, yes. And… a low dose of prednisone, sometimes. Dr. Chen adjusted the prednisone, as I mentioned. I think it's still a low dose, but… I honestly can’t recall the exact amount. I have a list at home, I’m sure, but… it didn’t occur to me to bring it. I am terribly disorganized, you see. Do you need the specifics? I could have my daughter send them over, perhaps? She's very good with such things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Alese. Don’t worry about it. It’s helpful to know you’re on Plaquenil and occasionally prednisone. We can access your medication list through the system here, so you don't need to worry about having your daughter send anything. Okay… yes, here we are. Plaquenil 200mg daily and prednisone 5mg as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another thing I struggle with remembering. I think I had a mild reaction to… an antibiotic, many years ago. A rash, I believe. But it was so long ago, and… it wasn't severe. I’m not certain which antibiotic it was, unfortunately. And I haven’t had any reactions to the Plaquenil or prednisone, thankfully. I’m generally… resilient, I suppose. Though, perhaps that’s just my optimistic nature speaking.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild reaction to an antibiotic in the past, but no known allergies to Plaquenil or prednisone. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your abdomen, and feel for any tenderness. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, do whatever you need to do. And… yes, please do let me know if anything causes discomfort. I don't want to be… stoic, if that makes sense. I'll try to be as communicative as possible, despite my… fuzziness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese. If you could lie back for me, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Sounds are… normal, no unusual bruits or murmurs. And now I’m just going to feel for any tenderness. Hmm. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower central abdomen, as you mentioned. Not severe, but noticeable. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Okay, all right. That’s consistent with what you’ve been describing.
PATIENT: Yes… that’s… that’s where it hurts. Not excruciating, but… definitely tender. A dull ache, mostly. It’s worse when I… when I press on it, naturally. And it seems to radiate… slightly, to my lower back. Does that make sense? I’m trying to be precise, Doctor, but… it’s difficult to pinpoint. It’s more of a… a general discomfort, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower central abdomen, radiating to the lower back. That's helpful. Given your history of lupus and the symptoms you’re describing—the pain, decreased appetite, and irregular bowel movements—there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a lupus flare affecting your digestive system, or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. A complete blood count to check for inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your organ function, and a stool test to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and a stool test. Thorough. I appreciate your… diligence, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. Whatever you think is best. Though… will the blood tests be extensive? I do get a bit… faint, sometimes, with needles. And the stool test… well, it's not the most pleasant topic, is it? But, if it’s necessary, then of course. I apologize for my… anxieties. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. We'll take things slow. The blood tests are fairly standard – a few vials of blood. And we can make the stool test as comfortable as possible – you'll receive instructions for collecting a sample at home. It's not pleasant, no, but it provides valuable information. We'll start with the blood tests, and then we can discuss the stool test in more detail. I'll also order a urinalysis, just to rule out a urinary tract infection, as that can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Blood tests, urinalysis, and… the stool test. I trust your assessment. And if I do think of anything, I will be sure to ask. Perhaps my daughter will have questions as well, she's very good with medical things. It's just… a bit unsettling, realizing something is amiss. But I am grateful for your attention, Doctor. And for your… patience with my forgetfulness. It’s a constant struggle, you see. So… what happens next? Do I need to schedule another appointment? Or will you contact me with the results?
DOCTOR: We’ll get those tests ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will help you with the collection process. As for what happens next, I'll review the results as soon as they come back – usually within a few days. I’ll then contact you directly to discuss them and formulate a plan. Depending on the results, that plan might involve medication adjustments, further testing, or a referral to a specialist. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. If you experience any worsening pain, fever, nausea, or significant changes in your bowel movements, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. I want to ensure you are comfortable and receive the best possible care. And don’t worry about your memory – we’ll take all the time you need.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That sounds… very reassuring. Worsening pain, fever, nausea… I will keep that in mind. And I truly appreciate your patience. I believe that is all for now, then? I shall head down to the lab. Thank you again, Doctor Fazzina. And… have a good day.
