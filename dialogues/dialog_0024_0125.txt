DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I just… wanted to get checked. For, you know… the HIV. Better safe than sorry, I always say. Though honestly, I doubt it’ll be anything. I’m a pretty careful guy.
DOCTOR: "Careful," you say. While commendable, that is hardly a substitute for a proper medical assessment. Very well. To clarify, you are requesting an HIV test?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A test. To confirm everything is fine. I mean, it’s just good practice, right? Some people don’t bother, but I like to know these things. It's just... sensible. You’ve got to be on top of these things, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Sensible, perhaps. Although, preventative medicine is best implemented with a comprehensive understanding of risk factors. Have you engaged in any behaviors that would necessitate such testing?
PATIENT: Behaviors? Look, Doctor, I'm married. Been married for eight years. What kind of question is that? I’m not… one of those people. It’s just a routine check. Honestly, I find that a little insulting. I’m just being responsible. Are you suggesting something?
DOCTOR: I am merely attempting to gather a complete medical history, Mr. Belan. A responsible approach includes transparency. Nevertheless, if you insist on proceeding without providing further information... We can certainly proceed with the test. However, please understand that a negative result is only truly meaningful when considered in the context of potential exposures. Do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. No allergies, and I take… just a daily multivitamin. That’s it. Nothing else. Look, I just want the test, Doctor. I don’t see why we’re going around in circles here. Are you going to do it or not? I've got things to do this afternoon, you know. It's not like I'm asking for open-heart surgery.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the HIV antibody test. It involves a simple blood draw. I must inform you that initial results will take approximately 20 minutes to process here in the clinic. If that is acceptable?
PATIENT: Twenty minutes? Fine. As long as it’s just that. I really don’t have all day. Is there somewhere I can… sit? Preferably not near anyone… you know, just in case. Though I doubt anyone here would be… exposed, anyway. Just a preference.
DOCTOR: You may take a seat in the waiting room. I will call you when the results are available. Please refrain from discussing your medical concerns with other patients. And, frankly, your concerns regarding "exposure" are unnecessary. This is a medical facility. We maintain appropriate standards of confidentiality and hygiene.
PATIENT: Right. Of course. Standards. Honestly, some people… it’s just common sense. Some of us actually care about these things.
DOCTOR: Common sense… indeed. I’ll be with you shortly. Do not leave the premises before I have provided you with the results.
PATIENT: Of course not! What do you take me for? I’m not going anywhere. I just want to get this over with and prove that everything is perfectly fine. Honestly, the implication is… quite rude.
DOCTOR: The results are back, Mr. Belan. The initial HIV antibody test is… negative. However, as I previously explained, a single negative test does not entirely rule out the possibility of infection, particularly if you have engaged in any recent risky behaviors. This test detects antibodies, which take time to develop. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Of course I understand. You’ve said it about a million times. Negative. Perfectly negative. And I told you, I don’t engage in “risky behaviors”. What exactly are you implying now? Honestly, this is bordering on harassment. I came here for peace of mind, and all I’ve gotten is… judgment. So, can I go now? I have a life, you know. A perfectly normal, responsible life.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. You are free to leave. However, I strongly advise you to consider a follow-up test in three to six months to ensure complete accuracy. And I would also encourage you to discuss safe practices with your physician—regardless of your personal beliefs. Here is some literature for your review. Good day. .
PATIENT: Safe practices? Honestly, the audacity! Some doctors... just unbelievable. .
