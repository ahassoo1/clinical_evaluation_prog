DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer, you see? It’s in my leg, mostly. It’s been getting bigger, and it’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Right, the swelling. And this is related to treatment you received for cancer, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A few months ago now. They… did things to shrink it. And now my leg feels like a balloon. It's mostly on my right leg, the one they… worked on.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say “did things,” was that chemotherapy, radiation, surgery… do you recall specifically what the treatment involved?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was… a lot. I think… radiation, yes. And pills. Lots of pills. I don't remember the names, I'm sorry. They gave me so many! And… they poked me a lot. With needles. It all feels like a blur, really.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Many patients find the details difficult to recall after treatment. Let's focus on the swelling then. Has it come on gradually, or was it sudden?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It started small, just feeling a little puffier. I thought it was from… not moving enough. But it’s just kept getting bigger. It’s been maybe… a month or two since I really noticed it getting worse.
DOCTOR: A month or two. And is it constant swelling, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It's worse at the end of the day, definitely. In the morning, it's… okay-ish. But by evening? It feels like I’m walking with a log attached to my leg. I try to put my feet up, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the skin itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me see… It feels… warm sometimes. And the skin is… a little red. Not bright red, just… pinkish. And maybe a little thicker? I don’t know. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay. Warmth, redness, and some thickening. Have you experienced any pain, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no pain. And I can breathe just fine, thank you. No chest discomfort either. Just… heavy. And annoying! It makes wearing shoes difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Queener, it sounds like you may be experiencing lymphedema, which can sometimes occur after cancer treatment, particularly after radiation. It's caused by a buildup of fluid in the leg. But to be sure, I'd like to examine your leg and perhaps order some imaging. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lymp… what-edema? Oh dear. Is that… bad? Imaging? Like… pictures? I don’t mind pictures, I suppose. If it will help. I just want it to go away, you know? This heaviness is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Lymphedema is a common side effect, and while it can be bothersome, it's manageable. The imaging – an ultrasound, most likely – will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. It's a non-invasive test, just pictures of the tissues. Let's start with a quick exam of your leg, then we’ll talk about next steps. If you're comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An exam is fine. Just… be gentle, please? It's a bit tender. And… please explain what you’re doing as you go? I like to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go. Alright, if you could sit comfortably on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to gently feel your leg, check the skin, and measure the circumference at a few points to see if there’s a difference between your legs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Circum… what-erence? Measuring? Oh, goodness. Alright, let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just feeling along your leg now, checking for any tenderness or changes in the tissue. I'll start above your ankle and work my way up. Now, I’m just going to measure the circumference of your leg at this point, and then we'll do the same on your left leg for comparison. It doesn’t hurt, just a little pressure. Hmm. Okay. There is a noticeable difference in circumference between your right and left leg, as expected. The skin feels slightly warmer and thicker on your right leg as well. I don’t feel any obvious masses or lumps. Okay. Based on this initial examination, lymphedema seems likely. But to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot, I’d like to order a Doppler ultrasound. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A blood… clot? Oh dear! That sounds… scary. Ultrasound… yes, alright. If you think it's necessary. But is it… painful? And how long will it take? I have a little appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: A blood clot is something we always want to rule out with swelling, but it doesn't mean you have one. The ultrasound is a very safe and painless procedure. It uses sound waves to create images of the blood vessels in your leg. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule it for this afternoon, and I will make sure the results are sent to me as quickly as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Thirty to forty-five minutes… yes, that should be okay. As long as it doesn’t… hurt. And you'll get the results quickly? I don’t want to worry all evening.
DOCTOR: Yes, the ultrasound technician will do their best to get the results to me as soon as possible, usually within a few hours. I will have my nurse call you with the results as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’m going to write a referral for the ultrasound and also recommend a consultation with a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema management. They can teach you exercises and techniques to help reduce the swelling and improve your comfort. Would you like me to proceed with those orders?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Physical therapist… that sounds good. Anything to help. And thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel… less scared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. I’m just finishing up the orders now. Once they’re complete, my nurse will schedule the ultrasound and the physical therapy consultation for you before you leave. In the meantime, try to elevate your leg whenever possible and avoid prolonged standing. Do you have any questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s all. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. My nurse, Sarah, will be with you shortly. She’ll go over everything with you and answer any questions you might have. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good afternoon, Ms. Queener.
PATIENT: .
