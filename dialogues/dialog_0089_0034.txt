DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi! It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I just moved here. It’s, like, a social visit, I think? For healthcare? My husband said I needed to find a doctor when we got here. I don't really… remember all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A welcome visit is good! So, Medicare covered you moving here, excellent. And just to get a baseline, even though this is a bit of a check-up, are you currently experiencing any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… health concerns? Not that I know of. I feel… okay, I guess. Everything feels pretty normal? I mean, I get tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? Do you need me to… like, list things? I'm not sure what you want to know.
DOCTOR: No, no listing yet! Just trying to get a sense of things. Tiredness is common, you're right. Let's try this: have you noticed any changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… Oh! Actually, yeah. My vision's been a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but… especially when I'm working on stuff. I do… mechanical things. For work. It's kinda hard to explain. Does that count as a change?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts. Blurry vision is good to know. And when you say "mechanical things," is that mostly close-up work?
PATIENT: Yeah, super close-up. I work with… really small parts, mostly. And lots of tiny screws. My husband says I'm good with my hands. It’s kinda important for my job, so I guess it’s good it doesn’t bother me too much, but it's been happening more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this blurry vision been happening, and has it been getting progressively worse, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Umm… I think it started maybe… a couple months ago? It comes and goes, yeah. Some days I don't notice it at all, and other days it's kinda hard to see. Like, I have to hold things really close to my face. It hasn't gotten super bad, but… it’s definitely more frequent now than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides your vision, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm… not really, I don’t think so. I get headaches sometimes, but I always have. And I’m kinda clumsy, but that’s just me! My husband says I bump into things a lot. I don't know if that counts… It's probably just me being me.
DOCTOR: Okay. No, bumping into things isn't necessarily a medical concern. Headaches, you said you always have them – have they changed in any way recently?
PATIENT: Not really… they feel kinda the same. Just… normal headaches. They come and go, and sometimes they’re worse than others. I usually just take something for them, and they go away. I don't really pay much attention to them unless they're really bad. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not bad at all. Let's move on to some basics. Just to get a full picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Allergies… I don’t think so. I haven’t ever really had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always asks me that question, and I always say no. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Except maybe dust? I sneeze a lot when I’m cleaning. But that’s just normal, right?
DOCTOR: Dust allergies are very common, don’t worry about that. And what about any medications you currently take, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Umm… Just the stuff for headaches, sometimes. Like… ibuprofen? Or acetaminophen? Whatever the red box is. And… sometimes I take something for sleep, if I can’t fall asleep. It’s… a little blue pill. I don’t really remember the name. My husband gets it for me. I don't take them very often, though. Only when I really need to.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. I’d like to check your vision, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Vision, you said? We already talked about that, kinda. But yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just… don’t poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no poking, I promise! Let's start with your vision. Could you please sit here and look straight ahead?
PATIENT: Okay. Straight ahead, right? Like this? Is there something I'm supposed to be looking at?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Just focus on this chart, and tell me what you see on each line, starting with the top line. Don't worry if you can't read all of them, just do your best. We’ll start with your right eye. Cover your left eye with your hand, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Umm… E… F… P… T… Oh, this is hard! Is that right? I can kinda see them, but they’re blurry. Like… fuzzy. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's okay, that’s helpful to know. We'll keep going. Okay, now let’s try your left eye. Cover your right eye.
PATIENT: Okay. Um… This is even harder! I can barely see anything. Maybe… C? And… L? I don't know! They’re all blurry. It’s definitely worse with this eye. I knew it! Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. It does appear there's some difference in vision between your eyes, and some blurring. We'll need to check your blood pressure now. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… okay. Is that the one that squeezes my arm? My husband says I get nervous when they do that. Will it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise. The blood pressure cuff just squeezes your arm for a few seconds, it shouldn't hurt, just feel a little pressure. It’s a standard part of the check-up. I'll let you know when I'm starting, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. No needles, right? Just a squeeze. That’s… good. I guess. Okay, let me know when you start.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. Your blood pressure is 135/85. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just take slow, deep breaths.
PATIENT: Okay. Slow, deep breaths. Is everything okay? It feels kinda cold. I get nervous when people listen to my chest.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, good and strong. Your heart and lungs sound healthy. Okay, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it seems like we need to investigate the blurry vision further, and keep an eye on your blood pressure. Do you have any significant medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Significant medical history…? Ummm… Not that I remember, no. I haven’t really been sick much. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was… a long time ago too. My husband usually handles all the medical stuff. I just… show up when he tells me to. I don’t really remember anything else. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, no need to worry. It's good to know you haven't had any major medical issues. What about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Ummm… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. Maybe… I had my wisdom teeth taken out? A long time ago, when I was younger. But that doesn’t really count, right? It was just… a little thing. My husband would know for sure, but he’s not here.
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal counts. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family…? Ummm… my mom had… high blood pressure, I think? And my dad… he had something with his heart, but I don’t really remember what. He passed away a few years ago. It was… a long time ago. My husband always tells me to remind the doctors about these things, but I always forget. I'm not very good at remembering things. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s perfectly alright, don’t worry about it. It’s good to know about the family history of high blood pressure and heart issues. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! Uh, no, no, and no. Absolutely not. I don't smoke, I hardly ever drink alcohol, and I definitely don't use any… recreational drugs. My husband wouldn't approve. And I don't really like those things. I just drink tea, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Umm… I don't think so. Not that I remember. I haven’t ever really had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always asks me that question, and I always say no. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Except maybe dust? I sneeze a lot when I’m cleaning. But that’s just normal, right? I already said that, didn’t I?
DOCTOR: You did, and it's perfectly alright. It's good to confirm. Okay, so to summarize, you've recently noticed some blurry vision, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, you have a family history of high blood pressure and heart issues, and you had your wisdom teeth removed a long time ago. Based on this, I recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist to investigate the blurry vision further. We’ll also monitor your blood pressure over the next few visits. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An… ophthalmologist? What do they do? Is that something serious? And monitor my blood pressure… does that mean I have to come back a lot? I just moved here, and I'm still trying to get settled. Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: An ophthalmologist is an eye doctor, a specialist. They’ll do a more thorough examination of your eyes to determine the cause of the blurry vision. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, it could be something simple like needing glasses. We just want to rule out anything more significant. And monitoring your blood pressure just means checking it at each visit to make sure it stays within a healthy range. It won't require extra trips. We'll schedule your appointment with the ophthalmologist and then schedule your follow-up visit here. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… glasses… That doesn't sound too bad. And just checking my blood pressure at the visits… okay, that’s good. Yes, that sounds alright. Can you… can you schedule the appointment for me? I'm not very good at making appointments. And… um… is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I can take care of the appointment scheduling for you. Do you have any preferred days or times?
PATIENT: Hmm… Tuesdays are usually good, I think. Afternoons would be better. My husband usually gets home from work around 5, so I need to be home before then. I don’t really have a preference, honestly. Whatever works best.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see what's available… excellent. I've scheduled you an appointment with Dr. Chen, the ophthalmologist, for Tuesday, August 13th at 2:00 PM. They are located at 123 Main Street, Suite 400. I'll have my assistant print out the paperwork and directions for you. Do you have any questions about the appointment or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: August 13th… 2:00 PM… 123 Main Street… Okay. No, I don't think so. I think I got it. Thank you for scheduling everything for me. You've been very helpful. Is there anything you need from me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. No, I don't need anything further from you at this time. Just remember to bring your insurance card and a list of any medications you take, even over-the-counter ones, to your appointments. My assistant will be right in with the paperwork and directions. If you experience any worsening of your blurry vision or any other concerning symptoms before your appointments, please don't hesitate to call the office. It was lovely meeting you. Take care and have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Insurance card and… medications. I’ll have to ask my husband about that. Thank you again for everything. It was nice meeting you too. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a wonderful day, Emileigh.
