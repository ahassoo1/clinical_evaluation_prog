DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Just…chest pain. And my heart…it feels like it’s going too fast sometimes. Blood pressure is high, they say. Don’t know what that means exactly, but the nurse lady made a fuss. Let’s just get this over with, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. We'll get to the bottom of this. Chest pain and a fast heartbeat are certainly things we need to investigate. And yes, the nurse mentioned your blood pressure was a little elevated. First, let's talk about this chest pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It hurts. What more do you want to know? It’s…tight. Like someone is squeezing. Not all the time, though. Comes and goes. Usually when I…when I’m doing something. Or sometimes, just…sitting. It’s annoying, that’s what it is. Now, is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. "Tight" and "squeezing" are good descriptions. And it comes and goes, happening with activity or even at rest. Does anything specifically bring it on?
PATIENT: Specifically? No! How would I know specifically? Maybe stairs. Maybe…thinking too hard. I don't sit around taking notes on when my chest hurts, you know. I'm a busy man. I run things. Emergency Management Directors, that's what I am. Important work. Not time to worry about every little ache.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowic. You’re a very busy man, and I appreciate you taking the time to come in. It’s good that you are paying attention to this, even if it’s frustrating. So, to clarify, the pain happens with stairs and sometimes when you’re concentrating…anything else?
PATIENT: Concentrating…yes, sometimes when I’m thinking a lot. Or…when my wife yells at me. It’s stressful, okay? She worries too much. Always has. It makes my chest feel funny. And my heart…it beats faster then. Everything feels…tight. Now, are we done yet? I have a meeting this afternoon. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress definitely seems to be a factor. And it sounds like the chest pain and fast heartbeat happen together when you’re feeling stressed. That’s very important information. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you had any other symptoms along with the chest pain and fast heartbeat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t know! I’m not a doctor! I just feel bad when this happens. Maybe…a little short of breath. Sometimes. But I’m old! Old people get short of breath. It's normal. I don't need a lecture on old age. Just fix what's wrong with my chest.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Sobkowic. You don’t need a lecture. And shortness of breath is common as we get older, but it’s still important to mention. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you ever had these symptoms before?
PATIENT: Before? Hmm…yes. A few times. Not a lot. Years ago. Maybe…five years ago? Maybe more. I went to a doctor then too. He gave me some pills. I don’t remember what they were for. Didn't seem to help much, so I stopped taking them. Doctors always want to give you pills. Now, can we please get this over with? I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll try to avoid unnecessary medication if we can. It's good you remember having these episodes before. Do you recall what the doctor said was wrong back then?
PATIENT: Said? He mumbled something about…blood pressure. And something about…cholesterol. Fancy words. I didn't understand it. He just said I needed to eat better and exercise. Easier said than done when you’re running an Emergency Management department, you know? I don’t have time for salads. Now, are you going to poke me with a needle or what?
DOCTOR: No needles just yet, Mr. Sobkowic. I just want to gather a little more information. It sounds like your previous doctor mentioned high blood pressure and cholesterol. We'll definitely look into those. Let me ask about your family history. Does anyone in your family – parents, siblings – have heart problems?
PATIENT: Family history? My mother…she had something. When she got old. Something with her heart. She was very sick before she passed. My father…he died of…I don’t know. Old age, I think. He wasn’t a healthy man. Lots of smoking. Not like me. I quit years ago. Don’t bother me with family history. It doesn’t change anything. Now, what are you going to do about my chest? It's still tight just talking about it!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. I understand your frustration. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. It'll only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
