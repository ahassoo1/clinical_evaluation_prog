DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my breathing. It gets…difficult when I lie down flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought I should get it checked. I don’t like feeling like I’m…suffocating.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. “A little while” is rather vague, unfortunately. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… well, let me think. It started… perhaps three months ago? Maybe four. Around the time my niece visited from Albuquerque. Yes, definitely after she left. I remember because the weather was getting warmer then. It wasn't constant at first, just sometimes when I tried to read in bed. But now, it's almost every time. It’s quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. And when you say “difficult,” can you describe how it feels difficult?
PATIENT: It’s… a tightness in my chest, mostly. Like something is pressing on me. And I have to… concentrate to breathe. Not a fast breath, just… work at it. It's not painful, not exactly, but unsettling. And I often need to sit up to get a good breath. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. And does anything else happen when this occurs?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my ankles feel a little swollen at the end of the day. Not terribly, just… puffy. And I’ve been… more tired than usual, I suppose. But I am seventy-one years old, so one expects some tiredness. I haven't noticed anything else, not that I recall. Do you need me to think harder?
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s sufficient for now. Let's get a few basic measurements. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we'll check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Then, I'll need to examine your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s causing this breathing trouble, and get it sorted out, if possible. Let's get it over with, shall we? I have a book club meeting next Tuesday, and I’d hate to miss it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. I'm hearing some mild wheezing, primarily on the right side. Not terribly concerning at this point, but we’ll want to investigate further. Now, let's check your heart.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Oh dear. Is that bad? I don’t smoke, if that matters. My late husband, Harold, he smoked a pipe for years, but I always insisted he do it outside. Is it serious, Doctor? You’re making me nervous.
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Vanderwiele. It just means there’s some narrowing in your airways. Your history of non-smoking is helpful, certainly. Wheezing can be caused by many things – allergies, a minor infection, or something else entirely. It's not necessarily serious, but it requires investigation. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 88. Not alarming, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's take a look at those ankles. Yes, there's a bit of pitting edema here. And your oxygen saturation is 93% which is… acceptable, but could be better.
PATIENT: Pitting edema? Oxygen saturation? Doctor, you're using a lot of words I don’t understand. Is this something I should be worried about? I just want a simple answer, if you can give me one. Am I very sick?
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, it's not helpful to ask if you are "very sick." These findings suggest possible fluid retention, likely related to your heart’s ability to pump efficiently, and a slight reduction in oxygen levels. We need to determine the cause of these issues. It could be a simple matter, or it could require further attention. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. And I’ll also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out other possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh, goodness. I don’t like radiation. And an… EKG? Is that one of those things where they put stickers on your chest? I suppose if you think it's necessary. But I do hope it won’t take too long. I have that book club meeting, you know. Will I have to go to a special place for all this? I don't drive anymore, and my niece is quite busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, it involves stickers. And yes, you will need to go to radiology. It's in the building, just down the hall. The receptionist will schedule everything for you. It should be relatively quick. Frankly, Ms. Vanderwiele, worrying about a book club meeting at this point seems… less important than determining the cause of your breathing difficulty. We're being proactive here. We need information to make an informed decision about your care. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Well, that’s not very kind, Doctor. I’m perfectly capable of prioritizing my own concerns. But… no, no allergies, not that I’m aware of. I've taken plenty of medicines over the years, mostly for my arthritis. And I haven't had any reactions. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to know when I can expect to hear about these… results. I have commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: The radiology department will contact you to schedule the tests. Once they’ve been completed, the results will be sent to me, and I will review them. My nurse will contact you within 48 hours to discuss the findings and any necessary next steps. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… please make sure my nurse calls promptly. I don’t like waiting. And… thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I really do hope it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll do our best, Ms. Vanderwiele. Have a good day. .
