DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Sasha. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my leg. It’s been… puffy. After the treatments, you know? For the… the bad stuff. It's just… bigger than usual. And it’s a little uncomfortable. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sasha. “Puffy” after treatments… could you clarify what treatments you are referring to, and when you completed them?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It was… for the cancer. Breast cancer. I finished… let me think… about six months ago? Maybe a little more. They gave me… the medicine, through the vein. And then the… the rays. A long time of rays. It was at the big hospital, downtown. Does that make sense? I’m not very good with dates, sorry. But six months, give or take. It's the leg that was closest to where they did the… stuff.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Sasha. Knowing it was approximately six months ago following cancer treatment – specifically chemotherapy and radiation – is very helpful. And yes, it absolutely makes sense. The leg closest to the treatment site… is the puffiness in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the one. The left one. The right one is… normal, I think. It's mostly my ankle and calf that’s swollen. It's not… terribly painful, just… heavy. And sometimes it feels a little warm. I try to put my feet up, but… it doesn’t always help much. Is that… bad? Should it be going down by now?
DOCTOR: Okay, so the puffiness is isolated to the left ankle and calf, described as heavy and occasionally warm. And elevation doesn't provide significant relief. It's reasonable to inquire about whether this swelling came on suddenly, or gradually over time. Could you describe when you first noticed the swelling, and how it has changed since then?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it started… slowly. Maybe a month ago? At first, I didn’t even notice it, really. Just thought my sock felt a little tight. But then I noticed my shoe wasn’t quite as comfy. And then… it was definitely bigger. It hasn’t gotten much bigger lately, but it’s still there. It hasn’t gone down at all. I’m probably not explaining this very well. It's just... a puffy leg.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly well, Sasha. It's helpful to know it developed gradually over the past month and hasn’t significantly worsened recently, but also hasn't resolved. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any changes in your skin on the affected leg—redness, warmth, or any sores or breaks in the skin?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. The skin looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little dry, but that's just me, I always have dry skin. No redness, no sores, nothing like that. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, either. It just… feels different. And heavy. I worry it’s something bad, you know? With the cancer and everything… everything feels scary these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sasha, and it's completely valid, especially given your history. We’ll certainly investigate this thoroughly. Now, let’s move on to some other questions to get a complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me a long time ago. I take a little pill for it, every morning. That's it, I think. Nothing else. No diabetes, no heart problems. I was pretty healthy before the… before everything. Well, besides the blood pressure. But that’s been managed for years. Does that help? I always forget what the doctors ask! It's a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: It does help, Sasha. Knowing about the high blood pressure and that it’s managed is important. And please don't worry about forgetting things; it’s very common. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Every day. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take something for that. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. Not anything special. I don’t take it very often, only when I really need it. And I try to drink plenty of water, like the nurse told me. But that’s about it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin daily and ibuprofen occasionally for joint aches. Now, let’s briefly touch on your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or close relatives – who have had problems with blood clots, swelling in their legs, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. But she died a long time ago. And my brother… he had cancer, too. Lung cancer. But he lived far away, and we didn’t see each other much. I don't remember if he had problems with his legs or anything. No one else that I can think of. My grandparents… they all died when I was very young. Sorry, I’m not much help on that one. I don't really know much about their medical history.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sasha. Knowing about your mother’s heart condition and your brother’s lung cancer is helpful. Finally, let's quickly cover your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never smoked. Never even tried. It’s terrible for you, you know? My mother always told me that. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy and get a little bit of exercise, you know? Walking, mostly. Nothing too strenuous. I live alone, mostly. Keep myself busy. It's a quiet life. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sasha, that's very helpful. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. I'll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and carefully examine your left leg—checking for warmth, tenderness, and comparing it to your right leg. We’ll also check your pulses in both legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… good. I want to know what’s going on. I just want it to be… nothing serious. Please be gentle, though. My leg is a little sensitive. And… I get a little nervous with doctors sometimes. It's silly, I know. But please take your time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sasha. I will be as gentle as possible, and we'll take all the time you need. It’s not silly to be nervous, and I will explain everything as we go. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath in… and out… excellent. Heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Your right leg feels normal in temperature and has no swelling. Your left leg is slightly warmer to the touch, and I do note some swelling in your ankle and calf, as you described. Now I'm going to check your pulses. Your pulses are present, but slightly weaker in your left foot compared to your right. Based on this initial examination, the swelling in your left leg and slightly weaker pulse could indicate a few things. Given your history of cancer treatment, we need to rule out a blood clot, known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, and also consider lymphedema. To do that, we'll need to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot? That sounds… scary. Lymp-e-de-ma? What’s that? The ultrasound… will it hurt? I just… I don’t want anything serious. But if you think it’s necessary to check, then yes, please do whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it very expensive? I only have Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sasha. A blood clot is serious, but it’s important to remember we’re just gathering information at this point. The ultrasound is the best way to determine if one is present. Lymphedema is swelling caused by a build-up of fluid due to a problem in the lymphatic system, which helps drain fluid from the tissues. Cancer treatment, especially surgery or radiation, can sometimes damage the lymphatic system, leading to lymphedema. The ultrasound itself is non-invasive and painless. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and use a handheld device to create images of the veins. It doesn't involve any radiation or needles. Regarding the cost, the ultrasound is generally covered by Medicare, but there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. I can have them contact you after the examination if you'd like. For now, let's proceed with the ultrasound. I’ll write the order for it now, and the technician will call you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get it over with, I guess. And thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. It’s just… everything feels so uncertain these days. I appreciate you explaining everything so carefully. Could you… tell me if I should stay off my leg? Or is that okay? I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. I understand how unsettling uncertainty can be, and I'm glad I could provide some clarity. Regarding your leg, I don't recommend completely staying off it at this point. However, it's best to avoid any strenuous activity or prolonged standing or walking until we have the results of the ultrasound. Gentle movement, like walking around the house, is fine, but please listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain or increased swelling. We will know more after the ultrasound results are available. I will personally review them and contact you to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if the swelling worsens significantly, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I will have the order sent to the radiology department, and they will contact you to schedule the ultrasound. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Shely. You've been very kind. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I'll try to stay calm and wait for the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. I hope so too. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns before then. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
