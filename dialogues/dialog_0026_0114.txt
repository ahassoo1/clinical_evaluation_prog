DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, it’s my breathing. It gets harder when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought I should get it checked. I don't like feeling like I can’t get a good breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth, that sounds concerning. Difficulty breathing is always something we want to investigate. “Harder when lying flat,” you said… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. When I’m sitting up, or even standing, I’m alright. Not wonderful, mind you, but alright. But as soon as I try to lie down… it feels like something is pressing on my chest. Like there isn’t enough room. And then I have to sit back up. It’s… uncomfortable. I haven't been sleeping very well because of it.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s positional – worse when you lie down. And it’s affecting your sleep. Has this come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual worsening?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It didn’t just happen one day. It started… maybe a few months ago? Just a little bit harder to get comfortable. I thought it was just the mattress, to be honest. I adjusted the pillows, but it didn’t help. Then it just… got worse, slowly. It's not a sharp pain, you understand. Just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over a few months. Not a sharp pain, just difficulty. And you've tried adjusting your pillows already. That’s helpful to know. Now, besides the breathing difficulty when lying down, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, my ankles have been a little swollen lately. Not terribly, but noticeable. And I’ve been… more tired than usual. But I'm seventy-one, Doctor! A little tired is normal, isn’t it? I try to stay active, but sometimes… it's just harder to get going. Does swelling matter? I haven’t said anything to anyone about it before.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Maribeth. It’s good you mentioned it. Swelling in the ankles, along with the fatigue and breathing difficulty, can all be related. And no, feeling tired at seventy-one is normal, but we want to rule out anything else that might be contributing. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on medicine and it’s been controlled for years. I haven't had any problems with it lately. I also had my gallbladder out… oh, goodness, twenty years ago now. Other than that… not much. I try to stay healthy. I haven't been to the hospital for anything serious in a long time. I take a little water pill for the swelling sometimes, but it doesn’t seem to do a lot of good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so controlled hypertension and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. You also mentioned a water pill… do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a good question. My memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I get prescriptions from the pharmacy down the street and… they just put it in a bottle. I don't usually write down the names. It's a small white pill, I think. And I only take it when my ankles get really swollen. Not every day. I'm sorry I can't be more help. I should probably start writing these things down, shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Maribeth. Many people find it difficult to remember medication names. We can look it up in the pharmacy records if you like. No need to worry about it right now. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. A basic one. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. But not every day. Only when I need it. It's over-the-counter. I don’t take anything else. I try to avoid too many pills, if I can. Is that alright? I don’t want to be on a lot of medicine.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Maribeth. It’s good to be mindful of the medications you're taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat almost anything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I haven't been stung by a bee in years, and I haven't had any problems with penicillin or anything like that. No allergies, Doctor. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Maribeth. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother had high blood pressure, like I did. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. He was a smoker, you see. And my brother… he had diabetes. But other than that… not really. My family wasn't much for talking about illnesses, if I’m honest. They just… dealt with it. Is that helpful? I don’t have a lot of details.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Maribeth. Hypertension, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your brother. Knowing about these conditions helps us get a better picture. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I always hated the smell of it. My father smoked, as I said, and it always made me cough. I’ve always been very careful about my health. I don’t drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. I spend most of my time at home now. It's easier.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone. My husband… he passed away a few years ago. I have a son, but he lives in California. We talk on the phone, and he visits when he can, but it's not the same. I have a few friends, but… they're all getting older, like me. We don't get around much anymore. Mostly, I keep myself busy with my books. I work at the library a couple of days a week, you see. It keeps my mind sharp. Does that make sense? I don’t want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Maribeth. It's good you have ways to keep yourself engaged. Now, before we proceed, let’s quickly review. You’ve mentioned breathing difficulties when lying flat, ankle swelling, fatigue, controlled hypertension, a gallbladder removal, and a family history of hypertension, heart trouble, and diabetes. You don’t smoke, drink very little, and live alone. Is there anything else you think I should know at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. I just… I want to feel better. It's getting harder to do the things I enjoy. And I worry about falling, if I can’t get my breath. Now… what happens next? I hope it’s not too complicated. I don’t do well with a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: I understand, Maribeth. We'll take things one step at a time. Based on what you’ve told me, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs for swelling. Then I think a chest x-ray would be helpful to see what's going on in your lungs. We might also want to do a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes for the swelling. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An x-ray… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. And a blood test… I don’t like needles, but if it’s necessary… alright. Just… tell me what to expect, please? I don’t want any surprises. And is it going to hurt? I worry about pain. And… can I still go to the library tomorrow? I promised Mrs. Henderson I’d help her find a book.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. I'll explain everything. The chest x-ray is very quick—it only takes a few minutes. You'll stand in front of a machine, and a technician will take a picture of your chest. It doesn’t hurt at all—you'll just need to hold your breath for a few seconds. As for the blood test, it’s a small prick in your arm, and it might sting for a moment. It doesn't usually cause any lasting pain. And yes, you can absolutely still go to the library tomorrow—there's no reason you shouldn't. It shouldn’t interfere with your day at all. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit back and lean forward a little?
PATIENT: Alright. Leaning forward… Yes, I can do that. I hope everything is alright. My mother always said a strong heart was the most important thing. Please be gentle. I get nervous easily. Now… what are you listening for, exactly? I don't want to be alarmed. I just... want to know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. I'm listening for any unusual sounds – things like wheezing, crackles, or murmurs. Wheezing can indicate some narrowing in your airways. Crackles can suggest fluid in your lungs. And murmurs can sometimes be a sign of a heart valve problem, but they're very common and don't always mean anything is wrong. I’m also listening to your breath sounds to make sure you’re getting enough air into your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please… And again… Your breathing sounds are a little diminished, especially at the bases of your lungs. I also hear some slight crackles on both sides. It's not alarming, but it suggests there may be some fluid buildup. It's consistent with what you've described. Now let’s check your legs for swelling. Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Alright. Extending my legs… Yes, that’s alright. They do feel a little puffy today. I haven't been elevating them enough, I suppose. I just get tired and forget. Is that bad? Is it a sign of something serious? I hope it’s not my kidneys. My uncle had kidney problems, and he wasn't very well. Please tell me the truth, Doctor. I can handle it. Now, what are you looking for when you touch my legs?
DOCTOR: I'm checking for pitting edema – that's when fluid builds up under the skin, and leaves a temporary indentation when I press on it. Yes, I do see some pitting edema on both ankles – it’s mild, but it’s there. And it’s consistent with the swelling you’ve described. It could be related to your kidneys, but it’s more likely related to heart failure or poor circulation, given your breathing difficulties. That's why I want to do the chest x-ray and blood tests to get a better picture. It’s important to rule everything out. So, to summarize: diminished breath sounds with crackles, mild pitting edema in both ankles, and a history of positional breathing difficulties. The x-ray will help us see if there’s any fluid around your lungs or heart. The blood tests will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out other potential causes. Does that make sense, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes sense. A little frightening, but… makes sense. So, it could be my heart? I always worried about my heart. My father had a bad heart, you see. And now… this. Alright. The x-ray and the blood tests. I suppose it’s the best thing to do. Where do I go for the x-ray? Is it in this building? And… how long will it take? I have to get back to the library tomorrow. Mrs. Henderson is relying on me. I don't want to disappoint her. And... will it hurt? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Maribeth. It could be your heart, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. We need to gather more information first. The x-ray machine is just down the hall, in the radiology department. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes, including the paperwork and waiting time. As for the blood test, the lab is right next to the radiology department. They’re very good there—they'll make you as comfortable as possible. The prick is quick, and it's over before you know it. It's just a small pinch, and they have numbing cream if you're really worried. I'll write you a requisition for both tests, and the technicians will guide you through everything. They’re used to nervous patients. And don’t worry about Mrs. Henderson – you’ll be back at the library tomorrow. Here you are. Take these to the radiology and lab departments. Once the tests are done, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Alright. The requisition… thank you. Radiology and then the lab. And then… schedule an appointment. Yes, I think I can manage that. No… I don't think I have any more questions right now. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I’ll go get these tests done, and then… I'll see you later. And thank you again. I hope everything is alright. It’s just… I worry. It’s a habit.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And try not to worry too much – we’ll figure it out together. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
