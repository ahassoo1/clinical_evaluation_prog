DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Trestrail. I see you're 83 years old. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin' to ya, Doctor. Schneer is right, yes. Eighty-three... feels like yesterday, honestly. Well, to be honest, I think it’s my ears. Things just… aren't as clear as they used to be. People mumble, you know? Or maybe I’m mumblin’? I can’t rightly say. It’s just… hard to hear sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficulty hearing. I see. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. A long while now, I reckon. A few years, maybe? It sort of crept up on me, didn’t happen all at once. I mostly notice it when there's a lot of noise, like at the diner. Or when my nephew visits – he talks fast, that boy! But it's gettin' worse, I think. Harder and harder to make out what folks are sayin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's been a gradual onset over a few years, worse in noisy environments, and impacting your ability to understand speech. Do you notice it more with certain people, or is it generally consistent?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, it’s definitely worse with my nephew, like I said. He speaks so quick! And my grandniece, bless her heart, she kinda mumbles. But… folks that speak clear, nice and slow, I can usually hear them alright. Though sometimes… even then I have to ask 'em to say it again. It's funny, isn't it? Don't remember it bein' this bad when I was workin’ at the shoe factory though… all that noise, you’d think I’d be used to it!
DOCTOR: Interesting. So, it’s more pronounced with faster speech or less distinct articulation. Have you had any ringing in your ears, or any pain or dizziness associated with this difficulty?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. You know, sometimes I think I do. Like a faint whistle, kinda. But I just figured it was… old age! Never really bothered me much. Pain? No, not at all. Dizziness… well, I get a little unsteady sometimes, but I figured that was my knees. I've always had bad knees. Old work injury, you see. Shoe factory wasn’t easy on a body. But no, not dizziness with the ears, not that I recall. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Alright, so a faint whistling sound occasionally, no pain, and no dizziness directly related to the ear issue. The knee issues are separate, good to know. Now, let's move on to other things. Have you had any ear infections recently, or any history of ear surgery?
PATIENT: Ear infections… goodness, let me think. When I was a young lad, maybe? A few. But nothin’ serious. And surgery… no, never had nothin’ done to my ears. I’ve had a bit of work done on my knees, like I said, but never the ears. I do remember… my mother always used to say I had big ears, always gettin’ cold in the winter. But that’s about it! She wasn’t a doctor, though, just a mother. Does that make sense? I tend to ramble…
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Schneer. No ear infections recently or any history of ear surgery. And no, you’re not rambling. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… well, the doctor has me on somethin’ for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill, take it every mornin’. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my arthritis, when it’s really botherin’ me. But that’s just when it flares up, you see? And…oh! I take a little somethin’ for my knees, too, sometimes. Can’t rightly remember the names of ‘em, though. My daughter helps me with all that. She fills the little pill boxes, bless her heart. I just take what she gives me, you know? Is that bad? I don’t mean to be a bother…
DOCTOR: It's not bad that your daughter helps you manage your medications. That's very practical. It would be helpful if we could get a list of exactly what you are taking. I'll have the nurse check your electronic medical record to get a complete list. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of her, to check that for me. I appreciate that, I really do. Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not to food, not that I recall. And I don't think I'm allergic to any medicines. But… when I was a boy, I got a terrible rash from poison ivy. Does that count? And I always get itchy when I wear wool. But that's just itchy, you know? Not a proper allergy, I don’t think. My skin is just… sensitive. Is that helpin'? I'm tryin’ to be as clear as I can. It’s just… hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug or food allergies, a history of a poison ivy rash, and sensitive skin. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your ears. I’ll use an otoscope. This won’t hurt, I just need to see inside. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. I'm going to start with your right ear.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds sensible, Doctor. Don't want no hurtin', that's for sure! Right ear, you say? Go ahead, take your time. Just… be gentle, alright? My ears are… well, they're old ears! And I might flinch a little, just a warnin’. Old habits, you know. Worked around loud machinery for years, jump at every little noise. But I'll try to hold still. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some cerumen – that's earwax – in the ear canal, but nothing overly significant. The eardrum itself appears intact, although it is a little dull in color. Now, let’s check the left ear. Similar findings here. Some cerumen, and the eardrum is also a little dull. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've seen, it sounds like you likely have some degree of presbycusis, which is age-related hearing loss, and possibly some wax buildup contributing to the issue. The dullness of the eardrums suggests some fluid in the middle ear, potentially contributing to the problem as well.
PATIENT: Oh my. Presby-what-sis? And fluid in my middle ear? Sounds…serious! Is that bad, Doctor? I’m too old for serious things, you know? I just want to be able to hear my grandniece when she comes to visit. And maybe hear the baseball game on the radio. Is there somethin’ you can do about it? And what about the wax? Is that somethin’ I should be worried about? I'm gettin' a little flustered now, to be honest. I don’t understand half of what you’re sayin’…middle ear…fluid… it all sounds so complicated!
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Schneer. Let’s take it one step at a time. Presbycusis is very common as we get older – it just means your hearing has naturally declined with age. It's not a disease, it's a normal part of getting older. The fluid in the middle ear is something we’ll need to investigate a little further, but it’s not necessarily serious. The wax buildup is common too, and can definitely contribute to hearing difficulties. We can easily address that. I'm going to order a formal audiology test to get a better understanding of the type and degree of your hearing loss. This will involve going to a specialist who will play sounds at different frequencies and volumes to see what you can and can’t hear. We can then decide on the best course of action. I also want to order a tympanometry to see if there is fluid behind your eardrum. For the wax, I can perform a cerumen removal in the office today if you’d like. It’s a simple procedure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, a specialist, huh? More folks to see… Alright. I suppose it can’t hurt. Specialist sounds sensible. I just want to understand what’s goin’ on. And the…tympan-what-something? More words I don’t understand! And the wax… well, if it’s simple, I reckon I’d be comfortable with that. Get rid of the wax, maybe I’ll hear a little better. But please be gentle, Doctor. I don’t want nothin’ poked or prodded! And tell me if it’s gonna hurt. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, you see. Old age makes ya jumpy. But yes, let’s get rid of the wax. And maybe I’ll see this specialist, too. But just… be patient with me, alright? My brain ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I understand. We’ll take everything one step at a time. The tympanometry is just a quick test that measures the movement of your eardrum—it doesn’t involve anything being poked or prodded, it’s completely painless. I’ll have the nurse schedule the audiology test for you. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for it. Now, let’s take care of this wax. It’s a very simple procedure. I’ll use a small, gentle tool to remove the wax. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way, and we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That's good to know, about the…tympan-thing. Not poked or prodded, you say? That’s a relief! And no wax, either? Good, good. No wax sounds sensible, too. And the nurse… she’ll explain everything? Bless her heart. She probably has a better memory than me! No… I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And tell me what you’re doin’. I like to know what’s goin’ on, you see. And if it hurts, just… stop, alright? I’m an old man, I don’t want no pain. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate that. Go ahead, get rid of the wax. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Just relax, and I’ll take care of you. I’m going to gently insert this small instrument into your ear canal. You might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m carefully removing the wax buildup. "Just a little pressure now… there we go… see a bit of wax coming out… okay, that's good… a little more… alright, just about there… and… done. " "Okay, it looks much clearer now. The ear canal is nice and open. How does that ear feel?
PATIENT: Oh… that was a little strange, I must admit! But not painful, no, not at all. Just…odd. Like somethin’ ticklin’, maybe? I felt a little pressure, like you said, but nothin’ bad. And clearer, you say? Hmmm… Let me see… It feels…lighter, maybe? Hard to explain. It doesn’t feel as…stuffed up, I suppose. Like there’s a little more room in there. Can you hear better? That’s what I want to know. Let me see… Hello? Can you hear me alright now? Just say somethin’. Anything. Just test it.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Schneer, can you hear me clearly now?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, now, that is better! Yes, much better, I reckon! Not perfect, mind you, still a little muffled. But definitely clearer! I could hardly hear you before, and now…well, I can actually hear you! That's wonderful, Doctor. You've done a good job. Really good. I appreciate that. Now… what about the other ear? Can you do that one, too? Get rid of the wax in that one? Maybe I’ll be able to hear my grandniece and the baseball game!
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. Glad to hear there’s already an improvement. We’ll tackle the other ear now. It's the same procedure – gentle, quick, and shouldn't be painful. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time.” “Alright, here we go… just a little pressure now…” “There we go… getting some wax out now… okay, that's good… a little more… and… done. “ “Alright, that ear looks much clearer as well. How does that one feel now?
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn’t bad at all! A little ticklin’, like before, but nothin’ unpleasant. And yes… both ears feel…lighter! Like somethin’ has been lifted off ‘em. It's hard to explain, but it feels…better. Let’s test it! Let’s see if I can hear you! Hello? Can you hear me alright now? Say somethin’, Doctor! Anything at all! I'm ready! Test it, test it!
DOCTOR: "Mr. Schneer, can you hear me clearly now?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness! Yes! Yes, I can hear you! Much, much better! Not perfect, mind you, still a little muffled around the edges. But I can hear you! Clear as a bell! That’s wonderful, Doctor! Really, truly wonderful! Thank you! Thank you so much! You’ve done a brilliant job! I can actually hear things again! I think I can hear the birds chirpin’ outside! Now… about that specialist… and that…tympan-thing. What happens next? And will I be able to hear the baseball game? That’s very important, you see. Very important indeed.
DOCTOR: “I’m so glad to hear that there’s a significant improvement, Mr. Schneer! That’s excellent news. The wax removal has clearly made a difference.” “Now, regarding the specialist – an audiologist – they will perform a comprehensive hearing test to determine the type and degree of your hearing loss. This will help us understand exactly what sounds you’re having trouble with and if you might benefit from hearing aids. The tympanometry is a quick, painless test that measures the movement of your eardrum. It helps us rule out any fluid buildup in the middle ear. " “As for the baseball game… that’s a very valid concern! Once we have the results from the audiologist, we can discuss options to help you hear better, potentially including hearing aids. Whether you'll be able to hear the game clearly will depend on the results and what solutions are best for you. I will give you a referral to a highly-rated audiologist in the area. The nurse will provide you with all the necessary information and schedule the appointment. " “Do you have any other questions for me right now, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, an audiologist… Alright. That sounds sensible. A thorough test, you say? I suppose that's a good idea. Gotta know exactly what's wrong, gotta have all the facts. And hearing aids…well, I always thought those were for old folks. But if it means I can hear the baseball game, I suppose I’m willing to try ‘em. Will they be noticeable? I don’t want everyone knowin’ I’m wearin’ hearin’ aids, you see. And will they be comfortable? I got sensitive skin, like I said. And… how long does all this take? I don’t want to be waitin’ forever to hear the home team play.
DOCTOR: “Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Schneer. And I understand them completely.” “Hearing aid technology has come a long way in recent years. They’re much smaller, more discreet, and more comfortable than they used to be. Many are nearly invisible, fitting comfortably inside your ear canal. The audiologist will discuss the different styles and options available and help you choose the best fit for your ears and lifestyle. They’ll also ensure a comfortable fit.” “As for the timeframe, the appointment with the audiologist is usually scheduled within a week or two. The testing itself takes about an hour. If hearing aids are recommended, the fitting process usually takes another hour or so. It may take a few weeks to adjust to them, but the audiologist will provide you with all the necessary support and guidance. We'll work with you to make sure they fit comfortably and you're hearing as well as possible." “Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s reassuring. Nearly invisible, you say? Good, good. I don't want everyone starin' at my ears. And a week or two…that's not bad, not bad at all. Will my insurance cover ‘em? Medicare, you know. I got Medicare. That’s important. Very important. I don’t want to be payin’ a fortune for hearin’ aids. And… what happens if they don’t work? What if I can’t get used to ‘em? Can I just…give ‘em back?
DOCTOR: “Those are excellent questions, Mr. Schneer, and very important ones. Let's address them one at a time. Regarding your insurance, most Medicare plans do cover a portion of the cost of hearing aids, but the coverage can vary depending on your specific plan. The audiologist's office will work directly with your insurance provider to determine your coverage and any out-of-pocket costs. They can also help you explore any potential financial assistance programs. As for what happens if they don't work or you can't get used to them, most hearing aid providers offer a trial period, typically 30-60 days. During this period, you can return the hearing aids for a full refund or exchange them for a different style. They want to ensure you’re completely satisfied with your hearing aids. If they're not a good fit, you won’t be stuck with them." “Do you have any other concerns I can address for you today, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know! A trial period, you say? That's very reassuring. And workin' with my insurance…excellent. That takes a load off my mind. I think… I think that’s all the questions I have for now. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Very patient, and you explained everything so clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man ramble on about his ears and baseball games. Thank you. I’ll have the nurse schedule that appointment with the audiologist, then. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns down the line. I’m glad I could help. “It sounds like we’ve got a good plan in place. I wish you all the best, and I hope you’ll be enjoying the baseball games in no time.” "Have a wonderful day, Mr. Schneer."
PATIENT: .
