DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing a… well, a lot of pressure in my bladder lately. It’s been quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bladder pressure can be quite uncomfortable. Can you tell me a little more about this pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a constant feeling, really. Not necessarily painful, but definitely noticeable. It feels like I need to go to the bathroom all the time, even if I’ve just gone. It’s been going on for about two weeks now, I think. Perhaps a little longer? It's difficult to pinpoint the exact date, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant feeling of needing to urinate frequently for the past couple of weeks. And you said it's not painful, just a persistent pressure. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve observed. The color seems normal, and I haven’t noticed any… unusual odor, or anything like that. Just the usual, really. I haven’t seen any blood, thankfully. Is that something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Good, no changes in color or odor, and no blood – that’s helpful to know. Yes, it’s always good to be aware of those things. Okay, let’s try to narrow things down a bit. Are you experiencing any pain or burning during urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. It doesn’t hurt when I go, just the constant feeling beforehand, and the frequency is the main issue. It's… distracting, to say the least. It hasn’t interfered with my sleep, but it’s certainly a nuisance throughout the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain during urination, just the frequency and the persistent sensation. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any fever or chills. My back has been a little sore lately, but I attributed that to spending too much time at my desk designing. I do a lot of work on the computer, and my posture isn’t always the best, if I'm honest. It’s a dull ache, not sharp, and it comes and goes. It doesn’t feel related to the bladder issue, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no fever, chills, or sharp back pain, just a dull ache you're attributing to your work. Do you have any difficulty starting the stream of urine when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. The stream starts normally, and it’s… a normal strength, I suppose. It doesn’t feel weak or hesitant, and I don’t have to strain to get it going. It just… happens frequently. It's really more of an annoyance than anything. Would it be helpful if I kept a log of how often I’m going?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no difficulty starting the stream. Yes, a log would be very helpful. Just note the time you urinate, and roughly how much you're voiding each time. We can review that next visit. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Other than that, no major illnesses or surgeries. I do have seasonal allergies, but those haven’t been bothering me lately. And, as I mentioned before, my Medicare is current. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Well-controlled hypertension is good to know. And seasonal allergies, noted. Are you currently taking any medications for your hypertension, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 10mg daily, for the hypertension. That’s the only medication I’m currently on. I also take a daily multivitamin, but that's over the counter and not prescribed. I make sure to drink plenty of water as well, as I understand hydration is important, especially with blood pressure. Is there anything else you need to know about my medications, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily and a multivitamin. Good that you’re staying hydrated. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat all types of food without issue. My husband is the one with the allergies, not me. He’s allergic to peanuts and shellfish, but that’s irrelevant to my condition, I assume?
DOCTOR: Right, your husband’s allergies aren’t relevant. And no known allergies for you, that’s good. Now, let’s quickly touch on your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like kidney disease, bladder problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My mother had type 2 diabetes, and she unfortunately passed away from complications related to it a few years ago. My father has arthritis, but that's the extent of any major medical issues in my immediate family, if I recall correctly. My maternal grandmother did have frequent UTIs, though, now that I think about it. Does that information seem pertinent, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of type 2 diabetes with your mother and frequent UTIs with your maternal grandmother. That's potentially relevant, yes. And finally, a quick question about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly quiet life, mostly focused on my work and spending time with my husband. I'm not a big partier, if that gives you an idea. Does that answer your question sufficiently?
DOCTOR: Okay, non-smoker, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. That’s good to know. Alright, Ms. Creagh. Based on what you've told me – the frequent urination, no pain, controlled hypertension, maternal history of diabetes and grandmother’s UTIs – it sounds like we need to rule out a few things. I'd like to start with a urinalysis to check for infection and glucose in your urine. We can also do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any obvious issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A urinalysis and a physical exam seem like a sensible starting point. I’m happy to proceed with whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Should I empty my bladder before the urinalysis?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Empty your bladder as completely as possible before giving the sample. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the procedure, and we’ll get started with that, then I’ll do a brief exam. It's a standard procedure. The nurse will get you set up.
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I'll wait for the nurse then. Thank you.
