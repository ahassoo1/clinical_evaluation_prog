DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it's...down there. Something's...leaking. It's not right, you know? Not right at all. I don't usually talk about these things, but it's been a few days now. It's kinda gross, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some urinary leakage, and it's been going on for a few days. It's perfectly alright to talk about these things – we’re here to help! It's good you came in to get it checked out. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Urinary? Is that like…peeing? I don’t know about that word. It’s not always like that, but sometimes…yes. A little. Mostly just…discharge. Like something's coming out. I don't know why it's happening. I haven't…done anything different. I just woke up one day and there it was. It’s embarrassing, really. A woman my age… shouldn’t be dealing with this.
DOCTOR: Yes, urinary leakage means leaking urine, or peeing a little when you don't mean to. You're right to describe it as discharge too – it sounds like there's more going on than just a little urine. It's totally understandable that it's embarrassing, and honestly, it's quite common, even at any age. There are lots of reasons why this can happen. Okay, so it sounds like it started a few days ago without any specific change in activity. That’s good to know. To help me figure things out, can you tell me if it happens with certain activities, like coughing, sneezing, or exercising?
PATIENT: Coughing... hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe. I do a lot of gardening, you know? Bending over, digging... I cough sometimes when I'm out there, dusty and all. And bending over… yes, maybe a little then. Not a lot. Exercising? Oh, goodness no. I don't exercise. Just walking around the house, maybe. This is just… awful. I feel like I need to wear a diaper, and that’s no way for a woman to live!
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse with coughing, bending, and gardening, which involves both bending and coughing. That gives us a good starting point. It’s good you’re being so observant. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what the discharge looks and smells like?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You want me to… look at it? I don’t know… I haven’t really… looked. I just know it’s there. It’s kinda… yellowish, I guess? And it doesn't smell good. Not like flowers, that’s for sure. Sort of… sour? I don't know how to explain it. I just wipe it away. It's disgusting. Honestly, I'm a very clean woman, you know? This isn't like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge with a sour smell. That's helpful information. And I understand it’s unpleasant, and you’re a very clean person, so this is definitely concerning. To get a better understanding of your overall health, have you had any fever, pain in your lower abdomen, or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I know of. I haven't felt hot or anything. My tummy doesn’t hurt, no. Just… annoyed, you know? Annoyed that this is happening. And no pain when I… go. It doesn’t hurt to pee, thank goodness. It just… leaks sometimes. It's very frustrating. I just want it to stop. Is this something serious, doctor? You're making me worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no abdominal pain, and no pain with urination. That’s good. It sounds very frustrating, and I completely understand why you’re worried. To help me narrow down what might be causing this, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. That's a long time ago. I don’t go to the doctor much. I had… the usual childhood things, you know? Measles, chickenpox. Nothing serious. As an adult… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had pneumonia once? A very long time ago. I don't remember much. I don't take any pills, if that matters. Just a little vitamin C sometimes. And I haven’t been with anyone for a very long time. Does that matter? This is all very personal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, gallbladder removal, and pneumonia in the past. You don't currently take any medications other than occasional Vitamin C, and you haven't had a sexual partner for a long time. That’s all very helpful information. Now, let's talk about family history. Do you have any family members – mother, sisters, daughters – who have had similar problems, like urinary leakage or infections?
PATIENT: Oh, family... my mother… she didn’t talk about these things, dear. Not ever. My sister, she passed away a long time ago. We weren't very close. And I never had any children, so… no daughters. I don’t know if anyone else in the family had… problems like this. We didn’t talk about these things. It was just… not done. I'm sorry, I can't really help you there. Is this going to take much longer? I have my gardening to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's perfectly alright. It sounds like family history isn’t something we can explore further at this time. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your abdomen and a brief pelvic exam to take a look at the area and see if we can identify any obvious causes. It’s important to understand what we’re dealing with, and the exam will help me decide if we need any further testing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam? At my age? Honestly, doctor, I don’t know… I haven’t had one of those in… well, a very long time. And I’m not really comfortable with that. It just seems… unnecessary. Can’t you just give me something for it? Some kind of cream or pill? I really don’t want anyone… down there. It’s embarrassing enough as it is. This is just… I don’t know if I can.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. A pelvic exam would help me rule out some potential causes and ensure we’re on the right track, but I absolutely respect your wishes. We can explore other options. Given your discomfort with a pelvic exam, we can start with a urine test to check for an infection. That's a non-invasive way to gather information. If the urine test is clear, and your symptoms don't improve, we can discuss referral to a gynecologist for further evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A urine test sounds… alright. Not poking around, that’s good. Yes, a urine test. That I can do. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I really do need to get back to my garden. The tomatoes are ripening, you know? And if the tomatoes get overripe, they just… mush. It's a whole thing. So, yes, a urine test. Let's get that done.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. A urine test it is. I'll have the nurse come in to collect a sample. It’s a simple procedure - just a cup, and you’ll do it in the restroom. I’ll let you know the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, pain in your lower abdomen, or if the leakage gets significantly worse, please give us a call right away. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… hurry up with the test, okay? The tomatoes… they’re very important. And please, don’t mention this to anyone. It's very private. Really, very private. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you not… poking around. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. Your privacy is very important to me, and I won't discuss this with anyone. I'll let you know the results as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse come in to collect the sample now. Thank you for coming in today, Jimmi. And don't worry about the tomatoes – we'll get this sorted out so you can get back to gardening.
