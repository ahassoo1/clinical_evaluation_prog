DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 83 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…my eyes feel dry. Been that way a bit. Don’t need a lot of time, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: "A bit," you say. Well, we shall see. While I appreciate your desire to be concise, Mr. Pipolo, I do require a thorough understanding of your condition to provide appropriate care. “A bit” could mean anything from mild irritation to a serious underlying issue. Let's start with the dryness itself. When did you first notice this dryness, and has it been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Constant, I guess. Hard to say when exactly. Maybe…a few months now? It's just…scratchy, you know? Like there's sand in 'em. Not bad all the time, but…enough to bother me. I work outside a lot. Concrete work. Maybe that has somethin' to do with it.
DOCTOR: Concrete work, yes. That certainly could be a contributing factor. The dust and debris…quite irritating. "A few months," you say. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both. Not worse on one, just…both feel it. Mostly when it's windy, I think. And when I'm workin', naturally. I try to wear glasses, but they don't always help.
DOCTOR: Glasses…are they prescription glasses, Mr. Pipolo, or simply safety glasses?
PATIENT: Just safety. I don't need regular ones. Old man thing, I guess. Eyes ain't what they used to be, but I can still see well enough for what I do. Mostly just…protect 'em from the dust.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the dryness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm…not really. Maybe a little…burnin' sometimes? Not all the time. And I gotta blink more, I think. Just tryin’ to keep ‘em wet. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Burning, increased blinking…Alright. Now, let’s move beyond the eyes for a moment, Mr. Pipolo. Do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never really had trouble with pollen or nothin'. I eat just about anything, don't bother me none. Not that's botherin' me, anyway. You askin' if I'm allergic to cement dust? 'Cause I'd be surprised. Been workin' with that stuff for fifty years.
DOCTOR: A fair point, Mr. Pipolo. Fifty years is a considerable amount of time. But even with prolonged exposure, sensitivities can develop. Very well. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. Never been one for pills. And don't need 'em. I eat good, get enough sleep, and get out in the sun. That's my medicine. What kinda medicine you thinkin' I need anyway? Just for dry eyes? Seems silly.
DOCTOR: "Seems silly," you say. While I understand your skepticism, Mr. Pipolo, ignoring a chronic irritant can lead to more significant complications. I simply wish to rule out any underlying causes before dismissing this as a minor inconvenience. Now, have you had any past medical problems, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Broken a few bones workin', mostly when I was younger. Fell off a scaffold once, busted a wrist. Had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. No surgeries, never been in the hospital overnight. Tough as nails, I guess. Don't get sick easy.
DOCTOR: "Tough as nails," you say. That is…commendable. And what about your family, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Family? Not much left. Lost my wife a long time ago. No kids. Got a cousin somewhere, but haven't seen her in years. Not real close, if you know what I mean. Not much help askin' her about medical stuff. Never been a medical family, if that makes sense. Healthy bunch, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, regarding your lifestyle, Mr. Pipolo…do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? Just a beer now and then, with dinner. Nothing fancy. Don't really need it, but sometimes it tastes good. Not every day, though. Maybe once a week, twice if it’s hot. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I’d like to take a quick look at your eyes, Mr. Pipolo, if you don’t mind. Just a brief examination. I will need you to look straight ahead, and I'll shine a light into each eye. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with then. Don’t take all day. I got concrete to pour.
DOCTOR: Alright, look straight ahead for me, Mr. Pipolo…Good. Now the left eye… Hmm. I see some mild injection – redness – in both eyes, consistent with irritation. Your corneas appear clear, no obvious abrasions or foreign bodies. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. I also note a bit of dryness on your eyelids, but nothing remarkable. It appears you are experiencing what I would classify as moderate dry eye, likely exacerbated by your outdoor work and exposure to dust and wind.
PATIENT: Moderate, huh? So what’s that mean? Do I need somethin' fancy? Like…eye drops or somethin'? I ain't got time for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: “Fuss,” as you call it, Mr. Pipolo, is often necessary to maintain your health. Moderate dry eye means your eyes aren't producing enough lubrication to stay comfortable. Yes, eye drops – specifically, artificial tears – are the first line of treatment. I recommend using preservative-free drops, four times a day, even when your eyes don’t feel particularly dry. The preservative in some drops can actually worsen the irritation with frequent use. I am prescribing a bottle of Systane Ultra Preservative-Free. In addition, I suggest wearing wraparound sunglasses when working outdoors to shield your eyes from wind and dust. And if possible, try to avoid rubbing your eyes, as that can exacerbate the irritation. Here is the prescription. You can pick this up at your local pharmacy. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Sunglasses I can do. And eye drops…four times a day. That sounds like a lot. But alright. I guess I can try it. How long do I gotta do this for? Forever?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily forever, Mr. Pipolo. We will reassess in one month to see how you are responding to the treatment. If your symptoms improve significantly, we can gradually reduce the frequency of the drops. If they persist, we may need to consider other options, such as a more specialized lubricating ointment or referral to an ophthalmologist. However, given your lifestyle and consistent exposure to irritants, you may need to continue using artificial tears periodically to maintain comfort. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Periodic…Alright, alright. I get it. Drops when I need 'em. One month checkup. Don't make me come back if it ain't helpin', though. I got work to do. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pipolo, that is all. If your symptoms worsen before your one-month follow-up, or if you experience any new symptoms such as pain, blurry vision, or discharge, please contact the office immediately. I trust you will adhere to the instructions. Have a…productive day.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Drops, sunglasses. I'll remember.
