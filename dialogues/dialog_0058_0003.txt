DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, you know. It's this hand. Shakes like a leaf. Been happening for...well, a while now. Honestly, it's just annoying. My wife used to say... never mind. Just fix it, alright?
DOCTOR: Right. “Fix it.” Okay. Well, we’ll try to figure out what “it” is first. A while now… can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you want from me? Months, maybe? Years? I don’t keep track of these things. It just… started. Probably when I stopped directing, honestly. All that pressure… ruined my nerves, I tell ya. Though, that was a long time ago. Don't need a history lesson on my life, doc. Just the hand.
DOCTOR: Months to years… alright. And it’s just in this hand?
PATIENT: Just this one. The other one's perfectly fine. Always has been. Used to be good for holding a camera, that one. This one... not so much anymore. It makes it hard to even eat, sometimes. Dropping things. It’s embarrassing, you know? A man shouldn't be dropping his spaghetti.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it constant shaking, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Worse when I’m… trying to do something. Like, if I try to write – forget about it. A mess. When I'm just sitting, it's not as bad. Though, it still happens. Just… less noticeable, I guess. Honestly, it's always there, lurking. A nuisance, plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I’m just an old man with a shaky hand! Don't go getting fancy with me, doc. No, I don't feel sick, if that's what you're asking. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's just… old age. I don’t need a list of things to be worried about, alright? I just want this hand to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. Let's move on then. Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you're really digging. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. In her knees. A lot of complaining, if I remember correctly. My father... he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life. Probably died of stubbornness. Don't see how that helps with my hand, though. Honestly, this is a waste of time. Is there a pill you can just give me?
DOCTOR: We’re not going to just give you a pill, Mr. Baide. We need to understand what’s causing the shaking before we start treatment. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to see how things look. Can you hold your arm out in front of you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect miracles. It’s going to shake, obviously. This isn't exactly a secret, you know. Get it over with, doc. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm checking your reflexes now. And just relax your hand. I see a resting tremor, and it seems to increase with movement. Muscle tone appears normal. It's definitely a tremor. Now, let me check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Gait and balance? What am I, a tightrope walker? I'm an old man, not an acrobat! Fine, but be ready to catch me. See? Perfectly fine. Just a little unsteady, that’s all. Old age, remember? Don't make a big deal out of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your gait is slightly wide-based and there's a mild instability. Now, I want to rule out any other underlying causes. Do you have any memory problems, difficulty swallowing, or changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Memory problems? Of course I have memory problems! I’m eighty years old! What do you think, I remember everything perfectly? As for swallowing... no, I can still eat my spaghetti, even if I drop some. And speech? I’m talking to you perfectly fine, aren’t I? Look, this is getting ridiculous. You’re asking me a bunch of questions that have nothing to do with my hand. Just tell me what’s wrong with it!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it's most likely essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes rhythmic shaking, often in the hands, and it tends to worsen with age. However, to be certain and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a blood test to check your thyroid function and a few other things. And I think a referral to a neurologist would be a good idea. They can do more specialized testing and discuss medication options with you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests and neurologists…more waiting, more appointments. Honestly, what’s the point? I’m old. It’s probably just old age. Fine, do your tests if you have to. But I’m not promising I’ll go to any neurologist. Just…get it over with quickly. And if there’s a pill, just tell me. That’s all I ask. A simple pill. Is that too much to ask? .
