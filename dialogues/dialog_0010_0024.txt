DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Just confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s for a trip I’m planning, and the airline needs it. It sounds silly, I know, but they’re being very strict this year.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. Not silly at all, airlines are becoming quite particular. Let me just pull up your record here… Kiante Sayar, age 33. I see you’re insured with Medicare. Have you been seen by any other doctors recently, or is this a new request with me?
PATIENT: No, you’re the first doctor I've seen about this. I usually don’t need anything like this, but… well, things are different now. I had a… loss recently, and they just want to be sure everything’s okay before I travel. It’s more of a precaution, I think. I can give you more details if you need them, but it's mostly just paperwork, right?
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m very sorry to hear about your loss, Kiante. Travel can be… complicated after something like that. And no, it’s not just paperwork. A fit-to-fly assessment requires me to ensure your health won’t be negatively impacted by air travel. It’s a bit more than just a quick sign-off, for your safety. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. I understand the safety part. I wouldn’t want to cause any trouble. Generally, I’m quite healthy, I think. I eat reasonably well, try to get some exercise when I can, though that’s been… harder lately, obviously. No major medical conditions, no allergies I’m aware of, and I don’t take any regular medications. I had all my vaccinations as a child, and got the usual boosters. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Just trying to get a complete picture. Have you had any recent illnesses – even something like a cold or the flu – in the past few months?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a really bad cold in February, but that was it. I was stuck in bed for a few days, but I recovered completely. I haven’t been sick since, thankfully. It feels like a long time ago now. Everything else has been… quiet, health-wise.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells recently?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. I haven't had any chest pain at all. My breathing's been normal, and I haven't felt dizzy or faint. I did feel a bit run-down for a while after… everything, but that was more exhaustion, I think. Nothing physical like that. I’m really trying to be thorough, so please, if there’s anything I should be thinking about, let me know.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you. Given your recent loss, have you been experiencing any significant anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: That’s… a fair question. Yes, I have. It comes and goes, you know? Some days are better than others. I’ve been trying to manage it, mostly by keeping busy, but it’s… difficult. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything, and I haven’t sought any treatment yet. I’m not sure if that’s relevant to the flight, though? I just… I don’t want to make things harder than they need to be.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Kiante. Emotional and mental health absolutely can be impacted by travel, and air travel can sometimes exacerbate existing conditions. We need to consider this carefully. Are you currently experiencing any panic attacks, or have you had any thoughts of self-harm?
PATIENT: No, no panic attacks. And absolutely not any thoughts of self-harm. I’m… I’m stronger than that. It’s more just… a constant feeling of sadness, and being easily overwhelmed. I get tired very easily, and I’m not sleeping well. I’m not actively struggling, if that makes sense. I can function, I can work, I just… I’m not myself, really. I’m just worried about whether that will be a problem on the flight. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're managing, but understandably still processing a lot. It's good you're aware of how you're feeling. To be thorough, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart and lungs, and make sure everything physically looks okay. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I was expecting something like that, to be honest. I want to make sure everything is okay, too. The more information, the better, right? Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could please sit back and relax. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. Take some deep breaths for me. Okay, heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72 and steady. Everything sounds good so far. Now, could you take a few deep breaths while I listen again?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That feels… normal, I think. I haven't been doing much walking lately, so I’m a little out of practice with breathing exercises. I hope I’m doing it right. Is everything okay? You don’t have to tell me if it’s bad news, but I’d rather know.
DOCTOR: No, everything sounds perfectly fine, Kiante. Your lungs are clear, and your heart rhythm is regular. That’s very reassuring. Given your history and the exam, I don't believe there are any physical reasons preventing you from flying. However, given your recent loss and the anxiety you’re experiencing, I would recommend a few things before your trip. Would you be open to discussing those?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Absolutely. I want to do everything I can to make sure I’m prepared. I’m already feeling a little anxious about the travel itself, so anything that can help would be greatly appreciated. I'm ready to listen. What do you recommend?
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’d recommend scheduling a brief session with a therapist or counselor before your trip, even just one or two sessions. They can equip you with some coping strategies for managing anxiety during travel. Second, ensure you have any medications you might need – even something like an over-the-counter sleep aid or anti-anxiety medication if you feel it’s necessary. We can discuss prescription options if you’re interested. Finally, I recommend planning for extra time at the airport and being kind to yourself. Travel can be stressful even under normal circumstances. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable. I was thinking something like that might be helpful, to be honest. A therapist is a good idea. I've been putting it off, but maybe this is the push I needed. Medication… I’m a little hesitant about that, but I’m open to discussing it. Perhaps we can see how I feel after a session with a therapist first? And yes, extra time and being kind to myself… that sounds crucial. I tend to be very hard on myself. So, about the therapist… do you have any recommendations? And could you write me a letter confirming my ability to fly, with a note mentioning I’m seeking support for anxiety related to travel? That might reassure the airline.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can definitely write you a letter like that. As for therapist recommendations, I have a few colleagues who specialize in grief and anxiety. Dr. Anya Sharma is excellent, and she has offices nearby. I can provide you with her contact information. There's also a telehealth option, called "BetterHelp," which might be more convenient. I'm happy to include a note about your plan to seek support for anxiety related to travel in the fit-to-fly letter. And I will also note that you have a clear physical exam. Here you go. This should satisfy the airline’s requirements. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: This is perfect, thank you so much, Dr. Annesley. You've been very thorough and helpful. I feel a lot better knowing I have this, and a plan in place. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and offer suggestions. I think that’s everything, yes. Unless… is there a cost for this visit? And will Medicare cover it? I'm not entirely sure what they cover these days. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Let me see… this visit is billed as a preventative exam with a mental health component. Medicare should cover a portion of the cost, but there may be a copay or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed breakdown of charges and your out-of-pocket expenses. Here's the number for our billing department. They’re very helpful. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns before your trip. I hope you have a safe and peaceful journey.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Dr. Annesley. I will definitely contact the billing department. And I really appreciate your kind words.
