DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this… feeling full awful quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what it is, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a big meal. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It's just... bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food, for about a month now. That is bothersome. Let's try to get a little more detail about that. Can you tell me, is it painful when you feel full?
PATIENT: No, not painful exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like, pressure, I guess. And it's not right after the first bite, usually. It’s after a few, like I said. A few spoonfuls of soup, a few bites of a sandwich... then bam, full. Not sick full, just… done. It’s hard to explain. I just don’t enjoy my food anymore, ‘cause I can’t eat much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, not pain, after a few bites. And it's impacting your enjoyment of food. That gives me a bit more to work with. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I mean, I've lost a little weight, maybe five pounds, but I figured that was just getting old. And sometimes… well, sometimes I feel a bit tired, but who doesn’t these days? Nothing major, though. No sickness, no trouble going to the bathroom, nothing like that. Just the full feeling quick and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some weight loss and fatigue along with the early satiety. Let's talk about your past medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve been pretty healthy all my life, knock on wood. Had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s just old age again. Never been to the hospital for anything serious, never had any major illnesses. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I wanted, until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, just some arthritis. And no previous hospitalizations or major illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a surgery. Always managed to avoid those, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a Haida woman, you know, very connected to the land and natural remedies. I always tried to live a healthy life, like she taught me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries either. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had some trouble with her stomach when she got older. Not sure what it was exactly, something about it not emptying right, maybe? My father was a fisherman, strong as an ox, never seemed to get sick. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. It’s been a while since we talked, though. We don’t see each other much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stomach issues in your mother, high blood pressure in your brother. That’s helpful. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't had a drink in… oh, goodness, must be fifty years. Used to have a little beer with my father sometimes when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. I prefer a cup of tea, myself. Mostly just water, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, no alcohol. Very good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. Some ibuprofen when my hands are really bothering me. And sometimes I take a little fish oil for my joints. That’s it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. My mother always said natural remedies were best.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and fish oil. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to see if anything feels unusual. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I haven't been feeling myself lately, so I'm glad you're being thorough. Just let me know if anything feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’m feeling a slight tenderness in your upper abdomen, but no significant masses or guarding. Your abdomen is soft overall. No rebound tenderness or organomegaly appreciated. Okay, that was helpful.
PATIENT: Hmm… that tenderness. I do sometimes feel a little… fullness right up there, under my ribs. Not painful, like you said, just uncomfortable. Like something’s… heavy. But it goes away after a while. It's just… weird. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, that tenderness and fullness in your upper abdomen is good information. Given your symptoms – early satiety, weight loss, fatigue, tenderness in the upper abdomen – and your age, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like gastritis or a mild gallbladder issue. However, we need to rule out anything more serious, such as a peptic ulcer or even something like early-stage stomach cancer. I want to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, liver function, and electrolytes. I also think a stool test to check for blood would be a good idea. Finally, I recommend we get an upper endoscopy – that's where a small camera is inserted down your esophagus to visualize your stomach and duodenum. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… sounds like a lot. Stomach cancer? That’s… frightening. I guess if you think it's necessary… But all that poking and prodding… Is there really no other way? What would the endoscopy show, exactly? And how long would all this take? I'm not sure I want to know if something's wrong, if you understand. Just… trying to figure out what all this means.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension completely, Mr. Obarr. It is a lot, and hearing the word “cancer” is understandably frightening. Let me assure you, we are not jumping to conclusions. We are simply being thorough, given your symptoms and age. Many things can cause these symptoms, and most of them are not cancer. The endoscopy will allow us to directly visualize the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine – to look for any inflammation, ulcers, or abnormal growths. We can also take small biopsies – tiny tissue samples – for closer examination under a microscope. As for timing, the blood work and stool test can be done today. The endoscopy would need to be scheduled with a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – and that typically takes about a week or two, depending on their availability. The procedure itself takes about 15-20 minutes, and you'll be sedated, so you won't feel any discomfort. I know this is a lot to process. I want to emphasize that my priority is to get a clear understanding of what's going on and provide you with the best possible care. If you're hesitant about the endoscopy, we can discuss alternative imaging options, like a CT scan, but it's not as accurate as a direct visualization. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A CT scan… That sounds a little less scary than a camera going down my throat. I guess if it’s not as accurate… maybe the endoscopy is best. I just… I don’t want to know if I’m sick. But I also don't want to just ignore it and have it get worse. Okay, let’s do the blood work and the stool test today. And then… schedule the endoscopy. A week or two is fine. Just… please explain everything to me afterward, okay? Don’t use any fancy medical words, just tell me what’s going on in plain English. And… what about the cost? I’m on a fixed income, and I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable approach, Mr. Obarr. We'll start with the blood work and stool test, and then schedule the endoscopy. I absolutely promise to explain everything to you in plain English afterward – no medical jargon, I assure you. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern about being on a fixed income and not having insurance. Let me have my staff look into financial assistance programs and see if we can find any resources to help cover the costs of the tests and the endoscopy. Many hospitals and clinics have programs available for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. We'll also see if there are any charity care options. I’ll also talk to the gastroenterologist’s office to see if they have a financial counselor who can assist you with the billing process. I don’t want the cost to be a barrier to getting the care you need. In the meantime, I’ll order the tests now and have my staff come in to draw your blood and give you instructions for the stool sample. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And thank you for looking into the cost. That really means a lot. I guess… I’ll just try not to worry too much until we have the results. Easier said than done, though.
