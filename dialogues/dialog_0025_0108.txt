DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Gentz, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, no offense, but this whole… rural setup isn’t exactly inspiring confidence. But, alright. I’ve been… bleeding. From, you know, down there. It started a few days ago, just a little, thought it was nothing. Now it’s… more than a little. And it's worrying me. Not thrilled about it, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. Okay. And you’re a male, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, obviously. What kinda question is that? Look, I’m not here to play twenty questions. I'm Brad Gentz. And yes, I'm a man. Bleeding isn’t exactly… normal for us, is it? I work with… well, let's just say I deal with bodies all day, and even I know that. It’s got me spooked, alright? And it ain't a pleasant topic.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. No need to get agitated. It is unusual. Just trying to get a complete picture. When you say “a few days ago,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm… let me think. It was… Tuesday, I reckon. Yes, Tuesday. August 1st. I was… cleaning out the retort, routine stuff, and noticed it afterwards. Didn’t think much of it 'til Wednesday it got a bit worse. Now, today, well, it’s… concerning. More than just a spot, if you catch my drift. I usually don’t bother with doctors, truthfully. Waste of time, usually. But this… this feels different. And I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday, August 1st. And it’s progressively worsened since then. Can you describe the bleeding for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well, it’s… red. Obviously. Like blood usually is. Not bright red, more… dark. And it’s not just a drip, Doc. It’s… more than that. When I… you know… go to the bathroom, there’s a noticeable amount. And sometimes, there’s little… bits in it. I don’t want to be too graphic, but it's not exactly… clean. It's clotted, mostly. And it smells… metallic. Look, I’m a practical man. I deal with this stuff all day. This isn’t right. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or anything. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark red blood, clots, metallic smell, and a noticeable amount. Have you experienced any pain associated with this bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, Doc. More like… discomfort. A sort of cramping, low down. It's not crippling, mind you. I've had worse stubbing my toe. But it's there. Especially when I… well, you know. It feels like something’s… strained, if that makes any sense. And I've been a bit… tired lately, more than usual. Chalked it up to the heat, mostly. But now… I’m starting to wonder. It’s just… unsettling. I don’t like feeling weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping and fatigue. And you said you haven’t made any changes to your diet or routine recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Same meals, same work, same… everything. I have a sandwich for lunch every day, ham and cheese on rye. And I drink my coffee black, always. I haven’t taken any new medications, haven't been traveling. I'm a simple man, Doc, as I said. Routine is important to me. This whole bleeding thing is throwing everything off. And truthfully, I’m a bit embarrassed, you know? Having to explain this to a… well, to anyone. It's not exactly a normal conversation. And it’s worrying me sick. Especially given… my line of work. I’ve seen enough to know when something’s not right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand your concern, and it's good you're observant. Now, I’m going to need to ask you a few more questions. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Not really. It’s been hot, you know? Hard to tell the difference between a chill and just being too warm. Night sweats… maybe a little. I sleep with a fan on, always have. It gets stuffy in the summer. But nothing dramatic. I wouldn’t say I've been soaked through or anything. Just… a bit clammy sometimes when I wake up. Honestly, I usually just toss the covers off and go back to sleep. It's nothing I've paid much attention to, truthfully. This bleeding is the main thing bothering me. It’s… unnatural. And it's got me thinking about… well, you don’t need the details. Let’s just say it’s not a good look, given my profession.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Gentz, I’m going to need to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. I understand this may be uncomfortable, but it's important. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I’m not thrilled about it, obviously. But if it’s gonna figure out what’s wrong, then… fine. Just try to be quick about it, alright? And… professional. I’m not looking for a lecture or anything. Just tell me what you find. And, if you could, try not to make eye contact the whole time. It’s a bit… awkward, you understand? Let's just get it over with. The sooner we know, the better. I’ve got work to do, you know. Bodies don’t cremate themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. If you’ll just disrobe from the waist down and lie down on the table. I'll be as quick and professional as possible. I'm going to start with an abdominal exam and then, if you'll permit, a rectal exam. It's necessary to assess the source of the bleeding. Please let me know if you experience any pain during the exam.
