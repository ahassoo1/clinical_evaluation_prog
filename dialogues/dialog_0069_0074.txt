DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. My blood pressure's been acting up, that’s what the lady on the phone said I needed to come in for. It’s been high, she said. I don't really understand all that doctor talk, but I figured I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that’s perfectly alright. We can definitely take a look at your blood pressure and figure out what’s going on. It’s good you came in to get it checked. So, when you say it’s been “acting up,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I been feelin' kinda tired lately, more than usual for an old woman like me. And sometimes I get a headache, right in the back of my neck. It comes and goes. Mostly, I just feel… off. My daughter, Sarah, she’s the one who noticed I was slowin' down and told me to call. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of Sarah to look out for you. It's good to have family who care. Feeling tired and having headaches can certainly be concerning. Do you know roughly when you started noticing these symptoms—the tiredness and the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Seems like… maybe a month or so ago? It started slow, just feelin’ a little more worn out than usual after bakin’. Now it’s almost all the time. Hard to say exactly, time kinda blurs when you get to be my age, you know? I mostly just keep busy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, time does have a way of doing that. About a month ago…okay. And is the headache constant, or does it come and go as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Not every day, thankfully. Mostly when I've been on my feet all day, bakin' for folks. It's a dull ache, not a sharp pain. I used to just take some of those… whatchamacallit… aspirin, and it would go away. But it hasn't been helpin' much lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes, especially after being on your feet. And the aspirin isn't helping as much anymore. That's good information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and headaches?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I figured that was just my eyes gettin' old. And… oh! Sometimes I feel kinda dizzy when I stand up too fast. Not real bad, just a little wobble. I gotta hold onto somethin' for a second. Mostly, that’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and dizziness when standing up… okay. Those are important things to mention. Now, Venna, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had a bit of arthritis in my hands years ago. That’s why I can’t do as much fancy work with the dough anymore. And I had my gallbladder taken out when I was… oh, musta been forty years ago now. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, knock on wood. I’ve always been a strong Cherokee woman.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Arthritis and gallbladder removal. And it's wonderful you’ve remained strong. Have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just the gallbladder. I always tried to avoid doctors when I could. My grandmother had a lot of herbs and remedies she taught me, and I got by with those for a long time. Sarah says I can’t do that anymore though, says I need to see a real doctor now. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you have Sarah looking out for you, and it sounds like your grandmother had a wealth of knowledge. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, besides the aspirin you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the aspirin, when I take it. And sometimes I take a little something for my joints, it’s a cream, I rub it on my hands. It doesn't really do much, but it feels nice, keeps them warm. It's called… uh… let me see… Oh, darn. I left it at home. It’s just a regular arthritis cream, you can get it at any drugstore.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the aspirin and the arthritis cream. And we can look that cream up later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. I never had any problems with bee stings or poison ivy or nothin’ like that. I’m pretty lucky that way too. Always been a strong constitution, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, Venna, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mama, she lived to be 95. She had some trouble with her heart when she got older, but she was strong right up until the end. My daddy… he didn’t live as long, he worked hard in the coal mines and his lungs weren’t good. Sarah’s daddy, my husband, he had high blood pressure too, towards the end. That’s why Sarah’s so worried about me, I reckon. She lost him too young.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to know about your mother's longevity and your husband’s blood pressure. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, been widowed for ten years. I keep busy bakin' for the folks in town. I get orders for birthdays, weddings, you name it. I walk around a bit, but mostly I'm standin' at the counter bakin'. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables, but I do like my sweets, of course! I used to garden, but it’s gettin’ harder to get down on my knees these days. Don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. Never smoked a day in my life. My grandmother would’ve killed me if I did!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active lifestyle, despite the challenges. Now, one final question before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any concerns or questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Well, I just want to know… is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? Sarah's makin’ a big fuss, and I don’t want to worry her too much. I just want to be able to keep bakin', that’s all. It’s what keeps me goin'. And I’d like to know if I need to stop bakin’ for a while. That’d be awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venna. It’s completely reasonable to be worried, and you’re right to ask. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but the symptoms you’re describing—the tiredness, headaches, dizziness, and blurry vision—could be related to a number of things, including high blood pressure, as Sarah suspects. That’s why I’d like to do a quick physical exam, check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few other basic checks. Then, depending on what I find, we may need to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. We’ll figure this out together, and I’ll do my best to get you back to bakin' as soon as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. As long as you think I can still bake someday. I’m ready when you are. Just don’t make me lie down on one of those skinny tables if you can help it, my old bones don’t bend like they used to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. No skinny tables, I promise. We’ll do everything sitting down. First, let’s just take your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright. Here you go, Doctor. Be gentle now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 160 over 95. That is higher than we’d like. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. And your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s just check your pulse in your feet. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. And finally, let's just check your reflexes quickly. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but good to note. Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Everything you’ve told me and the preliminary exam suggests we should run some tests. Would you be willing to get some blood work done and perhaps an EKG, just to get a more complete picture of what’s going on?
PATIENT: Tests… sounds alright, I reckon. If it’ll help me get back to bakin’. When can I get them done? And will they take long? I got orders to fill, you know. Mrs. Henderson’s anniversary is next week!
DOCTOR: I understand about Mrs. Henderson’s anniversary! We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. The blood work will take about 15-20 minutes, and the EKG is very quick – just a few minutes lying down with some patches on your chest. Our lab is right across the hall, and they can usually get the results back within a day or two. I’ll have the nurse draw a requisition for the blood work and schedule you for an EKG after we’re done talking. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of medication to help bring your blood pressure down. It’s just a starting dose, and we’ll adjust it based on your test results and how you’re feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Medication… well, I don’t like takin’ pills, but if you think it's best. Just don't give me nothin’ that’ll make me sleepy, I gotta stay alert for bakin'! What kinda side effects will it have? And will it interact with nothin’ else? I take that arthritis cream, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication, Venna. We'll start with a very low dose, and we'll monitor you closely for any side effects. The medication I’m thinking of is Lisinopril. It’s generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild dizziness, fatigue, or a dry cough. We’ll be sure to discuss these potential side effects in detail. Regarding the arthritis cream, it shouldn’t interact with Lisinopril. But to be absolutely sure, I’ll double-check the ingredients and your medical history with the pharmacist. I will write the prescription for the Lisinopril now. The nurse will explain the dosage and instructions clearly before you leave. Also, let's schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the test results and see how you're feeling. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A week… alright. That gives me time to get Mrs. Henderson’s cake done, at least. And you'll double-check about the cream? Good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I have a batch of cookies in the oven that need my attention. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave, Doctor? Or can I go tend to my bakin’ now?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful about Mrs. Henderson’s cake! And yes, I will absolutely double-check about the arthritis cream. The nurse will go over everything with you – the prescription, the lab requisitions, the EKG appointment, and some information about managing high blood pressure. She’ll also give you a written summary of our discussion today. No, you don’t need to do anything else right now. You can absolutely go tend to your baking. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate! Thank you for coming in today, Venna. I’m glad we had a chance to talk. If you experience any concerning symptoms – like severe dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath – please call the office immediately. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you in a week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old woman like me. I reckon I better get back to those cookies before they burn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. And do be careful with those cookies! .
