DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Gentz is fine, don’t need the “Mr.” Look, it’s… well, it's embarrassing to even talk about. But I’ve been… losing blood. Down there. Not a little bit, either. It's been going on for a few days now, and honestly, it’s starting to worry me. I don't usually bother with doctors, but this… this ain't normal.
DOCTOR: I understand, Gentz. It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, but you’re doing the right thing by coming in. It's always best to get these things checked out. You said it's been going on for a few days. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: A few days, yeah. Started, I wanna say, last Thursday. It wasn’t much at first, just… a little streak when I, uh, you know. But it’s gotten worse each time. Now it's… substantial. Enough to worry a man. And it's not just after going to the bathroom, either. Sometimes it just… happens. No warning. It's dark colored, if that matters. Not bright red. Like… old coffee grounds, maybe? I don't know. I don't spend much time looking at it, to be honest. It's unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Dark colored, like old coffee grounds… and happening sometimes without a bowel movement. I understand it’s unpleasant to look at, but that detail is important. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I've been feeling a bit tired, I suppose. But I'm always tired. Work is… demanding. Crematory work isn't exactly a walk in the park. So I figured it was just that. But… now that you mention it, I have been a little more lightheaded than usual. And… weaker, maybe? Like I don’t have the strength I used to. I'm not eating much, either. Don't really have an appetite. Everything just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, lightheadedness, weakness, and decreased appetite. Those are all things we need to consider. You mentioned you work in a crematory… that's physically demanding work, and potentially exposes you to certain things. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort, either abdominal pain, back pain, or any pain when you urinate or have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little cramping sometimes, like… regular stomach cramps. Nothing major. Easily ignored. And no, nothing when I go to the bathroom. Urinating is fine. Bowel movements… well, they’ve been a little… loose, I guess. Not diarrhea, but not solid, either. And… look, I don’t want to sound like a hypochondriac, but I've lost weight, too. My clothes are fitting a bit looser than they used to. My wife… well, she always said I was too skinny to begin with, but even she's noticed. It’s been about ten pounds, maybe? Over the last month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loose stools, cramping, and unintentional weight loss of about ten pounds over the last month. That’s definitely concerning, and it’s good you mentioned it. Given your symptoms – the rectal bleeding, the changes in bowel habits, the fatigue, weakness, weight loss – I’m concerned about a few possibilities, and we need to investigate further. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been a fan. Always figured I could handle things on my own. And my wife… well, she tried to get me to take something for my back, but I refused. Just tough it out, that was my motto. Supplements? Nope. Don’t believe in that stuff. Just a waste of money, if you ask me. I drink coffee, black, every morning. And… well, a little whiskey sometimes, to unwind after work. That's it. Nothing else. I really don't like putting things into my body that need to come back out.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Just coffee and occasional whiskey. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll also need to perform a rectal exam. This is important to help determine the cause of the bleeding and assess your overall health. I'll explain everything as I go, and please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Seriously? Look, I appreciate you wanting to figure things out, but… that’s a bit much, isn't it? I mean, couldn't you just… run some tests? Blood work, or something? I’m not comfortable with that. Not at all. I’ve never… had someone stick their hands… down there. That seems awfully invasive. And frankly, unnecessary. I told you what's going on. Can’t you just prescribe something for it? An anti-diarrheal, maybe? Or something to stop the bleeding? I really don’t see the point of poking around.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I absolutely respect your discomfort. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a rectal exam. However, it’s a crucial part of evaluating the cause of rectal bleeding, especially given your other symptoms. It allows me to physically assess the rectum and identify potential sources of bleeding, such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or, more importantly, to detect any masses or abnormalities that wouldn't be visible with blood work alone. Blood work is important, and I will order those tests, but it won’t give us the complete picture. Skipping the exam could delay a diagnosis and potentially lead to more serious complications down the line. I want to assure you I will be as gentle and professional as possible, and I will explain every step of the process. We can also have a nurse present if that would make you more comfortable. However, to properly assess your condition and provide the best possible care, I strongly recommend allowing me to perform the exam. If you are still extremely uncomfortable, we can discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist who can perform a colonoscopy, which is a more detailed examination of the entire colon. But that requires a specialist appointment and may take some time to schedule. Would you like me to explain the colonoscopy process in more detail?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… that sounds even worse. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came in here for a little blood, not a whole… invasion. Look, I’m a practical man. I run a crematory. I deal with… unpleasant things all day. But this… this is different. It's a violation, plain and simple. And frankly, I don’t trust you to be “gentle.” No offense, but you don't seem to understand how… unsettling this is. I’ll tell you what. Just give me something for the bleeding. Something to stop it. And maybe something for my stomach. I'll keep an eye on it. If it gets worse, then I’ll think about… other options. But I’m not sticking anything up my… well, you know. It's just not happening. I’m not comfortable, and I have a right to refuse treatment.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, and I absolutely respect your right to refuse treatment. I want to be clear: I am not trying to force you to do anything you are not comfortable with. However, I am ethically obligated to inform you of the potential risks of declining a thorough evaluation. Given your symptoms – rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habits, fatigue, weakness, and weight loss – there is a possibility of a serious underlying condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Simply treating the symptoms without identifying the cause could delay appropriate care and potentially lead to complications. I am concerned about the possibility of conditions like colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or significant ulcers. While these are not definite diagnoses, they need to be ruled out. I will document your refusal of the physical exam and your request for symptomatic treatment. I can prescribe you an anti-diarrheal medication to help with your loose stools and a mild anti-inflammatory to potentially reduce any abdominal discomfort. However, please understand that these medications will only address the symptoms and will not resolve the underlying cause of your bleeding. I strongly urge you to reconsider, and I am happy to discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist who can perform a colonoscopy. They may be better equipped to address your concerns and provide a more comfortable experience. If you experience any worsening symptoms – increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, fever, or significant dizziness – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions before I write the prescriptions and provide you with discharge instructions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the prescriptions. And look, if things don't get better in a few days, I’ll… I’ll think about it. But right now, I just want to go home. I have work to do. People are depending on me. I don't have time for… all this. And frankly, I’m still not comfortable with you poking around. I appreciate you trying to help, but this… isn't working. Just write the prescriptions and let me go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gentz. I understand. I will write the prescriptions for an anti-diarrheal medication and a mild anti-inflammatory. I will also provide you with written discharge instructions outlining the potential signs and symptoms to watch for and when to seek immediate medical attention. Please remember that I strongly recommend a follow-up evaluation with a gastroenterologist, and I can provide you with a list of specialists in the area if you’d like. Here you are. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen. Thank you for coming in today. .
