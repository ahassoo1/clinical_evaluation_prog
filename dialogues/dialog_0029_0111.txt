DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion? And feeling tired, I suppose. It’s all rather bothersome. Let's get this over with quickly, shall we? I have important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand you’d like to keep this brief. We can certainly do that. Your wife mentioned a change in your complexion and some fatigue. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose my skin looks…darker. Not ill, you understand, just…not as bright as it once was. And yes, I tire easily. Lifting rebar isn't the youthful pastime it once was. I've been doing it for sixty years, you know. Sixty years! One gets worn down. Is that all? Do we need to enumerate every ache and pain of an elderly man?
DOCTOR: Okay, darker complexion and fatigue, especially with physical exertion. Sixty years of heavy lifting is significant. Has this change in complexion been gradual, or did it happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I presume. I haven’t kept a meticulous calendar of my skin tone, Doctor. It just…happened. Like the greying of my hair, or the slowing of my gait. Things change. Must we dissect the minutiae of aging? Is there a test to simply…confirm I am, in fact, getting old?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. We're not trying to simply confirm age, but rather to rule out any underlying medical causes for these changes. Fatigue and changes in skin tone can sometimes be related to other conditions. Besides the complexion and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, I have the typical complaints of a man my age. A little stiffness in the joints, perhaps. Occasional indigestion. Nothing…remarkable. My wife would have a list a mile long, I’m sure. But I assure you, it's all perfectly normal for a man who's spent a lifetime wrestling with iron. Are we getting anywhere, or should I simply schedule my next appointment now?
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness and indigestion. No recent fevers, chills, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Good heavens, no! I enjoy a hearty appetite. My wife sees to that. Fevers and chills… I haven't been ill, Doctor. Just…tired. Are you always this thorough with patients? It feels rather…invasive. I’ve never needed to explain basic bodily functions to a physician before.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm being overly thorough, Mr. Drahota. I just want to be certain we cover everything. Alright, no fever, chills, or weight loss. How about your appetite?
PATIENT: As I just explained, Doctor, my appetite is perfectly normal. Excellent, even. My wife insists on three square meals a day, and often a snack in between. She's a…vigilant woman. Is this relevant? Are you suggesting I'm undernourished? This is becoming rather tedious.
DOCTOR: No, I'm not suggesting that at all, Mr. Drahota. Just ruling things out. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urination?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you quite serious? Now you’re asking me about…that? I find this line of questioning highly inappropriate. I came here because my wife insisted on this nonsense about my skin, not to have a detailed interrogation about my bodily functions! I believe I've answered enough questions. I'd like to see the results of whatever…examination you were planning, and then conclude this visit. Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if these questions feel intrusive. They’re important for a complete picture of your health. However, if you are truly unwilling to answer, we can proceed without them. Would you allow me to quickly examine you?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have wasted enough of my time here. If you cannot provide me with a diagnosis without…invasive questioning and a physical examination, then I see no point in continuing. I will take my leave now. And kindly refrain from asking my wife such…personal questions in the future. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I respect your wishes. Given your reluctance, I can’t provide a definitive diagnosis today. However, based on what you have told me - fatigue and a change in complexion - it could be something simple, such as age-related changes or mild iron deficiency. But without a proper examination and blood work, it's impossible to say for sure. I strongly recommend you consider seeing a specialist for a full workup. I can provide a referral to a hematologist or an internist if you'd like. Regardless, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness – please seek immediate medical attention. Here's my card with the clinic’s number. Please don’t hesitate to call if you change your mind. .
