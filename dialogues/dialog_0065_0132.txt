DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it’s this heat, really. Can’t take it anymore. Makes me feel awful. Always have struggled with it, but this year it's... different. Just feel wiped out, you know? Like all the strength's been sucked right out of me. Not like a sickness, just… weak.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness… and you’re attributing that to the heat?
PATIENT: Attributing? Is that like… blaming? Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? But what else would it be? I haven’t been ill. Just can’t handle the sun like I used to. Used to work all day in it, no problem. Painting houses, building… all that. Now? Five minutes and I’m looking for shade. It’s ridiculous. And it’s not just being tired, it’s… hotter than it should be, even in the shade. Makes my head swim.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. I understand. So, this weakness is new this year, specifically coinciding with the warmer weather. You’re also experiencing feeling unusually warm, even when you’re trying to cool down, and that’s causing you to feel lightheaded?
PATIENT: Lightheaded... yeah, that's a good way to put it. Not dizzy exactly, but… wobbly. Like my legs aren’t quite holding me up. And it’s not just a little warm, it's... like I’m burning up from the inside. I've always been fine in the heat, I tell ya. Strong as an ox. This is… unsettling. You don’t think it's just… getting old, do you? Because that’s what my sister keeps saying. Thinks I’m just losing my stamina. She doesn't understand.
DOCTOR: Your sister's opinion is noted, Mr. Coby. It’s good to consider family history, but we need to look at your specific situation. Now, aside from the heat sensitivity and feeling warm, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... hmm. Let me think. I haven’t been sleeping well, I suppose. Toss and turn all night. Not nightmares or anything, just… restless. And maybe a little bit thirsty, but I drink plenty of water anyway, you know, being outside and all. Oh! And my skin... feels kinda prickly sometimes. Like little needles. Not a rash, just… itchy. Does that make sense? It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Restlessness, increased thirst, and that prickly skin sensation... Okay. Now, let’s go through some standard questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. Still eat the same amount, I guess. Maybe a little less when it's really hot, but mostly just don’t feel like eating much anything when I’m feeling so drained. Normally, I can put away a good plate of dal bhat. You know, the Nepali food. But lately… not so much. It’s not that I’m not hungry, just… don’t enjoy it as much. Everything tastes… flat. Like there’s no flavor. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Interesting. A decreased enjoyment of food, despite a stable appetite… Alright. And have you had any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation lately?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. Stomach's been fine. Regular as clockwork, thankfully. Always been proud of my digestion, even when everything else is falling apart. That's something I haven't lost, anyway. Really, it's just this… heat thing. Makes you wonder if I should just stay indoors all summer. But what's the point of living if you can't work?
DOCTOR: We’re trying to figure out what’s going on, Mr. Coby, and minimizing your work isn’t the immediate goal. Now, let’s talk about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements.
PATIENT: Medications? Just Medicare, you know, for when I need it. Don't take much. A little ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, but nothing regularly. Vitamins? Maybe some multi-vitamins a while back, but I'm terrible at remembering to take them. My sister keeps trying to get me to take all sorts of things, but I don't bother. Natural is best, I always say. Been fine for 62 years without pills, haven't I? It’s just… this year is different.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications, occasional ibuprofen, and no consistent vitamin use. Now, regarding your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Clean as a whistle, mostly. Had the usual childhood illnesses, you know? Measles, mumps… nothing serious. Back went out a few times when I was working construction, but that's about it. Sister keeps harping on getting checkups, but I always put it off. What’s the point if you feel fine? And honestly, doctors these days… always trying to give you a label for everything. Prefer to just tough it out, if you know what I mean. I’m a practical man, not a hypochondriac. This heat… it just feels different this year. Worrying me, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed 'em. Always been careful, you know? And lucky, I guess. Avoided any major accidents, despite doing some dangerous work. Plenty of scrapes and bruises, of course. But never anything that needed a doctor to cut me open. Honestly, I don't trust them with knives. This heat… it’s making me feel like I’m falling apart, though. And it’s not just physical. I’m just… irritable, you know? Snapping at people. Not myself at all. My sister said I was being “difficult” yesterday. She always says that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother, she suffered from arthritis when she got older. Lots of aches and pains, always complaining. Sister's convinced I’m going to end up the same. And… my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had some sort of heart trouble. Died young, actually. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family history. Everyone gets old and sick eventually, right? This heat… it's just… it feels different. It's making me feel weak and fragile. Not like myself at all. And my sister keeps telling me I need to slow down. She just doesn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. A family history of hypertension, arthritis, and heart trouble. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Always thought it was a foolish habit. My father smoked, you know, and it didn't do him any good. Weak lungs, always coughing. No, never touched the stuff. Prefer fresh air, especially when it’s not this stifling heat. And drink? Just a little bit of raksi sometimes, with my meals. Nepali rice wine. Nothing excessive. Keeps me warm in the winter, you know? But nothing that would affect my health. Honestly, I'm a simple man. Just want to work and live a peaceful life. This heat is ruining everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol use. Now, finally, do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but nothing serious. Never had a major reaction to anything. Dust bothers me sometimes, but who doesn’t? Honestly, I'm pretty sturdy. Always been able to handle whatever life throws at me. Except for this heat, that is. It's just… overwhelming. Makes me feel like I'm losing my strength. And my sister keeps saying I need to rest. She just doesn't understand what it's like to be a working man. I need to get back to painting, you know? Got jobs to do. This heat… it's ruining everything. .
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Coby, thank you for that detailed information. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just going to check your vital signs – your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and breathing. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Okay?
