DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I'm a Family Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I am… painful. It’s in my back, mostly. I would like to finish this quickly, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I'll do my best to be efficient. “Painful” is a bit broad, though. Can you tell me more about the pain in your back?
PATIENT: It hurts… a lot. It started a few weeks ago, I think. It’s a dull ache most of the time, but when I move… or try to lift something… it’s a sharp pain. Like someone is sticking a hot needle in me. It makes it hard to work. I erect fences, you see. It requires… lifting.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache with sharp pains when you move, and it’s interfering with your work. Erecting fences is physically demanding. To help me get a better understanding, can you pinpoint exactly where on your back the pain is located?
PATIENT: Right… here. Mostly on this side. Sometimes it feels like it goes around, but it starts here. It’s… hard to explain exactly. It’s not just on the skin, it’s… deeper. Like in the muscle, maybe? I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, predominantly on your left side, and it feels deep, possibly muscular. Has anything specific caused this pain to start, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: No. Nothing I remember. I didn’t fall or lift something too heavy… not that I recall. It just… started. I was working, like normal, and then it was there. I don’t believe I did anything special that day. I have a good memory, you see, and I would remember something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific inciting event. That’s helpful to know. And you said it’s been a few weeks. Has the pain been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Some days are better than others. When I am sitting still, it's not so bad. But when I’m working… or even walking too much… it gets worse. It’s worse at the end of the day, always. I do try to rest, but… well, fences don't erect themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like activity definitely exacerbates it. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Maybe a… four. It’s not unbearable, but it’s there. A constant ache. When I move, it goes up to maybe a six, quickly. I wouldn’t say it’s stopped me from working completely, but it’s very… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four out of ten normally, spiking to a six with movement. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other areas of your body, just to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. My legs feel… normal. I walk alright. I can stand without trouble. No tingling, no numbness, no weakness. I would know if something was wrong with my legs. I need them for work, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you had any trouble with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: I… beg your pardon? I do not understand the question. Is that… relevant? I have no trouble with… those things. I'm sorry. Perhaps you could explain it another way?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Reihner. That was a rather direct question. I was simply checking to see if you had any changes in your bowel or bladder function – any difficulty urinating, any incontinence, or changes in your stool. It’s sometimes related to back pain, but it’s not always. You are correct to question its relevance, and I appreciate you asking me to clarify. The answer is no, you have no changes in bladder or bowel function?
PATIENT: Oh. That. No. Everything is… normal. As it should be. I am glad you explained it. It’s good to know what you are asking, Doctor. Can we move on? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No chills. And my weight has been… stable. I eat the same amount, and weigh the same. I haven't lost any weight. I am a… practical woman, Doctor. I notice these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any history of cancer, or does anyone in your family have a history of cancer?
PATIENT: No. Not me. And… not that I know of. My mother… she passed away when I was young. I don't know much about her family. My father… he didn’t talk about it much. No. I don’t believe so. Nothing I recall. Is this all?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Thank you for answering those questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you don't mind. I'll check your back for tenderness, range of motion, and assess your reflexes and muscle strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick. I have work to do, you see. I hope this will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: I will be as efficient as possible. If you could lie face down for me, please. I’ll start by gently palpating your lower back to check for any areas of tenderness. Does this area feel tender?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes. Right there. That’s… very tender. It feels… sharp, when you press on it. Like a bruise, almost. Be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see. And what about when I ask you to bend forward?
PATIENT: Ow! It hurts. Not… unbearable, but it's very uncomfortable. It's hard to bend all the way. It feels… tight. Like something is pulling.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you bend backwards?
PATIENT: Ow! No… that’s very painful. I can’t go very far. It feels like something is going to… snap. That’s enough of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. No need to push through any pain. Your reflexes are normal, and I don't detect any weakness in your legs. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely on the left side. It doesn't appear to be anything more serious, but it is causing you significant pain and limiting your range of motion. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: No. I do not take any medications. I prefer not to. I try to deal with things myself. What does this mean? What can be done about it? I need to get back to work, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're very resilient, and I respect your preference to avoid medication if possible. For a muscle strain, the typical treatment involves rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. However, given your occupation and the pain you’re experiencing, I would recommend a combination of approaches. First, I recommend you limit strenuous activity for a few days. I know that’s difficult with your work, but it's essential to allow the muscle to heal. Second, apply ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Third, over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage the pain and inflammation. I'm also going to order a course of physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility, which will help prevent future injuries. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… That will take time, won't it? I don’t have much time to spare. But… strengthening my back… that makes sense. And rest… I suppose I can try to take it easier. Over-the-counter pain relievers… alright. As long as they don't have… side effects. So… rest, ice, pain relievers, and physical therapy. Is that all? When can I get back to work?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be mindful of the time commitment and potential side effects. We can discuss options for pain relievers that have minimal side effects. For example, acetaminophen is generally well-tolerated. As for when you can return to work, that depends on how quickly your pain improves. I recommend starting with light activity and gradually increasing your workload as tolerated. Avoid any activities that exacerbate your pain. I'm going to give you a written referral for physical therapy, as well as a prescription for acetaminophen. I’d like to see you back in two weeks to assess your progress. If your pain worsens or doesn't improve after a week, please schedule an earlier appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. And acetaminophen… I will read about that. Thank you. No. I believe that is all. I appreciate your help, Doctor Quicksey. And your… efficiency. I need to get home and rest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And remember to listen to your body. Get well soon. .
