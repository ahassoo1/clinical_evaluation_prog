DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re 81 years old, which means we need to be efficient. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's this…procedure. My daughter insisted. Says my face is “looking tired”. Honestly, the girl has no taste. But, to get her off my back, here I am. Cosmetic surgery clearance, is that what she called it? Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic surgery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. A little lift. Nothing major. I’ve always kept myself presentable, you know. Worked with my hands my whole life – terrazzo, beautiful work. Doesn’t mean I want to look…old. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Terrazzo, hmm. Well, Mr. Orwin, simply wanting a procedure isn't enough for medical clearance. We need to ascertain if you are a suitable candidate. Let’s start with a thorough medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Significant? At my age, everything is significant. Look, I’ve been healthy. Relatively. A bit of arthritis, of course. Normal wear and tear. Had a touch of pneumonia once, years ago. But I bounced back. I don't need a long list of questions. Is this standard procedure? Because frankly, it feels like a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: “Relatively healthy” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Orwin. And yes, it is standard procedure to assess risk before allowing someone your age to undergo elective surgery. Arthritis…which joints?
PATIENT: Honestly, does it matter? They all ache. Knees, mostly. Hands, too. It’s what happens when you spend fifty years on your feet, doing honest work. Not sitting around like some people. I took some pills for it a while back, but they didn’t do much good, so I stopped. Waste of money, if you ask me. Can we please get on with this? I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: The specific joints affected are relevant, Mr. Orwin. It indicates the severity and potential impact on anesthesia and recovery. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. You doctors and your details. Honestly. Let me think… it was a little white pill. Round, I think. No, maybe oblong. Something with an “A” on it. I don’t remember. My wife handled all the medication. She passed away five years ago, you know. It’s all a bit of a blur. Look, I just want to know if I can have this lift or not. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: A little white pill with an “A” on it… remarkably unhelpful, Mr. Orwin. Alright. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never needed any. I’ve always been strong. A few stitches here and there, but nothing serious. Broken a finger once, when I was a young man, working on a job. But they just wrapped it up. No surgery. I avoid doctors whenever possible. Honestly, they just poke and prod and tell you things you don’t want to hear. Is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? Because I really don’t appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, you are making this exceedingly difficult. A complete medical history is essential. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Everything my wife cooked, anyway. She was a wonderful cook. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, people these days are too sensitive. Everything’s an allergy. Look, can we just skip this part? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. Relatively, of course. And perfectly capable of making my own decisions about my face. Is this lift going to hurt? That’s what I want to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, “relatively healthy” and assurances are insufficient. We need factual information. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Besides the occasional aspirin for a headache? No! I told you, I avoid doctors. And pills. They just make you feel worse, if you ask me. Look, I’m wasting my time here. My daughter will be furious if I'm late for the luncheon. Can we just get a simple answer? Yes or no. Am I healthy enough for this lift or not? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I am unable to provide medical clearance based on the incredibly limited and unreliable information you have provided. I strongly recommend you return with a complete medical history, including a list of all past and current medications, allergies, and a detailed account of any previous illnesses or surgeries. Until then, I advise against undergoing any elective procedures. My time is valuable as well. .
