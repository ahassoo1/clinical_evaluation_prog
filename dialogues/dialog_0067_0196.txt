DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… chronic fatigue, I think that’s what the lady on the phone said. Honestly, it's just… being tired. Really tired. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It's been going on a while, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, “chronic fatigue” is a good starting point. It is frustrating when it's been going on for a while and it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. No worries, we’ll try to sort it out. When you say “really tired,” can you describe what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… not just sleepy, you know? Like, I can sleep, but it doesn’t help. It’s more like… heavy. Everything feels heavy. And I have no energy. Even getting out of bed is… a lot. I just want to… sit. A lot. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. It sounds incredibly draining. It's good you're able to describe it like that – the “heavy” feeling and the lack of energy even after sleep is helpful. Let me pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you’ve been seen at our clinic before. I see a note from six months ago mentioning some similar complaints. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little bit more about when this fatigue started?
PATIENT: Six months ago? Oh dear… I… I don't really remember that visit much, I’m afraid. Everything feels a bit… blurry. When did it start… hmm. Honestly, it feels like it’s always been there, a little bit. But maybe… worse in the last year? After… after my husband passed. It’s hard to say. Everything just… changed then. Does that help? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: That does help, Ms. Licano. Significant life changes, like the loss of your husband, can absolutely have a major impact on your energy levels and overall well-being. It’s perfectly understandable that you're not able to pinpoint an exact date. So, it sounds like the fatigue has been present for some time, but has potentially worsened in the last year following your husband’s passing. Aside from the fatigue and heaviness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. I… sometimes I feel a little achy. All over. Not like a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And I’ve been… forgetful. Even more than usual, I mean. My daughter keeps telling me I repeat myself. I don’t mean to! It’s just… things slip my mind. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven't really been keeping track. Honestly, I don’t really have much of an appetite these days. Is that… is that important? I’m sorry, I'm probably rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Licano. This is all very helpful information. The achiness, increased forgetfulness, weight loss, and decreased appetite are all things we need to consider. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if that's alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep besides feeling tired even after sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, go ahead. Changes in my sleep… well, sometimes I have trouble falling asleep. My mind just… races. And then, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. Just lying there. Thinking. It’s not every night, but it happens. And I don’t… I don’t feel rested when I do sleep, even if I get enough hours. It's just… not the same as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty falling asleep, waking up during the night, and not feeling rested even with sufficient sleep. That paints a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in your mood – feeling sad, anxious, or irritable?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, I get… sad sometimes, of course. Missing my husband. But mostly… I just feel… blah. Not really happy, not really sad. Just… empty. And… I guess I get a little more easily frustrated with things. My daughter says I snap at her sometimes, and I don’t mean to. It’s just… everything feels harder now. I'm probably just being a bother. It’s silly, really.
DOCTOR: You are not being a bother at all, Ms. Licano. It sounds like you’re going through a very difficult time, and it’s perfectly normal to feel sad, empty, and more easily frustrated after such a significant loss. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. No, not that I know of. I mean, I went to the doctor regularly with my husband, but I never had any… serious problems. I take a little something for my cholesterol, but that’s it. And… I have Medicare, if that matters. I’m not sure. I don’t really remember all the details. My daughter handles most of that stuff now. Is cholesterol a chronic thing? I'm so sorry, I'm rambling again.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling, Ms. Licano. It’s okay if you don't remember all the details. We’ll figure it out. Cholesterol can be a chronic condition, but it’s easily managed with medication. Okay, so you take medication for cholesterol and have Medicare. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I used to get a little itchy with some perfumes, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? I don't think so. My daughter might know more, she remembers things better than me. I just… I wish I could be more helpful. I feel like I’m wasting your time. I should probably just… stop.
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, you are not wasting my time. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, and it's perfectly alright if you don't remember every detail. It’s common for things to be blurry, especially with everything you’ve been through. Okay, no known allergies. Let’s move on to your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a little girl, I think. A long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy, oh, goodness, maybe 30 years ago? Something like that. It was… routine, I think. Nothing major. And… that’s it, I think. I really can't remember much else. I just… everything feels so far away. Maybe I should just stop trying to remember. It’s probably just my age. .
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and hysterectomy in the past. That’s helpful to know. And it's perfectly understandable that details are fuzzy with time. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. What about your family history?
