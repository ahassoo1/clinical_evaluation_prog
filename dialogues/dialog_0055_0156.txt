DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're twenty years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I’ve been having… problems. A lot of… running to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… annoying. I can’t really remember when it started, exactly. Sorry, I’m not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. Vague recollections are…unhelpful, unfortunately. We need to establish a timeline to understand what we're dealing with. “A bit now” could mean anything. Perhaps you can recall if it coincided with any changes in your diet, travel, or stress levels?
PATIENT: Hmm… diet… I don’t think so. We eat pretty much the same things all the time. My husband does most of the cooking, actually. Travel… no, not recently. We haven’t been anywhere. Stress… well, life is stressful, isn’t it? I don’t know if it’s more stressful than usual. I’m married, and I work… sales, I think? It’s… talking to people a lot. Is that stressful? I honestly can't say. It all feels a bit… blurry. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: “Blurry” is not particularly useful, Ms. Nahrwold. Sales, you say. A demanding profession, certainly. Now, let’s focus on the…symptoms themselves. You mentioned frequent trips to the bathroom. Can you describe the stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s… awkward. It's… watery. Really watery. And… a lot of it. Sometimes there’s… stuff in it, but I don’t really… look, honestly. I just… go. I know that’s not helpful. It's just… unpleasant. Is it important what it looks like? I feel bad even talking about this.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Nahrwold. Ignoring details does not make the problem disappear. The consistency and contents of your stool provide valuable information. “Watery” is a start. Is there any blood?
PATIENT: Blood? I… don't think so. I really don't remember seeing any blood. I mean, I try not to look, like I said. But I don’t think so. No blood. Definitely not. I just know it's… a lot of liquid. And it happens… a lot. Like, multiple times a day. Every day, for… a while now. I wish I could remember how long. Is this… normal? Is something seriously wrong? I'm starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a relative term, Ms. Nahrwold. Frequent, watery stools are certainly not ideal. Now, are you experiencing any abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It's… kind of a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes it gets really bad, like… sharp pains. It feels like… twisting. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely there, especially when I feel like I need to go to the bathroom. And… sometimes I feel nauseous too. Not like I’m going to throw up, but just… queasy. Is that… IBD? I think I heard someone mention that once. Is that what I have?
DOCTOR: IBD is a possibility, Ms. Nahrwold, but jumping to conclusions based on hearsay is… unproductive. We need to gather more information before considering such diagnoses. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot or anything. Chills, no. Weight loss… That’s… maybe? My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t really been weighing myself. My husband might have noticed? He’s always telling me I need to eat more. I don’t know. I haven’t been feeling very hungry lately, to be honest. Everything just feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Uncomfortable” is a rather broad term, Ms. Nahrwold. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I think… when I was little, I had… something with my stomach? The doctor said I couldn't eat certain things. Like… wheat, maybe? And dairy? It was a long time ago. My mum mostly handled all that stuff. I just know I had to be careful about what I ate. She used to make special food for me. I think it was called… celiac, maybe? Or something like that. I haven’t had any problems with it for years, though. I thought I’d grown out of it. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: “Grown out of it” is… uncommon, Ms. Nahrwold, but not impossible. Celiac disease is a significant detail. Do you recall if you've had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And… I think I broke my arm once, when I was little, but I don't really remember it. It was just… a normal kid thing. No big surgeries, or anything like that. Just the tonsils. And maybe the arm. I honestly can’t really recall the details. Sorry. This is probably really frustrating for you.
DOCTOR: “Frustrating” is… an understatement. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… My mum… she had stomach problems sometimes. A lot of bloating, and… discomfort. Like me, I guess. But she never really went to the doctor about it. She just… dealt with it. And my dad… he has high blood pressure, I think? And his mum… she had something with her heart? But that was a long time ago. I don’t really know the details, honestly. We don’t really talk about medical stuff in my family. It’s… a bit of a taboo subject. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: "Taboo" is… inefficient. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Smoking is terrible, and alcohol… I don’t really like the taste. And drugs… absolutely not. My husband doesn’t drink or smoke either. We just… don’t do that sort of thing. We’re pretty healthy people, mostly. Apart from my stomach, of course. I just want to feel better, you know? Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Well… sometimes I take paracetamol for headaches, but that’s it. And occasionally, I take something for indigestion, like… Rennies, I think it’s called? But I haven’t taken anything for a while, not since this… started getting worse. Nothing prescribed, or anything like that. Just the occasional headache tablet, and sometimes Rennies. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it is not inherently “bad”, Ms. Nahrwold, but it is important to document everything. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any reactions to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a problem with any medication. I think I would remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? My mum always said I was pretty robust. So, no allergies. That’s good, right? Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is… marginally helpful. Now, I am going to conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to listen to your abdomen and palpate it gently to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. Is it going to hurt? I’m a bit… sensitive.
DOCTOR: It should not be excessively painful, Ms. Nahrwold. I will be as gentle as possible. I am simply assessing for any areas of discomfort or distension. Please inform me immediately if you experience any sharp or severe pain. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Normal bowel sounds are present… somewhat hyperactive, actually. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s a bit… tender. Not horrible, but… yeah, that’s not very comfortable. It feels… kind of like a cramping pain, actually. Like… when I need to go to the bathroom. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And a little bit painful. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower left quadrant, with reports of cramping pain…consistent with sigmoid colon involvement. No guarding or rebound tenderness present. Abdomen is slightly distended, but soft overall. Bowel sounds are still hyperactive. Okay, Ms. Nahrwold. That concludes the physical examination. Based on your history and the findings of the examination, I suspect… irritable bowel syndrome, potentially with some degree of underlying inflammatory component. However, given your reported history of possible celiac disease, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood tests to assess your inflammatory markers and screen for celiac antibodies. We'll also need a stool sample to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a stool sample? Oh… okay. That sounds… unpleasant. But… if it helps figure out what’s wrong, then… okay. Irritable bowel syndrome… is that… serious? Will I need surgery? And what about the celiac thing? Does that mean I can’t eat anything? I’m really starting to get scared.
DOCTOR: Irritable bowel syndrome is generally not life-threatening, Ms. Nahrwold, although it can be… disruptive. Surgery is rarely required. The treatment typically involves dietary modifications, stress management, and medication to control your symptoms. Regarding the celiac disease, we need to determine if you are currently sensitive to gluten. If you are, it would mean avoiding wheat, barley, and rye. However, there are many gluten-free alternatives available these days. I'm going to write you a requisition for the blood tests and a container for the stool sample. The laboratory is located on the second floor. Please fast for at least eight hours before the blood test. I also want you to keep a detailed food diary for the next week, noting any symptoms you experience after eating specific foods. We’ll review the results in a week, and then we can discuss a more definitive treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding highly processed foods, caffeine, and alcohol. And try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A food diary… okay, I can do that. Um… yes, actually. What if… what if it is celiac disease? What if I have to completely change my diet? My husband does all the cooking, and he… he’s not very adventurous. He makes the same things all the time. And… is there anything I can take now to help with the… running to the bathroom? It’s really embarrassing, and I can’t really go anywhere without worrying about it. And… Is it okay if I call you if I have questions before next week? I feel really lost, and I don't know who else to ask.
DOCTOR: Regarding your husband, Ms. Nahrwold, there are numerous gluten-free recipes available online and in cookbooks. Adapting your diet can be challenging, but it is certainly manageable. And as for your current symptoms, I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication to help control the frequency of your bowel movements. It is a temporary solution, of course, but it may provide some relief until we have the results of the tests. I am writing a prescription for loperamide. Follow the dosage instructions carefully. And yes, you are welcome to call the office if you have any questions before our next appointment. However, please understand that I am a busy physician, and I may not be able to answer the phone immediately. My nursing staff will do their best to assist you. Here are the necessary forms and the prescription. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Loperamide… okay. No, I think that’s everything… for now. Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. I hope… I hope we can figure this out. It’s just… really hard. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nahrwold. I trust the tests will provide us with some clarity. Please follow the instructions carefully, and I will see you next week. .
