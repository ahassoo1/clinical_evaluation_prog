DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need a paper signed, somethin’ about…fixin’ myself up a little. Cosmetic, you said? Don’t rightly remember all the details, honestly. Just want it done quick.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re looking for a form signed regarding cosmetic procedures. However, simply signing a form without a proper consultation would be…unprofessional, and frankly, potentially harmful. It’s my responsibility to ensure any procedure you consider is appropriate and safe for you, Mr. Honcoop. Could you elaborate on what “fixin’ yourself up a little” entails?
PATIENT: Harmful? Look, I been climbin’ towers since before you were born, young lady. I know my own limits. It’s nothin’ dangerous. Just… a little touch-up. Skin, mostly. Saggin’ and such. Ain’t nobody wants to look old. It’s… a lift, I think. That's what the fella at the place said. Don't ask me the details, I just handed over some money and he said I needed a doctor's say-so. Now, can we just get this over with? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your experience, Mr. Honcoop, but even experienced individuals can benefit from a medical assessment. A “lift,” as you put it, could involve various procedures with different risks and benefits. It’s important we determine the best course of action, if any is even appropriate. Before we proceed, let’s go through a basic medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmph. History... Look, I been mostly healthy. Climbin’ keeps a man fit, you know? Blood pressure… maybe a little high sometimes, the wife – bless her soul – used to fuss about it. But I never went to no doctor ‘bout it. Never needed to. Heart? Beatin’ just fine, last time I checked. No fancy diagnoses or nothin’. I work hard, eat okay, and don't cause trouble. Is that good enough? This is gettin’ ridiculous.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your self-assessment, Mr. Honcoop, “okay” is rather vague for medical purposes. Even if you feel healthy, there could be underlying conditions that would make a cosmetic procedure unsafe. Do you take any medications at all, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Bless my soul, no. I ain’t one for all that fancy stuff. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, that’s it. The wife used to keep some, but… well, she’s gone now. No regular pills or nothin’. I don't like bein’ poked and prodded, Doctor. I just want this paper signed and be on my way. Are you gonna help me or what?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I cannot simply sign a form without a proper assessment. It would be negligent and irresponsible of me to do so. You mentioned occasional aspirin use; do you take that regularly, or only when you have a headache?
PATIENT: Look, I told ya! Now and then! When my head's poundin' after a long day on a tower. Not every day, not every week. It’s just… aspirin. You know, the white pills. I ain’t one for complainin’ or takin’ a lot of medicine. Honestly, I'm startin’ to regret comin’ here. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, even infrequent aspirin use can have implications, particularly before a procedure. It affects blood clotting. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never had no allergies. Bees stung me a few times climbin’ around, but I didn't die, did I? A little swellin', that’s all. Never been bothered by nothin’ else. Look, is this gonna take all day? I got a schedule to keep. This tower ain't gonna fix itself.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed any further, I need to conduct a brief physical exam. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Honcoop, and it will help me determine if you are a suitable candidate for… whatever procedure this facility has discussed with you. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exam... Look, I ain't got time for a whole rigamarole. Just… look me over quick. Check my pulse or somethin'. No pokin' and proddin', you hear? I got work to do, Doctor. And I ain't dressed for no exam. This is gettin' out of hand. I need that paper signed. Now, are you gonna help me or not? Don't waste my time with fancy tests and questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re pressed for time. However, a basic assessment is non-negotiable. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and visually inspect the area where this procedure is planned. That's all. No extensive probing, I assure you. Please remove your shirt and sit on the examination table. It will only take a few moments. And I need to strongly advise against proceeding with any procedure until I have a clearer understanding of your overall health. Are you willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. And be professional, you hear? I ain't comfortable takin' my shirt off in front of… well, anyone. Just get it over with. But I'm tellin' ya, if this takes long, I'm walkin' out. Now, where's this…table? And don't you go starin'. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat, Mr. Honcoop. I assure you, I am simply conducting a professional assessment. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and visually inspect the area in question. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated - 145 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. And I notice some sun damage on your skin, as expected, given your occupation. There's also some thinning skin and a loss of elasticity. Now, could you tell me specifically what you were hoping to achieve with this procedure?
PATIENT: Hmph. Specific... Look, I just want it tighter. All this saggin' makes me look old. The fella at the place showed me pictures. Smoothed it all out. Said it was easy. I just want to look…presentable. Wife used to say I looked handsome, but that was a long time ago. Don’t rightly remember what the fella called it, just a lift or somethin'. He said this paper was all that was needed. Now, is it gonna work or not? Don’t need a lecture about the sun, I been climbin’ towers for forty years.
DOCTOR: A "lift," as you say, likely refers to a surgical procedure such as a facelift or arm lift. However, given your elevated blood pressure, thinning skin, and overall health, proceeding with surgery carries a significant risk of complications. Your skin is fragile, and surgical intervention could lead to poor wound healing, infection, or even skin necrosis. Frankly, Mr. Honcoop, I strongly advise against surgery at this time. It is not in your best interest. However, there are some non-surgical options we could explore – treatments to improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of sagging, but they will not provide the same dramatic results as surgery. Would you be interested in discussing those options?
PATIENT: Hmph. Non-surgical… what does that even mean? No cuttin' and stitchin'? It ain’t gonna work, is it? Look, I ain’t payin’ for somethin’ that ain’t gonna fix it. I just want to look younger, like I used to. The fella at the place said… well, never mind. He's probably tryin' to take my money. So, you're sayin’ it’s a waste of time and money? Just gonna have to live with lookin’ like an old man? Now, can I get dressed? This is gettin' ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: I am saying that surgery at this time poses a greater risk than benefit to your health. Non-surgical options, such as radiofrequency skin tightening or dermal fillers, may offer some improvement in skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines, but they will not replicate the results of a surgical facelift. However, they are a safer alternative. If you are interested, I can provide you with information on local specialists who offer these treatments. I can also write you a referral for a cardiology consultation to help manage your blood pressure. Addressing that will be the most important step, regardless of whether you pursue cosmetic treatments. You are free to get dressed. And I will write that referral now. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Hmph. A heart doctor? Look, I ain’t got time for all that. I feel fine. Climbin’ keeps a man fit, you know? No need for fancy tests and doctors. Just… forget it. Forget the whole thing. Write down the fella's name, the one that said he could do the lift. Maybe he knows someone who… well, never mind. I gotta go. This has been a complete waste of my time. Absolutely ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. Here is the name and number of the facility you mentioned. However, I must reiterate my strong recommendation that you discuss your medical history with a cardiologist before proceeding with any elective procedure. Your health is the most important thing, Mr. Honcoop. Please take care of yourself. .
