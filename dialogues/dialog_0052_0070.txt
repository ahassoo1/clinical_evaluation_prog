DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Shely, you say? Yes, yes. Fine name. I… moved here. New. Doctor things. Medicare, you know? Just… checking. Old man things. Not much wrong, hopefully. Just need to be sure.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very wise to establish care when you move, and preventative care is always a good idea. “Old man things” can be anything, so let’s start with a bit more detail. Perhaps you could tell me about any specific symptoms or concerns you do have, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmph. What is… symptoms? Like a cold? No cold. Maybe… tired. Always a little tired. Old, you know? And my… hands. They shake a bit. Not always, just… sometimes. When I’m working. I do makeup. For the… theater. Used to be big, very big. Now… not so much. But hands shake. That’s bad, yes?
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re experiencing some fatigue and a tremor in your hands, particularly when you are working. You mentioned doing makeup for the theater – that requires a steady hand! And you feel the tremor is something new or worsening?
PATIENT: Worsening, yes. Maybe. It’s hard to say. Things… fade, you know? Memory. Like a bad dye job. Used to be, I could paint anything. Delicate work. Now… it’s a struggle. Not as good. People still ask, but… it takes longer. And longer is bad. They don’t want to wait. And the shaking… it makes it look messy. Very messy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have your skills affected, and the tremor is certainly concerning. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe the tremor?
PATIENT: Describe? How to… describe a shaking hand? It… jiggles. Like jelly. Not always, you understand. Sometimes it's just a little… twitch. Other times, it’s… worse. When I’m nervous, maybe? Or tired. It’s in both hands, but the left one is… worse. Always the left. Bad luck hand, my grandmother used to say. Stupid old woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that description, Mr. Szmyd. “Jiggling” and occurring more with nervousness or fatigue – that's helpful. And you mentioned it’s predominantly in your left hand. Now, aside from the tremor and fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. My… feet. Sometimes they feel… numb. Like pins and needles. Not all the time. When I walk too much, maybe. Or when it’s cold. And… I forget things. You said that already, I think. Names. Faces. Where I put my… brushes. Very annoying. My wife… used to remind me. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have fatigue, a tremor in both hands – worse on the left – numbness in your feet that seems to be worse with walking or cold exposure, and some memory difficulties. You mentioned your wife used to remind you, and I understand that can be frustrating. Has anything specific changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Recent? Well… the move, of course. Big change. Everything is different. New apartment, new people… no one knows my work. And… the divorce. That was… last year. A long time ago, but… it still feels fresh sometimes. She… didn’t understand the theater. Said it was… frivolous. Stupid woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Szmyd. Significant life changes like a move and a divorce can certainly contribute to feelings of fatigue and stress. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmph. Old man problems, mostly. High blood pressure, the doctor said. Gave me pills. I took them for a while. Didn't seem to do much, so I… stopped. And… arthritis. In my hands, of course. Makes it harder to paint. They ache. And… I think I had pneumonia, once. Long time ago. In the army. Bad winter. That’s it, I think. Nothing else important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure – currently off medication – arthritis in your hands, and pneumonia in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Used to be, my wife was always making me special diets. Very annoying. She said I was eating too much salt. But a man needs salt! Makes the food taste better. No allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for the pain. For the hands. Arthritis, you know? I get it at the… pharmacy. Little white pills. Can’t remember the name. Helps a little. And… sometimes I take something for sleep. But not every night. Just when I can’t… switch off the brain. Too many memories.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take something for arthritis pain and occasionally something to help you sleep. Do you know the names of these medications, even approximately?
PATIENT: Names? No. I just ask the… man at the counter. He knows what I need. Little white pills for the hands. Something with an “A” in the name, maybe? And the sleep… blue ones. Small, blue pills. That’s all I know. I don’t bother with names. Too many things to remember already.
DOCTOR: I understand. However, it’s important for me to know the exact names of any medications you’re taking, even over-the-counter ones, to ensure they aren’t interacting with anything else and to understand their potential side effects. Perhaps we can look at your pharmacy records?
PATIENT: Pharmacy records? You mean… call them? Hmph. Sounds… complicated. I don’t like people looking at my things. Private, you know? I just go in, ask for the pills, pay, and leave. Don’t want to bother with records. Too much trouble. And… I don’t trust computers. They steal your information.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about privacy and trust, Mr. Szmyd. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. However, having a complete list of your medications is crucial for your safety. If you're uncomfortable with me contacting your pharmacy directly, perhaps you could bring in the bottles of the medications you're taking to your next appointment?
PATIENT: Bottles… Yes. I suppose I could do that. Bring the bottles. It’s… a bit of a mess in the apartment, to be honest. Lots of boxes. But I’ll try. Next appointment, you say? When is that? I don’t like making plans. Too much… responsibility.
DOCTOR: That would be wonderful, Mr. Szmyd. Just bring them when it's convenient for you. As for the appointment, how about next Tuesday at 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: Tuesday… 10:00? Hmph. Sounds… early. But alright. Tuesday at 10:00. I suppose I can manage that. Now… is that all? I have things to do. Important things. Like… rearranging my brushes. Very important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, that’s all for today. We’ve covered a lot of important information. I recommend bringing the medication bottles to your appointment next Tuesday. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – particularly severe tremors, numbness, or difficulty with balance – please seek immediate medical attention. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Szmyd. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before your appointment.
PATIENT: Pleasure meeting you too. Shely, was it? Yes. Fine name. And… alright. I’ll try to remember the bottles. And… if I fall over, I’ll call. Stupid old man things. Good day.
