DOCTOR: Hi Darl, welcome! I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Lovely to meet you. Let me see… well, it’s about my blood. My… someone told me I should know what type it is. For… things. I don’t quite remember exactly what things, but it seemed important. It’s just… slipped my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're thinking about this! Knowing your blood type can be helpful in certain situations. So, you'd like to find out your blood type today?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Find it out. If you can. It’s… been a long time since I’ve had any tests done, you see. I used to work with… ropes, mostly. Rigging, they called it. Lots of heights! But that was years and years ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just take a look at your records here… Hmm, it doesn’t look like we have a recent blood type on file. And the rigging work… generally no, that wouldn’t directly impact needing to know your blood type, but thanks for letting me know. It's good to have a complete picture. To get this done, we'll need to do a quick blood draw. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood draw? Oh dear. I… don’t particularly like needles, if I'm being honest. But if it’s important… yes, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And you’ll be gentle, won't you? It’s been a while, as I said. I hope I don’t faint.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. Many people feel anxious about needles, you're not alone at all. We'll take it slow, and I'll be as gentle as possible. We have a very skilled phlebotomist who can do the draw for you. It usually only takes a few minutes, and we’ll have you sit or lie down if you’re worried about feeling faint. Before we head over to the lab, do you have any allergies to latex or any blood-thinning medications you take?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. I'm pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything. And medications… well, just a little something for my knees, sometimes. But nothing that thins the blood, no. Just… keeps the ache away. A small white pill. I can’t remember the name, unfortunately. Old age, you know. It steals everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And don’t worry about the name of the pill—we can look that up later if needed. Just to be thorough, have you had any problems with bleeding easily – like bruising more than usual, or prolonged bleeding from cuts?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a bump or a scrape like anyone, but nothing that’s… worrisome. I used to be very careful with the ropes, you see. Always had to be. A little nick could be… bad. But that was a long time ago, and I was very skilled. I don’t think I’ve had any problems with bleeding more than usual. My knees ache more than anything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s reassuring. Alright, let’s go ahead and get you over to the lab for the blood draw. It will just be a small sample. After that, we’ll wait for the results, which usually take about 15-20 minutes. I’ll come find you as soon as they're ready. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Fifteen to twenty minutes, you say? That won't be long. And you’ll come and find me? Wonderful. I’m not very good at navigating these places anymore. Lead the way, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with my… forgetfulness. It’s a curse, really.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all! It’s perfectly normal, and I’m happy to help. Let’s go. The lab is just down the hall to the left. And don't worry about a thing—I’ll come get you as soon as the results are back. I'll also explain what your blood type means and why it's helpful to know.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you. Explain it to me, you say? Wonderful. Sometimes I feel like I’m losing my marbles, you know. It’s good to have someone explain things. Lead the way, Doctor. And… is it warm in here, or is it just me?
DOCTOR: It can get a little warm in here, you’re not alone! We try to keep it comfortable for everyone. It’s probably a combination of the temperature and being a bit nervous. Alright, let's head in. The lab technician, Maria, is wonderful. She’ll take good care of you. Just a quick prick, and then we’ll wait for the results. We can sit comfortably in the waiting room after. Sound good?
PATIENT: A quick prick… yes. As long as it’s quick. And Maria, you say? I hope she’s gentle. I used to be so steady, you know. Climbing those ropes, never a wobble. But… well. Yes, let’s go. A quick prick, and then a sit down. That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You're a good woman.
DOCTOR: You were very brave climbing those ropes, I can imagine! And you’re very welcome. Maria is excellent, she’ll be very gentle, I promise. Here we are… Just tell her you’re here for a blood type test, and she’ll get you all set up. I’ll be right outside, so just let me know if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate. I'll check on you in about 10 minutes.
PATIENT: Right. Blood type test. Gentle… yes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so kind. All this… modern medicine. It’s a bit overwhelming, you know? But you make it easier. Here goes nothing, I suppose. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Darl. Take your time, and I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all.
