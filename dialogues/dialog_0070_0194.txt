DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I think. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And…my family. There’s a bit of a history, you see. It’s all a bit muddled in my head, to be honest. It’s the hearing and…dizziness. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some bothersome ear issues, potentially with some dizziness, and you’re also concerned about family history. That’s perfectly alright; it’s common for things to feel a bit muddled. Let's take it one step at a time. First, regarding your ears – when did you first notice them acting up?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s…a good question. It feels like a long time ago, now. Maybe…a few months? Or was it last year? It’s hard to say, really. It comes in waves, you see. Sometimes I feel fine, and then…whoosh! Everything spins, and my ears…feel blocked, I think. Or…empty? It’s difficult to explain. I don’t remember a specific moment it started, just that it’s been happening on and off.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s been a gradual onset over several months, coming and going in waves, with sensations of fullness or emptiness in your ears, and some dizziness. That’s helpful to know. When you say dizziness, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it’s not like I’m going to fall over, not usually. It's more like… the room is swaying. Or I’m swaying, I don’t know which. Everything feels off balance. Like I’ve been on a boat, maybe? I haven’t been on a boat in years, but that’s the closest I can describe it. And sometimes… a sort of pressure in my head with it. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, but it’s… unsettling. I have to sit down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Mayhugh. It sounds like you’re experiencing episodes of vertigo – that swaying sensation – accompanied by a feeling of imbalance and sometimes pressure in your head. It’s good that the episodes are relatively brief. Now, have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmm… that’s a tricky one. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. Sometimes it happens when I’m… busy, I think? Like at work. But other times, I’m just relaxing, and it hits me. I work at the… the gambling place, you know? Helping people. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing, really. I wish I knew what brought it on. It’s just…random, I suppose. Does that help? I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: It's alright that it seems random. Often, these things don’t have an obvious trigger. Working in a busy environment could certainly be a factor, though. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s another thing I struggle with. I’ve been to doctors, of course, over the years, but… I don’t really remember what they told me. I had something with my… blood pressure, I think? A long time ago. And… arthritis, maybe? In my hands. But nothing major, I don’t think. I’m on Medicare, so they keep an eye on things. I’m not very good at remembering names of things, you see. It all gets jumbled up. I just try to take my pills, when I remember.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don’t remember specifics. We can look at your records to clarify. You mentioned high blood pressure and possible arthritis – that’s a good starting point. Let me just access your EHR here for a moment. Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension – high blood pressure – about ten years ago, and osteoarthritis, primarily in your hands, about five years ago. You also have a history of occasional urinary tract infections. Is that consistent with what you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That sounds right. Hypertension… that’s it! And the arthritis, yes, my hands do ache sometimes. And…oh dear, the water infections. Yes, I do get those now and then. Thank you for looking that up for me. It’s good to know someone is keeping track of things! My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. I appreciate you reminding me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s my pleasure. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I think I take a pill for my blood pressure. A little white one. And sometimes something for the arthritis when my hands are really bad. But… honestly, I’m not very organized. I have a little box at home, but I often forget what’s what. My daughter helps me sometimes, refills the prescriptions, things like that. I’m really not sure what I’m taking right now, to be perfectly honest. I should probably write it down, shouldn't I? It’s just… difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright. We can work with this. We’ll review your medication list in your EHR as well. Okay, it looks like you are currently prescribed lisinopril 10mg daily for your blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for osteoarthritis pain. Is that consistent with what you were describing?
