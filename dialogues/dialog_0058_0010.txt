DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, to be honest. I’ve noticed some swelling, mostly in my… I think it’s my face, but perhaps other places too? My memory isn’t the best, so I’m struggling to recall exactly when it started or what might have caused it. It feels… recent, though.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Swelling, you say. And you're having trouble pinpointing when it started. Okay. "Recent" is… helpful, I suppose. Can you be a little more specific about where on your face?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It seems most noticeable here, on my cheeks, and… around my eyes, perhaps a little on my forehead. It’s not terribly painful, just… puffy, I suppose. It’s hard to tell if it’s gotten worse, honestly. Like I said, remembering details is… difficult for me. Is that alright? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Jahaad. We’ll figure it out. It’s good you’re here. Now, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Let me see… Not that I can recall, no. My routine is fairly… consistent. I work, I eat, I sleep. I haven’t travelled anywhere, or… started any new medications, to my knowledge. I had a dental check-up last month, but everything seemed fine then. Oh! And I did try a new brand of face wash a few weeks ago, but I stopped using it when I noticed my skin felt a little irritated. Could that be it, perhaps? I truly am sorry for being so unsure.
DOCTOR: A new face wash… and you stopped using it when you noticed irritation. Okay. And what kind of irritation?
PATIENT: It wasn't… a burning, exactly. More of a… redness, and a little bit of itching. It wasn’t severe, so I didn’t think much of it at the time. It's just... the swelling started around the same time, I believe. It's quite possible I'm misremembering the timeline, though. My apologies. It’s difficult to be precise.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to rule things out systematically. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever, no chills. No cough, no sore throat, nothing like that. I feel… generally well, aside from this swelling. My appetite is normal, and I’ve been sleeping soundly. It's just... concerning, naturally, to wake up one day and notice a change. Perhaps it's simply allergies? Though I haven't noticed any sneezing or runny nose, which is unusual if it were that, isn’t it? I’m really trying to be helpful, I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad. Let's take a look. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. It’ll be fairly straightforward – I'll check your vital signs, and take a look at your face and neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed at your own pace. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your vital signs are within normal limits. I’m feeling some slight swelling in your lymph nodes, but nothing dramatically concerning. And as I suspected, there is some swelling around your eyes and face. It’s fairly symmetrical, which is… good. But it’s still swelling. Now, do you have any kidney problems, or have you been diagnosed with any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Kidney problems… no, to my knowledge. I’ve never been told I have any issues with my kidneys. And autoimmune conditions… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing chronic or requiring long-term treatment. My family history is… fairly unremarkable, I believe. My mother had high blood pressure, but that’s the extent of it, I think. I sincerely apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. It’s frustrating not to be able to recall more details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad. Given your symptoms, the lack of fever or other systemic signs, and the history of recent face wash use, it's possible this is a localized allergic reaction, or a mild form of contact dermatitis. However, given your difficulty with recall, and the swelling I’m detecting, I want to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some basic bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I completely understand your caution, and I’m happy to undergo any tests you deem necessary. It’s reassuring to know you’re being thorough. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment entirely.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll get the lab order sent over now. You can go to the lab downstairs – they'll need a blood sample. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any new skincare products or potential irritants. If the swelling worsens significantly, or you develop any other symptoms – like difficulty breathing, a rash, or a fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all very clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, and for taking such good care of me. I appreciate your patience with my… memory issues. I’ll head downstairs to the lab now, and I’ll be sure to avoid any new products in the meantime. And I’ll keep an eye out for any worsening symptoms, of course. Thank you again, Doctor Todoroovich.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jahaad. You’re welcome. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
PATIENT: .
