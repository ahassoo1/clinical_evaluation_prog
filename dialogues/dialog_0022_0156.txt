DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It's been… off. Really off, for a while now. I keep getting… diarrhea. It's just… constant. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, “off” and constant diarrhea. I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “forever,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, “forever” isn’t helpful, is it? Okay, let me think… maybe… a few months? Three or four? It’s hard to say. Things just… blur together, you know? It’s been a stressful time. I think it got worse recently, though. Definitely more frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, with it getting worse recently. That gives us a starting point. And you mentioned it’s been a stressful time. Can you tell me a little more about that stress?
PATIENT: It’s… personal stuff. Work’s been okay, just sales, you know? But… my husband and I have been having a hard time. Arguments, mostly. Nothing huge, but it’s just… draining. And I think I’ve been eating… badly. Lots of takeout, not much cooking. I don't really feel like cooking lately. Does that make sense? I just… don't have much energy.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jase. Stress and changes in diet can definitely affect your stomach. So, frequent diarrhea for three or four months, worsened recently, coinciding with some personal stress and a change in diet towards more takeout. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes I feel really tired, even after sleeping. And… my stomach cramps a lot. Not always with the diarrhea, sometimes just randomly. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t really been checking. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? I don’t know if that counts. Oh! And sometimes I get really bloated, like I’ve eaten a ton of air. That's awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, stomach cramps, possible weight loss, and bloating. That gives us a good picture. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I… I think so? A couple of times. It wasn’t a lot, just… streaks. I kind of… ignored it, hoping it would go away. It scared me a bit, to be honest. I didn’t really know what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me that, Jase. It’s good you mentioned it, even though it’s understandably scary. Streaks of blood in your stool are something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. I guess. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Tosca. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I don’t really like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem a little hyperactive, which can be common with diarrhea. And I’m gently pressing on your abdomen. Do you feel any pain or tenderness anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: Ow… yeah, there. That’s… a little tender. Not awful, but… yeah, definitely there. It’s not constant, just when you push. And… sometimes it hurts there even without touching it, just… a dull ache. Does that mean something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left quadrant with a dull ache. That’s helpful information. Given your symptoms – the diarrhea for several months, the recent increase in frequency, the blood in your stool, and the tenderness now – I want to rule out a few possibilities. I'd like to order a stool test to check for infection and inflammation. And a blood test to check for anemia and rule out any other underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Tests sound… good. I just want to know what’s wrong. Whatever you need to do, Dr. Tosca. Just tell me what I have to do. And… how long will it take to get the results? I really hope it’s not anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get this sorted out. The stool test involves collecting a small sample, and I'll give you instructions on how to do that properly. The blood test will just be a routine draw from your arm. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?
PATIENT: Um… nothing really makes it better, to be honest. It's just… always there. But… when I eat dairy, it definitely gets worse. Like, much worse. And… spicy food is a bad idea. Also, stress makes it worse, obviously. Like, if I have a big argument with my husband, it’s guaranteed to flare up. Does that make sense? It feels like everything sets it off, really.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Jase. Avoiding dairy and spicy foods, and managing stress, are good first steps. It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, but the stool tests are important to rule out other possibilities like infections or inflammatory bowel disease. I'm going to write up the orders for the lab tests now. I'll also give you a handout about IBS with information about diet and stress management. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Tosca. I really appreciate you listening. It's just been… a long few months, and I'm glad we're finally trying to figure it out. I'll try to avoid dairy and spicy food, and I'll definitely try to stay hydrated. Is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. It is a long few months, and you’re right to want to get to the bottom of it. For now, let's focus on the stool test and blood work. I'll also give you information on over-the-counter medications like loperamide, which can help to slow down diarrhea, but it's best to use these sparingly and as directed. Do not hesitate to call the clinic if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool that's more than just streaks. Those would be signs we need to investigate further immediately. Here are the orders and the handout. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Tosca. I really appreciate your help. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as I can. And I’ll call if anything changes. I think… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment once the results are back. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
