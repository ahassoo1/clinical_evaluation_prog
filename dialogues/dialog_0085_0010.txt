DOCTOR: Hello, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm a family medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Lahn. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about some swelling, actually. It’s… it’s a bit hard to explain precisely. It came on rather gradually, I think. Honestly, my memory isn't the best, so pinpointing when is difficult. It’s mostly in my… ankles and feet, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It is helpful to get a sense of when things started, even if it's approximate. Gradual onset swelling in the ankles and feet… that gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a bit more about the swelling itself?
PATIENT: It’s… soft swelling, not hard. And it seems worse at the end of the day, definitely. Like, after I’ve been on my feet a lot. It’s not painful, usually. Just… uncomfortable. And sometimes a little bit achy, maybe? I really wish I could be more specific, I apologize. It's just… things slip my mind easily these days.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It's very common for things to be difficult to recall precisely, and you’re doing great. So, soft swelling, worse at the end of the day after being on your feet, and sometimes a little achy… okay. Does anything relieve the swelling?
PATIENT: Um… yes, actually. When I… when I elevate my legs, it does seem to help. Putting my feet up for a bit. And… cold compresses, I think. Though I haven’t done that in a while. I'm not sure if that was just wishful thinking, honestly. It’s hard to keep track. Also, sometimes compression socks, though I don’t enjoy wearing them for extended periods.
DOCTOR: Alright, elevation, cold compresses, and compression socks seem to offer some relief. That's helpful to know. Now, let's get a bit more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. I… I haven't noticed anything specifically related to the swelling, no. I've been feeling a bit more tired lately, but I always assumed that was just… life, you know? I haven't had any pain anywhere else, no fever, no shortness of breath… just the tiredness and the swelling. And maybe… a bit of dizziness sometimes, but that's infrequent. I hope that’s useful information.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and infrequent dizziness alongside the swelling. Thank you. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… It’s… a bit sparse, to be honest. I haven’t had many serious illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. And I broke my arm once when I was a child. As an adult… I’ve had occasional colds and flu, but nothing major. I don't have any chronic conditions that I’m aware of, and I’m not currently taking any medications. I’ve always been relatively healthy, I think. Does that sound alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No chronic conditions, no current medications. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Lahn. No surgeries at all. Never needed them, thankfully. I… I’m not really one for hospitals, if you understand. I try to avoid them whenever possible. So, no surgeries. I can confidently say that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family isn’t very forthcoming with medical details, to be honest. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some heart problems, but I don’t know the specifics. Beyond that, I don’t have a lot of information. We weren’t very close, and health discussions weren’t common. I apologize for the lack of detail; it’s not something I’ve ever been able to provide much information on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Jahaad. It's common for families to not openly discuss medical history. High blood pressure in your mother and some heart problems in your grandfather—that's helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Lahn, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked, and I have no interest in tobacco products. I find them quite unpleasant, actually. I've always prioritized my health, as much as I am able to, and that includes avoiding things like smoking.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Occasionally. I might have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, perhaps once or twice a month. Nothing excessive, certainly. I don’t drink regularly, and I certainly don't binge drink. It’s more of a social thing, really. I wouldn’t consider myself a drinker at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Um… that's a bit of a complicated question. I try to exercise, yes. I walk when I can, mostly. But with my work… it’s difficult to find the time, and honestly, my energy levels aren’t always the best. So, it’s not as regular as I’d like it to be. Maybe two or three times a week, if I’m lucky. It’s not strenuous exercise, just… walking. A moderate pace. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate walking a few times a week. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so, no. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication that I’m aware of. I have a slight sensitivity to certain perfumes, sometimes, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just… makes me sneeze a bit. So, no known allergies, as far as I can tell. I can confidently say that. It's something I would definitely remember, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you, Jahaad. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles and feet. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Lahn, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand it’s necessary to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Blood pressure is 138/86. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's take a look at your ankles and feet. I notice some mild pitting edema in both ankles – that’s the swelling that remains after I press on the area. The skin is warm to the touch, and there’s no redness or signs of injury. No significant pain with palpation. Okay, so those are my initial findings. The swelling is consistent with edema, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. I’d like to order some blood work and a urine test to get a better picture of what's going on. The blood work will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. The urine test will check for protein, which can sometimes indicate kidney problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Lahn, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work and a urine test… I trust your judgment entirely. Whatever you think is best to determine the cause of this swelling, I’m happy to comply with. It’s just… a little unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. But I understand these tests are necessary. Will the results take long? And will they be… painful? I hope not, if you don't mind me asking.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jahaad. It is unsettling when something is going on that you can't quite pinpoint. The blood work and urine test are quite standard, and they shouldn't be painful at all. The blood draw might be a little pinch, but it's very quick. As for the results, the lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get them back to us. We'll review them together as soon as they're available, and then we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your legs whenever possible, and staying hydrated. Also, try to reduce your salt intake a bit, as that can contribute to fluid retention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… reduce salt intake, elevate legs, stay hydrated… yes, I can do that. It doesn’t sound too difficult. My only question, Doctor Lahn, is… what are the possible causes of this swelling? You mentioned kidney problems, but are there other things it could be? I don’t want to cause unnecessary alarm, but… it's difficult not to worry, you understand. I tend to overthink things sometimes.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Jahaad. It’s good to be informed, and it’s perfectly normal to worry when you’re experiencing something new. There are several possible causes of edema, or swelling in the ankles and feet. Kidney problems are one possibility, as is heart failure, although your heart sounds clear and your blood pressure isn’t drastically elevated, which makes that less likely. It can also be caused by venous insufficiency, which is a condition where the veins in your legs have trouble returning blood to your heart. Sometimes, it's simply caused by prolonged standing or sitting, or even certain medications. Less commonly, it can be a sign of a more serious condition like liver disease or thyroid problems, which is why the blood work is so important—it will help us rule those out. The tests aren't meant to alarm you, but to gather information and make an accurate diagnosis. We'll discuss all the possibilities once the results are in, and develop a plan tailored to your specific situation. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: That… that makes sense. So, it could be a number of things. It’s good to know that it’s not necessarily something serious. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. I trust your judgment, Doctor Lahn. And I'll make sure to follow your recommendations—elevate my legs, stay hydrated, reduce salt intake. When should I expect to hear back about the test results? And how will you contact me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. As for the test results, you should expect to hear back within 48 hours, but often sooner. Our office will call you with the results. If we need to discuss them in more detail or schedule a follow-up appointment, the receptionist will coordinate that for you. The phone number we have on file is [pauses, checking chart] 555-123-4567. Is that still the best number to reach you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Lahn, that is still the correct number. 555-123-4567. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing that we're taking steps to figure out what's going on. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I think that concludes everything. Is there anything else you require from me at this time?
DOCTOR: No, Jahaad, that’s everything. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before we get the results back. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. Take care and try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Lahn. You as well. And I will certainly try to remain calm. Goodbye. .
