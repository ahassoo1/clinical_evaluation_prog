DOCTOR: Right. Mr. AlCorta, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Memmolo, it’s my sight. It’s…diminishing, shall we say. Not suddenly, mind you. It's been a gradual thing, but it's gotten to the point where I find myself needing…assistance with tasks I used to do without a second thought. Reading, primarily. And discerning faces. It's quite inconvenient, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Diminishing sight…gradual onset…reading and faces. Right. How long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep precise records of such things. It’s not as though I marked it on a calendar. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a bit longer. It's difficult to say definitively. It wasn't immediately noticeable, you understand. More of a… creeping sensation. It’s frustrating, really. A man should be able to rely on his senses.
DOCTOR: Six months… creeping sensation… Very well. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me consider… No, not particularly. No pain, no spots, no…flashes of light, or anything dramatic like that. Just…less clarity. Things seem…faded, I suppose. Though, I have been feeling rather fatigued lately. But I attribute that to… well, life, mostly. It's hardly a medical marvel, being tired.
DOCTOR: Fatigue… Right. Any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Goodness, no. My family are…were…sturdy folk. Farmers, mostly. Cherokee, you understand. We didn't have time for such…modern ailments. Though, my ex-wife’s side…they had a fondness for sweets, I recall. If that counts for anything. But I assure you, Doctor, I’ve always been rather…disciplined in my eating habits. It's all about moderation, you see.
DOCTOR: Moderation… Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? No, I pride myself on avoiding such things. Natural remedies are far more effective, in my opinion. As for allergies…well, I react rather poorly to incompetence, if that qualifies. But physically? No, nothing of note. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant experience with some pollen a few years back. A rather severe sneeze, if I recall correctly. But hardly an allergy, Doctor. Just…a temporary irritation.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look at your eyes. If you'll just have a seat, please. It's difficult to assess things without a proper examination. And please, try to be still. I haven’t got all day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I find this rather…unnecessary. A thorough questioning should suffice, in my estimation. But if you insist…
DOCTOR: Follow my light… yes… and the other eye… hmm. Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but…visual acuity is significantly reduced. Approximately 20/60 in both eyes. I'm going to check your peripheral vision now. I need you to look straight ahead and tell me when you can see this pen in my hand.
PATIENT: 20/60, you say? That is rather…suboptimal. And this pen… Honestly, Doctor, the angle is rather poor. I’m hardly a hawk. I believe I see a…flicker of something to the…left? Though it’s difficult to be certain. Perhaps you should use a more…prominent object. And adjust the lighting, if you don't mind. It’s all rather…dim in here.
DOCTOR: Peripheral vision is… limited. There's some constriction in the temporal fields bilaterally. Alright. It seems we need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order some basic blood work – just to check your glucose levels and rule out any systemic issues. And I’m referring you to an ophthalmologist. They can perform a more detailed examination of your eyes and determine the underlying cause of your vision loss.
PATIENT: Blood work? An ophthalmologist? Honestly, Doctor, this seems rather…excessive. Are you implying there’s something seriously amiss? I assure you, I’ve always been a picture of health. A few tests, perhaps, but a specialist… It feels rather…alarmist, don’t you think? I suppose, if you insist. But I expect a thorough explanation of the rationale behind all of this. And I trust these…tests won’t be overly disruptive to my schedule. I have commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: The blood work is standard procedure, Mr. AlCorta. And a referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary to determine the cause of your vision loss. It could be a number of things, from glaucoma to macular degeneration. I am not going to speculate without a proper evaluation. The requisition details the tests. The referral form has the contact information for a specialist. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I’ve documented my findings and recommendations in your chart. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Glaucoma…macular degeneration… Honestly, Doctor, you’re not instilling much confidence, I must say. Very well. I shall…consult these specialists, though I remain skeptical of the necessity. And I trust these…tests won’t involve any unpleasant procedures? I have a low tolerance for discomfort, you understand. No, I believe that is all, Doctor. Though I do expect a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. And perhaps, a more…optimistic prognosis. I appreciate your…time. Though I still maintain this entire exercise feels rather…unnecessary.
