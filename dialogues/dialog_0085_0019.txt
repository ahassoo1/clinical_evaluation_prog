DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me? My wife... she want baby. We old, you know? I think… planning? Yes, planning for baby. We want to know… is okay? Is possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You and your wife are hoping to start a family. That's wonderful. And you're understandably wondering if it’s possible at your ages, and if it’s safe. That’s a very reasonable thing to consider. Just to clarify, you said “we.” Are you and your wife both actively trying to conceive, or is this more of a discussion at this point?
PATIENT: Discussion mostly. We not… try hard yet. We want to talk first. See what you think. My wife, she strong woman, but… I am old. Maybe body not so strong anymore. She worry about… problems. I worry too. We have Medicare, is that good here?
DOCTOR: That’s very smart of both of you to come in and talk things through before starting anything. It's good to be prepared and understand what to expect. And yes, Medicare is accepted here at the clinic. Okay, so it sounds like you're both thinking about the possibility of having a baby and have some concerns about your ages and potential health considerations. Let's talk about both of those. To start, how old are you and your wife, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Hmm… I am… seventy. I think. Maybe sixty-nine? Time go fast, you know? My wife… she is sixty-five. Strong, but… sixty-five. We have good life, but never have baby. Always talk about it… maybe now? But… is okay? Is safe for her? I worry about her health most.
DOCTOR: Okay, seventy and sixty-five. Thank you for sharing that. It's definitely possible to consider pregnancy at those ages, but there are increased risks involved, particularly for your wife's health. We'll need to carefully evaluate those. To get a better understanding of her overall health, could you tell me a little bit about her medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmm. She go to doctor regular. She have… blood pressure. They give her pills for that. And sometimes… pain in her joints. Old age, you know? She walk a lot, still. Very strong. She had… I think a small operation on her tummy, long time ago. But not much else. She healthy mostly. I worry about the pills, though. Is those okay for baby?
DOCTOR: Okay, so she has a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, some joint pain, and a previous abdominal surgery. That’s helpful. And you’re right to be concerned about the blood pressure medication – some can affect a developing baby, so we'll definitely need to review that specifically. Do you happen to know the name of the medication she’s taking?
PATIENT: Hmm… name? No, I do not know the name. She has many bottles. White bottle, I think? Small letters. She go to Doctor Ramirez for the blood pressure. He is good doctor. Maybe you can ask him? I am not good with remembering things like names. My wife, she is the one who remembers. But… she is busy now. Preparing lunch.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can absolutely obtain her medication list from Doctor Ramirez’s office. It's very common to coordinate care that way. I'll send a quick request for those records now. In the meantime, let's talk a little bit about your own health. Do you have any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Me? Hmm. Not much. I have… a little bit of trouble sleeping. Sometimes. But I take some tea for that. And my back… aches a little. Old age, you know? I walk a lot too, make things. I had… a fall last year. Broke my wrist. But it healed good. No problems now. Mostly just… tired sometimes. I think good eating, that helps. I like fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some trouble sleeping, occasional back pain, a previous wrist fracture, and generally feeling tired. That's helpful to know. And good on you for staying active and eating well – that’s very important. Now, have either of you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, or have any concerns about those?
PATIENT: Sexually… what? Oh! STIs? No. Not me. Not my wife. We have been married long time. Very long time. We are careful. Always careful. We… not many partners. Only each other. That is important, you know? Trust. We trust each other. Is that good answer? I not understand much about… those things.
DOCTOR: That is a very good answer, Mr. Carlotta. And yes, a long-term, monogamous relationship significantly reduces the risk of STIs. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's talk about family history. Do either of you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… family? My mother… she had problems with her heart. Old age. She died when I was young. My father… strong man. Lived long time. He had… nothing much. My wife’s mother… she had sugar, I think. Diabetes. My wife’s father… he had trouble breathing. Old age, mostly. Lots of old age problems in our families. But nothing… serious, I think. Not like… catching something. Is that helpful? I not good with all the medical names.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. So, a history of heart disease on your side, and diabetes on your wife’s side. That gives us a good starting point. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyles. Do either of you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My wife, she says it bad for health. And I agree. Alcohol… sometimes. A small glass of wine with dinner. On weekends. Not much. Recreational… what? Drugs? No! Never! We are good people. We don't do those things. We like to walk, make things, visit our friends. That is our recreation. Is that okay? I not understand why you ask. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay, Mr. Carlotta. I apologize if that question felt intrusive. I’m simply gathering information to understand your overall health and assess any potential risks. It’s good to hear that you both prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Yes. Okay. Is good. I not afraid. But… will it hurt? I have old bones, you know? Maybe fragile. I think I need to sit down. Is there a chair? Just… a little worried. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem very nice.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, have a seat. And no, it shouldn’t hurt. It will be a fairly basic exam – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your overall health. I’ll be very gentle. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood pressure. Is good. My wife says I need to watch my salt. Old age, you know? Everything gets… slow. Will it take long? I have to pick up some fish later. For dinner. My wife likes fish very much. Fresh fish. Is very important.
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all. Just a few minutes. And yes, a healthy diet, including fresh fish, is very important. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not alarmingly high, but something we should monitor, especially if you are considering starting a family. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur. Again, not immediately concerning, but something we should keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to take your pulse and temperature.
PATIENT: Pulse… and temperature. Okay. Everything slow now, you know? I feel it in my bones. Is the murmur… bad? My wife will worry. She very sensitive. She always takes care of me. Is it from the fish? I eat a lot of fish. Maybe too much fish? I like the mackerel best. Very oily. Is good for the brain, she says. But is bad for the heart? I confused now.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Your temperature is 98.6, also normal. The murmur is very slight, Mr. Carlotta, and it’s not necessarily related to your fish intake. It could be a completely normal finding, or it could be due to some minor changes in your heart valves. We'd need to do further testing, like an echocardiogram, to get a clearer picture. It’s good that your wife is very sensitive and takes care of you. And yes, fish is very good for the brain! But it's best to eat a variety of healthy foods, not just one thing. We can talk about dietary recommendations later. Your abdomen feels soft and there's no tenderness. Now, I'd like to briefly check your reflexes. Just a quick tap on your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Reflexes… knees? Okay. I not good with knees anymore. They creak a lot. Old age, you know? But is okay. Do what you need to do. My wife says I need to exercise them more. But is hard. Everything hard now. Is the murmur… serious? Will I need… a doctor? A big doctor? My wife will be very worried. She likes everything peaceful. No big doctors. No hospitals. Is peaceful important.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Nothing to be concerned about. And I understand your concern about the murmur. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need to see a “big doctor” or go to the hospital. We can start with some non-invasive testing, like an echocardiogram, which is a painless ultrasound of your heart. That will give us more information and help us determine if any further action is needed. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, I’ve completed the physical exam. Now, based on our conversation and the exam findings, here’s what I recommend. First, we need to get her medication list from Doctor Ramirez. Second, I'd like to schedule an echocardiogram for you. And finally, we need to discuss the potential risks and benefits of trying to conceive at your ages. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable… yes. That sounds good. Get the list. Echo… thing. And talk. Talk about risks. My wife… she is strong. But… is big decision. Old age… everything different. Is it safe for her? That is most important. You think is safe for her? Is hard for old bodies. But we want… a little bit of love. Is that selfish? At our age? We have been good people. We deserve a little bit of love. But… is safe for her? You really think is safe?
DOCTOR: It's not selfish at all to want a little bit of love, Mr. Carlotta. And it's very brave of you and your wife to consider this. I understand your concerns about her safety, and that's absolutely the most important thing we need to address. Pregnancy at your ages does carry increased risks, such as gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, preterm labor, and miscarriage. However, with careful monitoring and management, it can be a safe and rewarding experience. We need to assess her overall health, including her blood pressure control, any existing medical conditions, and her general fitness level. We'll also need to discuss the potential complications and make sure she understands the risks involved. I can’t give you a definitive answer about whether it’s safe right now. But I can assure you that we’ll do everything possible to ensure her health and well-being. Let’s start by getting her medication list and scheduling the echocardiogram for you. Then, we can schedule a follow-up appointment for both of you to discuss everything in more detail. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… good. List. Echo thing. Talk. Together. That is best. My wife… she needs to hear it too. Not just me. She strong, but… she worry. We worry together. Thank you, Doctor. You seem very… careful. And you listen. That is good. Many doctors… they rush. They don't listen. You listen. That is important. Okay. List first. How do we get the list? Do you call? I not good with phone. I get confused. My wife… she does the phone. But she is busy now. Preparing the dinner. Fish. She makes very good fish.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m glad I could reassure you. And you are absolutely right – it’s important for both of you to be involved in this process and feel comfortable with the decision. I’ll write down the number for Doctor Ramirez’s office. You can give it to your wife when she has a moment. They will need your wife’s date of birth and insurance information to release the records. They can fax it directly to the clinic, or she can request a copy for you to bring in. Here you go. And don’t worry about getting confused – that’s perfectly normal. Just take things one step at a time. We’ll schedule the echocardiogram for you next. Is there a particular day or time that works best for you?
PATIENT: Thank you. Numbers… good. She can do the numbers. She always does the numbers. Echo… thing. Hmm. Monday… is good. Afternoon. After lunch. She makes very good lunch. Fish. Maybe… Tuesday. Tuesday is good too. I not sure. Whatever is easy for you. I am flexible. Mostly. Old bones… they not so flexible. But I am flexible. Mostly. What day is best for you, Doctor? You choose. You are the doctor. You know. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Monday afternoon works perfectly. Let’s schedule that for you. It’s a non-invasive procedure, so you don’t need to worry about any special preparations. Just arrive about 15 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. Okay, Monday afternoon at 2:00 PM. I’ve made a note in your chart. Now, to summarize, we'll get your wife's medication list from Doctor Ramirez, you have an echocardiogram scheduled for Monday afternoon, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for both of you to discuss everything in more detail. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… good. List. Echo. Talk. Together. That is good. Very good. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. And you listen. That is important. My wife… she will be very happy. She worries a lot. But she strong. Very strong. I think… I think that is all. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything else you need from me? I not want to forget anything. Old age, you know. The memory… it goes.
DOCTOR: No, I think that’s everything for today, Mr. Carlotta. Just relax and let your wife take care of the medication list. And don't worry about forgetting things – that's perfectly normal. We'll be here to guide you through this process. Here’s a brochure with some general information about pregnancy risks and healthy eating. It might be helpful for both of you to read. If anything comes up before your appointment, or if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Carlotta. And I look forward to seeing you both on Monday. Have a good day, and enjoy your dinner. Especially the fish!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. You have a good day. And… thank you for listening. That is very important. Fish… yes. She makes very good fish.
