DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to really bother me.
DOCTOR: “A bit now,” is rather vague, Mr. Dhanoa. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry. Right. Um… maybe, like, three or four weeks now? It started quiet, just a little whistle, but it’s gotten louder. Especially at night when it’s quiet, you know? It makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: And is this ringing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yeah. But it feels like it's happening more than it used to. Some days it's barely noticeable, other days… well, today it’s pretty bad. It’s like a high-pitched ring, mostly. Sometimes a buzzing, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Buzzing and ringing…” Yes, Mr. Dhanoa, it certainly sounds like tinnitus. Now, have you been exposed to any loud noises recently?
PATIENT: Loud noises… hmm. Not really, I don't think. I work at a restaurant, so there's chatter and music, but nothing too loud. Nothing I haven't been around before, anyway. Not like a construction site or anything. I did go to a wedding last month, the band was pretty loud, but that was only for a few hours.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I usually try and avoid taking pills if I can, to be honest. Just a bit of paracetamol now and then for a headache, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of ear infections, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Not that I remember, no. When I was a little kid maybe, but nothing serious. Just the usual earaches when you’re a kid. I haven’t had one since I was, like, ten or something. My mum always said I was a bit prone to them, but it was ages ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a quick look in your ears, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Please sit forward slightly, Mr. Dhanoa. And try to remain still. Hmm. Your ear canals appear clear. There's no sign of any wax buildup or infection. The tympanic membranes look normal as well. Now, let's check your hearing.
PATIENT: Alright, good to hear they look okay, anyway. I'm ready for the hearing test, Doctor. Hopefully, it’ll show us what’s going on. I just want this ringing to stop, honestly. It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: We'll see what the test reveals, Mr. Dhanoa. Please put on these headphones. I’m going to play a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. Indicate when you hear a tone by pressing this button. It’s quite straightforward. Well… your hearing is within normal limits for your age. This makes the tinnitus rather… puzzling.
PATIENT: Puzzling? What does that mean, Doctor? Is something seriously wrong? I’m starting to get a bit worried now. I thought tests were supposed to find things, not just say everything’s normal when I’m clearly having a problem!
DOCTOR: Mr. Dhanoa, let me assure you, “puzzling” doesn’t equate to “serious”. Sometimes, tinnitus is idiopathic. Meaning, we simply don’t know the cause. It can be related to stress, anxiety… even minor vascular changes. We can try some management techniques, but a definitive cure… is unlikely. Have you been under any particular stress recently?
PATIENT: Stress… yeah, actually. My divorce was finalised a couple of months ago. It’s been… rough, to say the least. Trying to adjust to being on my own again, sorting out all the paperwork, you know? It’s a lot. I haven’t really been sleeping well either, thinking about everything. Could that be something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Dhanoa, that certainly fits the picture. Stress and sleep deprivation are common triggers for tinnitus. We can discuss some strategies for managing your stress and improving your sleep hygiene. I'm going to recommend a course of relaxation exercises and potentially a referral to a counsellor. It's unlikely to be a sudden fix, but it’s a reasonable starting point. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all, Doctor. Relaxation exercises and talking to someone sounds… good, actually. Better than just being told there’s nothing to be done. Will the exercises be something I do at home? And… how long would I need to see the counsellor for? Just trying to get a bit of an idea of what I’m letting myself in for. I'm a bit worried about the cost too, to be honest.
DOCTOR: The relaxation exercises are readily available online and via various apps, Mr. Dhanoa. You’ll need to commit to consistent practice, ideally 15-20 minutes daily. As for the counsellor, that depends on your individual needs. Typically, a course of six to eight sessions is a good starting point, though some patients benefit from longer-term therapy. Your insurance may cover a portion of the costs; you'll need to verify your coverage with them. I will write a referral for you now. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Right, okay. Six to eight sessions. And check the insurance… got it. No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time, even if we didn’t find a… a clear answer. I'll try the exercises and look into the counselling. Thanks again. I guess I'll be seeing myself out then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Dhanoa. Remember, consistency is key. And don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if your symptoms worsen or you have any further concerns. Take care. .
PATIENT: .
