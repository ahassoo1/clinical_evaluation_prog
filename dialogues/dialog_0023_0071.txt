DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s Karry Skarbek, yes. Well, it’s about some paperwork… for a friend. He’s… applying for a visa, to come visit. And I believe he needs to show proof of certain shots, vaccinations, before it can be approved. I'm helping him sort things out, and I wasn't sure where to start.
DOCTOR: A visa application… requiring vaccination records. I see. So, you're not experiencing any medical issues yourself, you’re assisting a friend with his paperwork. To clarify, you don't have any health concerns you’d like me to address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no concerns for me, thank you. I'm perfectly alright. Just trying to help my friend get everything in order. He’s a bit overwhelmed with all the forms and requirements, and I offered to look into the health side of things. It's mostly just understanding what shots he needs to show, you see?
DOCTOR: Very well. While I am a physician, and my time is allocated for patient care, I can certainly review his vaccination requirements, provided you have access to his records. Do you happen to have any documentation with you regarding his previous immunizations?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, Doctor. It took some doing, but I managed to get a hold of some old records from his doctor back home. They’re… not very organized, I’m afraid. Mostly copies of things. And some were handwritten… I hope they’re legible enough. Here.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, this is rather… fragmented. Dates are inconsistent, and some of the handwriting is difficult to decipher. Do you know what country your friend is applying to visit?
PATIENT: He’s applying to visit Canada, Doctor. He has family there he hasn’t seen in a long time. He was born there, actually, but he's lived here for… well, a long time now. I think knowing he was born there might matter, but I'm not certain. I just want to be sure we get everything right, so he won't be denied entry.
DOCTOR: Canada, you say. Being born there does simplify things, but it doesn’t negate the need for proof of certain vaccinations, depending on his age and previous immunization history. Let me pull up the current guidelines from the Canadian government… Do you know if he's had a Tetanus booster in the last ten years?
PATIENT: A tetanus booster… hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. I don’t recall him mentioning that specifically. He had all his childhood shots, of course, but… ten years… I honestly don’t know. He isn’t very good at remembering dates, that boy. Would a doctor's note saying he should be up-to-date be enough, or does it have to be a confirmed record?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, a "should be up-to-date" note is unlikely to be sufficient. Canada is fairly strict about verifying immunization status. We would need to either find documented proof of a recent booster, or administer one now. Given his uncertain history, and to avoid potential issues at the border, I would recommend a booster. It's a simple injection, and it will provide peace of mind. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. If it avoids problems, then yes, that's probably the best course of action. He wouldn't want to be turned away after traveling all that way. A simple injection… alright. What would that involve? And is there any cost associated with it? My insurance should cover most things, I believe.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The Tetanus booster is typically administered in the deltoid muscle – the upper arm. There’s a small risk of soreness at the injection site, and rarely, a mild systemic reaction like a low-grade fever. As for cost… Let me verify your insurance coverage… Yes, it appears your insurance will cover the booster with a standard co-pay. We'll also need to document his current health status, just for standard medical records. Do you mind if I take his blood pressure and a brief medical history while we’re at it?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Yes, of course, you may take his blood pressure and a brief history. Whatever you need to do to make sure everything is proper. He’ll be glad you’re being so thorough. I appreciate your help with this, truly. It’s a weight off my mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have him sit on the examination table. And, just so I have a clear understanding, you are assisting your friend with his visa application, and you are not experiencing any personal health issues today?
PATIENT: That’s correct, Doctor. No issues for me, thank you. Just helping my friend get his paperwork sorted. He's right here, ready to assist when needed. He's a little nervous, as you can imagine, but he’s quite strong.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please, have a seat. And, Mr. Skarbek, before we proceed, could you verify your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: .
