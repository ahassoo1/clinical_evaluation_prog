DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so… it’s my bruising. It’s been getting worse, and I’m on… that blood thinner stuff, you know, to prevent clots. It just seems like any little bump now turns into a huge purple mess. It’s kinda scary, honestly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Courtnye. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. It's good you mention the blood thinner – that's very important information. To clarify, when did you first notice this increased bruising becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? No, a little more than a month. Around the beginning of July, I think. I bumped my arm on the kitchen counter – usually just a little red mark, but this time it swelled up and turned black and blue. Then it just kept happening, even with tiny little knocks. I don’t remember doing anything different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately the beginning of July. And it seems to be happening with even minor trauma now, more easily than before. Have you noticed any bruising in specific areas, or is it fairly random across your body?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on my arms and legs, I think. My legs get it easier, probably because I keep knocking them on things, to be honest. I work from home, so I’m kinda always bumping into furniture. It’s not everywhere, but definitely more noticeable on those parts. And it lasts longer, too. Usually a bruise fades in a week, but these are hanging around for like two weeks now, even.
DOCTOR: I see. Arms and legs predominantly, lasting longer than usual – around two weeks now. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… tired, maybe? But I’m always tired, to be honest. It’s probably just work. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, no weird aches or pains. Honestly, just the bruises and feeling a bit more worn out than usual. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no bleeding elsewhere, no unusual pain. And the fatigue could be related to many things, so we’ll keep that in mind. Now, could you tell me a little bit about the blood thinner you are taking?
PATIENT: Um… let me see if I remember the name… It’s… Warfarin. Yeah, Warfarin. The doctor prescribed it after I had a… a blood clot in my leg a couple years back. It was scary. I have to get my blood tested regularly to make sure the dose is right, and… that’s about all I know, really. I just take the pills every day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very helpful. Warfarin is important to manage, and regular blood tests are crucial. Do you know what your most recent INR result was?
PATIENT: INR… oh gosh. Honestly, no. They just tell me if it’s okay to keep taking the same dose. I don’t really pay attention to the numbers. I just… trust that the lab techs and the doctor have it under control. Is that bad? I’m not very good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No, that's not bad at all, Courtnye. It’s perfectly alright to trust your healthcare team. However, knowing the INR can be helpful in situations like this. We can certainly look it up in your records here at the clinic. While I’m doing that, could you tell me about any other medications you’re taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Let's see… I take a multivitamin, just the basic one. And sometimes, when my back flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind you get at the pharmacy. That's about it, really. I try to avoid taking anything else if I can. I don’t want to mess with the Warfarin, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Okay, looking at your records here… your last INR was checked on July 15th, and it was 2.8. That is a bit on the higher side of the therapeutic range. Ideally, we want it between 2.0 and 3.0. A slightly elevated INR could certainly contribute to increased bruising. Are you experiencing any other symptoms that might suggest bleeding, such as blood in your stool or urine, or unusually heavy periods?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Everything else seems normal. Just the bruises, like I said. It's just… worrying, you know? I don't want to end up back in the hospital with another clot. That was terrifying. So, is the number being high the reason for the bruising? Is that all it is? Can you just… lower the dose or something? I need to get back to work, honestly. It's kinda hectic right now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Courtnye, and wanting to get back to work is very reasonable. It’s good you remember the experience with the clot – we always want to be cautious. Your INR being slightly elevated could be contributing to the increased bruising. However, it’s not always the sole cause. We also need to rule out other possibilities. To be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check for any other signs of bleeding or underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a meeting at 2:00. Just… a quick one, please. I don’t want anything complicated. You know, poking and prodding and sending me for a million tests. Just tell me if it's the Warfarin and if you can adjust the dose. That's all I really care about.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I completely understand wanting to keep things straightforward. We'll keep it concise. I’m not noticing any active bleeding or significant swelling at this moment. Your gums look healthy as well. I’ll also quickly listen to your heart and lungs, just as a standard part of the exam. Everything sounds clear. Based on this brief exam, it does seem likely that the slightly elevated INR is contributing to your increased bruising. It's good we have your recent results. We can adjust your Warfarin dosage downward slightly. I'm thinking we'll reduce it from [Current dosage - obtain from EHR] to [New dosage - calculated based on INR] milligrams daily. We'll need to recheck your INR in one week to ensure the new dosage is effective. Are you able to schedule a follow-up appointment then?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better. Less poking is good. Yeah, a week is fine. As long as it's not first thing in the morning. I have things to do. And… will the bruising stop if we lower the dose? Is that what happens? I just don’t want to keep looking like I've been in a fight. It's kinda embarrassing, to be honest. Just tell me it'll go away.
DOCTOR: It’s reasonable to be concerned about that, Courtnye. Lowering the dosage should help reduce the bruising. It may not disappear overnight, but it should gradually improve over the next week or two. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause trauma or injury, and applying ice to any areas where you do experience bruising. To reiterate, we’re reducing your Warfarin dosage to [New dosage] milligrams daily. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one week for a repeat INR check. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… try to keep it quick next time, okay? I appreciate you not sending me for a million tests. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Courtnye. My goal is always to provide efficient and effective care. We’ll keep the follow-up appointment concise. Thank you for coming in today. If you experience any unusual bleeding or worsening symptoms between now and your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
