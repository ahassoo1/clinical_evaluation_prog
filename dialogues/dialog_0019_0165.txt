DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Brege. Welcome. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, thanks for havin’ me. It’s this fever, see? Keeps comin’ back. It ain’t nothin’ major, usually, just…annoyin’. Been goin’ on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever, you say. That is annoying. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts outta nowhere, kinda like a chill, y’know? Then I get warm, real warm. Not like burnin’ warm, just…hot. Usually lasts a day, maybe two. Then it's gone for a week, two weeks...then BAM, it's back. Happens mostly at night, I think. It’s hard to say exactly, bein' retired and all, sleepin’ in whenever.
DOCTOR: Right, so it comes and goes, and seems to be worse at night. That’s helpful. And you said it’s been going on for a “bit now”… could you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I reckon, back in… March, maybe April? So, four, five months now? Somethin' like that. It wasn’t constant, just… started happenin' now and then. I figured it was somethin' I ate, honestly. Didn’t think much of it ‘til it kept comin’ back.
DOCTOR: Okay, four or five months of on-and-off fever. And you haven’t noticed anything specific that triggers it, like a certain food?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I eat… pretty much everything. My wife does most of the cookin’, bless her heart, and she makes good stuff. I haven't noticed it bein' worse after a certain meal or anything like that. It just… happens. Sometimes after bein’ out in the sun, maybe? But I'm retired, I spend plenty of time in the sun, so… I dunno. It don't seem to matter much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you have the fever, do you experience any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I get kinda tired. Real tired. And achy, like I pulled somethin’ even when I haven't. Mostly my back, funny enough, seein’ as I’m a chiropractor. Not like a bad pull, just… a dull ache. And sometimes a little headache. Not a killer headache, but enough to know somethin’s up. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin' like that. Just the fever, tiredness, and ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fever, fatigue, muscle aches—primarily in your back—and a mild headache when the fever is present. No respiratory symptoms. Have you checked your temperature at all when you're feeling feverish?
PATIENT: Yeah, my wife has. She worries. Usually around 101, 102. Not too bad, but enough to feel it. She keeps sayin’ I should come see someone, and I finally figured alright, alright. A chiropractor fixin’ backs is one thing, but a fever that keeps comin’ back… that’s somethin’ else. I don't wanna mess around with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, 101 to 102. Good on your wife for encouraging you to come in. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual old age stuff, y’know? High blood pressure, doc said, years ago. Keep it under control with some pills, nothin’ fancy. And my knees ain’t what they used to be, but who’s knees are, right? Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for an old timer. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee trouble. No other significant medical history or surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the one pill for the blood pressure, like I said. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Been takin’ it for… oh, must be ten years now? And that's it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothin'. I ain’t one for all that fancy stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for your blood pressure. And you haven't had any allergies to medications or anything else that you know of?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of, anyways. Never had a reaction to anythin’. My wife always asks when she gets me somethin’ over the counter, and I always tell her no. Never had any problems. I guess I’m a pretty simple guy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nah, not anymore. Quit smokin' about thirty years ago. Best thing I ever did. And I don't drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, on a special occasion. But that’s it. I ain’t much of a drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, former smoker, occasional glass of wine. Now, about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had…diabetes, I think. And my mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my brother… he had heart trouble, years ago. Other than that, I don’t really know. We weren’t a family that talked much about health stuff, to be honest. Mostly just took things as they came. But yeah, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart trouble, on my side.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes, hypertension and heart trouble in your family. Let me do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your temperature, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It'll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead, doc. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just get this fever figured out, that’s all I ask. Been disruptin’ my naps, y’know?
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is currently 99.2. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. I'm noticing a slight enlargement of your spleen, but it's subtle. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Blood pressure is 138/82. Anything else I should know?
PATIENT: Enlarged…spleen? That don't sound good, doc. I ain't ever heard of that before. No, that's it, I think. Just this fever, and now an enlarged...spleen. What does that mean, doc? Is it serious? And is it from the fever or somethin' else? I'm startin’ to get worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brege, it's understandable to be concerned. An enlarged spleen, also called splenomegaly, can have several causes. It's not necessarily serious, but it does warrant further investigation. It could be related to the fever, as some infections can cause temporary spleen enlargement. However, it can also be caused by other things, like liver disease, blood disorders, or certain types of cancer, although those are less likely given your history. I want to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll check your complete blood count, liver function tests, and look for any signs of infection. I'm also going to order a monospot test, just to rule out mononucleosis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… monospot… all sounds complicated, doc. Alright, alright. If you think it’s best, do it. I just wanna feel normal again, you know? Tired of bein’ achy and feverish, and now this enlarged…spleen thing. So, what happens now? Do I gotta go somewhere special, or can I get it done here? And how long will it take to get the results? I got a bridge game Friday I don’t wanna miss.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brege. The lab is right down the hall. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood, and it shouldn’t take long – maybe 15-20 minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours, so we should have them by Thursday at the latest. In the meantime, I recommend you get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid strenuous activity until we know what’s causing your symptoms, just to be safe. And if your fever gets significantly higher – over 103 – or you develop any new symptoms, like severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or bleeding, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll call you as soon as the results are back to discuss them and figure out the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, doc. Rest, fluids, and don’t play bridge if I get too hot. Got it. And call me as soon as you know somethin'. I appreciate you lookin' into this, really. This enlarged spleen thing has me a little spooked, to be honest. Okay, well, I guess I’ll go get this blood work done. Thank you, Dr. Renzi. I’ll be waitin’ for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brege. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. And try not to worry too much – we’ll figure this out. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
