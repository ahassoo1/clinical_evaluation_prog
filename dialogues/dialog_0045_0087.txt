DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Right. Just… the lab work. Doctor said I needed some, you know. Yearly thing, I think. Honestly, it all blurs together after a while. Just want to get it done, if we could. Don’t really remember what they’re looking for, exactly.
DOCTOR: Right. Yearly labs. Understandable, things do get lost in the shuffle. Let's pull up Dr. Ramirez’s notes here… Okay. It looks like he ordered a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Standard stuff for someone your age, keeps an eye on things. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions while we wait for the results to come through. Just to get a fuller picture, you know?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a lot of words. Look, I’m not really good with remembering all that. Just… whatever the doctor ordered is fine. As long as it’s quick, that’s all I ask. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, those tests are fairly standard, Mr. Croonquist. And yes, we want to be quick. But having a little more information helps me make sure everything is okay. Let’s start simple. Have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different… how? I mean, I wake up, I go to bed. Some days are warmer than others, some colder. I eat… sometimes. Honestly, not much changes around here. I’m… mostly just here. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Okay. “Mostly just here.” Right. Let’s try this a different way. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy… Hmm. No, not really. I get tired, sure. But I always get tired. Always have. It’s… hard to say if it’s different. I don't go doing much that requires energy, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any trouble with your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… No, not really. Eat when I feel like it. Sometimes I don't. Not much excitement in cooking for one, you know? Mostly just… soup, or something simple. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… now that’s a question. Look, Doctor, I really don’t like talking about things like that. Is it necessary? Can't we just do the blood work? I'm not feeling well, but it's not… that kind of unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We can skip that for now. It's just part of the routine, trying to be thorough. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling… No, I don't think so. I wear boots most of the time, so… it’s hard to tell, maybe? They’re pretty tight. It’s just… winter is coming, and my feet always feel a bit… puffy. But I don’t think it’s swelling, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal… pal-what now? Look, I get a little winded walking up hills, but that's about it. I'm an old man! Chest is fine, as far as I know. Never had any pain. My heart... beats, I guess. Still going, hasn't given out yet.
DOCTOR: Right. Alright. Look, Mr. Croonquist, I'm trying to get a complete picture of your health. These questions are important, even if you don't think they apply to you. Let's try this: Have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Falls… Hmm. Not recently, no. Not a bad one. I stumbled a bit last spring, tripped over a root in the garden. But I didn’t fall fall, if you know what I mean. Just… went down a bit, caught myself. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. “Tripped, caught yourself.” Right. And do you have any difficulty with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Well, things aren't as sharp as they used to be, that's for sure. And sometimes sounds… get muffled. But who doesn't have trouble with their vision and hearing at my age? It’s just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. The lab results are back. Your complete blood count is within normal limits. Your basic metabolic panel is… a little off. Your creatinine is slightly elevated. Your lipid panel is… less than ideal. And your thyroid levels are normal.
PATIENT: Cre-what now? And… less than what? Look, Doctor, I don't understand any of this. Just… is it bad? Am I sick? Can we just give me something for it, whatever “it” is, and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s try to break this down. “Creatinine” is a waste product in your blood, and yours is a bit high, which suggests your kidneys aren’t functioning at 100%. It's not an emergency, but we need to monitor it. Your cholesterol is high, which increases your risk of heart disease. I'm going to prescribe you a statin to lower your cholesterol. And I want you to follow up with a nephrologist to get your kidneys checked.
PATIENT: A… a what now? A statin? And another doctor? Look, I barely remember my own name some days, you expect me to keep track of all this? And what about my kidneys? Are they broken? Just… can’t I just take a pill for everything? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Croonquist, I understand this is a lot to take in. But “nephrologist” is a kidney specialist, and we need to make sure everything is okay with your kidneys. The statin will help lower your cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Elkins, a nephrologist in town. And I’ll prescribe the statin. It’s important you take it as directed. Do you have any questions specifically about the medication or the referral?
PATIENT: …Will it make me tired? Everything makes me tired. And… will I have to come back here often? I just… I really don't want to keep coming back.
DOCTOR: The statin can cause some fatigue in some patients, yes. But usually it's mild and goes away after a few weeks. As for coming back, you'll need to see Dr. Elkins for a consultation, and then likely follow up with regular blood tests to monitor your kidney function. I'll have the nurse schedule those appointments for you before you leave. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No… not that I remember. I used to get hay fever as a boy, but that was a long time ago. I think. Honestly, Doctor, I've been taking pills for so long, I've lost track. Just… as long as it doesn't make me feel worse, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s your referral to Dr. Elkins, and a list of the medications I'm prescribing, along with instructions. The nurse will schedule those follow-up appointments for you. I recommend you also try to stay hydrated, and eat a balanced diet. I'll have the nurse print out some resources on kidney-friendly diets for you. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: …Will it hurt? The tests, the appointments… will any of it hurt? I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: The tests are fairly routine, Mr. Croonquist. The blood tests will involve a simple needle prick. Dr. Elkins may want to do some imaging scans, which don't usually cause any pain, just some mild discomfort from lying still. The nurse will explain everything in detail before each appointment. Look, I understand you're anxious. But these tests are important for your health. Now, I really need to see other patients. Do you have any specific questions about the medication or the referral that I haven't answered?
PATIENT: …No. I think… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. Have a good day, Mr. Croonquist. Some people just make it so difficult…
PATIENT: .
