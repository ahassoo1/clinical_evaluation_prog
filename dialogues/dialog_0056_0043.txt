DOCTOR: Hi Percell, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Amussen, nice to meet you too. It’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, kinda feels like a tight band. It's been botherin' me for a little while now, nothin' terrible, but it just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache that feels like a tight band at the back of your head. And you said it’s been going on for a little while… can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started… oh, maybe three, four weeks ago now? It comes and goes, mostly just a dull ache. Not like a pounding thing, you know? It’s just… there. I can usually ignore it, but sometimes it’s enough to make me feel kinda tired, makes it hard to concentrate on my work. I'm a financial advisor, so gotta keep my head clear!
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache, coming and going for about three or four weeks, and sometimes it makes you feel tired and affects your concentration. Okay. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no headache at all and ten being the worst headache you can imagine, what number would you give it when it's at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. It definitely doesn't get to a ten, not even close. Maybe a… four, five on a bad day? Like I said, it's not crippling. More annoying than anything. Sometimes I take some of those over-the-counter pain pills, the ones for headaches, and they help a bit. But I don’t want to just keep takin’ pills all the time, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a four or five at its worst, and over-the-counter pain relievers help some. Good to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse – certain activities, foods, stress, anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, I think stress does make it worse. My job can be pretty hectic, lots of numbers and deadlines. And sometimes, if I spend too long lookin' at the computer, it feels tighter. I’ve been tryin’ to take more breaks, but it’s hard when things are busy. I don't think food does anything, and I haven’t changed anything about my routine except tryin’ to relax more.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress and prolonged computer use seem to be triggers. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms along with the headache – like vision changes, nausea, fever, neck stiffness, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. No blurry vision, haven’t been sick to my stomach, no fever… my neck feels a little stiff sometimes, but I figured that’s just from sittin’ at my desk all day. I haven’t noticed anything else different, no. It really is just the headache. It's just… persistent. It’s annoyin’ because I usually don’t get headaches at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a better picture of your overall health, do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine then. Other than that… not really. I used to have high blood pressure, but that's been under control for a long time with some pills the doctor gave me. And I had a little surgery on my knee years ago, but it healed up fine. Nothing major, you know? I try to stay active, walk when I can, but I'm gettin' older, things don't bounce back like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure – currently controlled with medication – and a past knee surgery. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here it is. It’s Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams every day. I've been takin' it for… oh, must be ten years or more now. And I get it refilled regularly, so I haven't had to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything the doctors have given me before. I can eat anything, no food allergies, haven't had any problems with bee stings or anything like that. My wife used to be allergic to pollen, but… well, she’s gone now. But I didn't inherit that allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, can you tell me if anyone in your family has a history of headaches or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother used to get migraines, pretty bad ones, but she didn't go to the doctor much. And my brother… he had some trouble with his back when he was younger, but I don’t think it was neurological. Nobody else really had much trouble with headaches that I know of. My father was pretty healthy, actually, lived to be 88.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of migraines in your mother, but otherwise no significant family history. Alright, Percell, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. I'm going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam – check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Now I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear on both sides. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes – just look at it and don’t move your head. Okay, good. Now I'm going to test your reflexes… And finally, let’s just have you stand up and walk a few steps for me. Okay, everything seems pretty normal so far. Your neurological exam is within normal limits, reflexes are good, and your balance is steady. I don’t see anything here that’s immediately concerning. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tension headaches. These are very common, and often related to stress, muscle tension, and things like prolonged computer use, as you’ve noticed. However, because your headaches have been ongoing for several weeks, and you're over 80, I'd like to be a little more cautious and order a basic blood test to rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think it’s best to be safe, I agree. Blood test is fine with me. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it turns out to be nothing. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll write you an order for a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The lab is just down the hall – they'll draw some blood, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to try to manage your stress – things like regular exercise, relaxation techniques, and taking breaks from the computer. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen are fine to use as needed, but try not to rely on them long-term. I'll also give you a handout with some tips for managing tension headaches. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. That all sounds reasonable. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismiss it as an old man complainin'. I'll go down to the lab and get that blood work done. And I’ll try my best with the stress. Easier said than done sometimes, but I'll give it a shot. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. It’s my job to listen, and I take it seriously. I'll review the results as soon as they come back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Here's that handout. And if your headaches get significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, please don't hesitate to call the office right away. I’ll have the nurse print out the lab order for you, and she can also give you instructions on preparing for the test. Do you need a work note?
PATIENT: No, thank you, I don't need a work note. I can manage things at my office. I appreciate you thinkin' of it, though. I think I have everything I need for now. Again, thank you, Doctor. I feel much better just having talked it through and having a plan. I'll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I'm glad I could help. You take care now, and I’ll see you soon.
