DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let’s just get this over with. I need somethin’ signed, somethin’ about… well, somethin’ about gettin’ somethin’ done. A procedure. That’s what the lady on the phone said. I don’t rightly recall the details, to be honest. It's somethin' my niece was talkin’ about, she does all my paperwork now.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s see if we can pull up what your niece scheduled. Just one moment… Hmm. It appears… there’s a request for a pre-authorization for a colonoscopy. Is that what you were referring to?
PATIENT: A… colo-what-now? Listen, Doctor, I ain't much for fancy words. My niece said somethin' about lookin’ inside… down there. She said it was cosmetic, but I got a feelin’ she mixed somethin' up. I just want to get this signed so I can be on my way. Is that somethin' you do, sign papers? Don’t need no lookin’ inside nothin’. I'm a perfectly healthy man, mostly.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic?
PATIENT: That's what she said, Doctor. Bless her heart, she means well, but she gets things confused. She keeps tellin’ me I need to “improve my appearance.” I told her, I look just fine for 64! But she said this… this “colo-thing” would help. Said it was a new procedure. Frankly, it sounds like nonsense. I just want somethin' signed so I don't have to deal with her about it anymore. Is it possible to just sign the paper without… the lookin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, a colonoscopy isn’t a cosmetic procedure. It’s a screening test for colon cancer. It's very important, especially as you get older. Now, I understand you're not remembering the details, and that's alright. But simply signing a form without understanding what it’s for… I can’t do that ethically. It’s… it’s a bit more involved than that. Before I sign anything, I need to understand why your niece scheduled this. Do you have any family history of colon cancer?
PATIENT: Colon… can-sir? Look, I don't mess with family history much. Folks don't talk about that kind of thing. My mother, she passed a long time ago. And my… well, let's just say there weren't any happy family dinners. She didn't talk about nothin'. Honestly, Doctor, I think your niece is makin' a big fuss over nothin’. I eat pretty regular. Mostly fried chicken, but still. I feel fine. Can't you just ask her? She's the one who knows all these details! I just came here to get this over with, not have a… a life story lesson.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no known family history then. And you’re feeling well, no changes in your bowel habits, no blood in your stool, no abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Well now that you mention it… sometimes, after the chicken, things are a bit… irregular. But that's just the chicken, Doctor! Good chicken does that to a man. And no blood. Definitely no blood. I would know if there was blood! I ain’t blind. Look, I’m a simple man. I fix towers. I don’t go around lookin’ at… well, you know. Can we please just focus on gettin’ this paper signed? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: “Irregular” bowel habits… and you’ve noticed this after eating fried chicken?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. After the chicken. It’s common sense, Doctor. Grease does things to your insides. You ever eaten a good piece of fried chicken? It's… it's a digestive event. Sheesh. This is gettin’ ridiculous. I came here for a signature, not a lecture on poultry! Is this somethin’ you can do or not? I'm wastin’ my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re frustrated. But changes in bowel habits, even if they seem related to something like fried chicken, are something we need to take seriously. It could be something simple, but it could be something more. I’m not comfortable signing this pre-authorization form without a proper examination. I want to listen to your abdomen, and I think it would be best to do a simple stool test, just to rule things out. It's a quick procedure. Would you be willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: A… stool test?! Look, Doctor, I ain't givin’ you no samples! This is preposterous! I came here for a piece of paper, and now you want to poke and prod and… and analyze my waste? Absolutely not! I'm a grown man, I know my body. A little chicken never hurt anyone! I’m leaving. You’re wastin' my time, and frankly, you’re makin’ me uncomfortable. I’ll just… I’ll just find another doctor. One who understands that a signature is just a signature. .
