DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for this, but… well, I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be… easy, you know? My husband… he passed, and I don’t want any complications. I'm not getting any younger, and frankly, I just want a straightforward answer about making sure everything works without a whole lot of fuss. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a smooth process, Ms. Villarreal, and I assure you we will proceed as efficiently as possible. It is certainly admirable you are considering this, and I want to assure you, we will do everything we can to ensure a healthy pregnancy. However, “easy” is not always a realistic expectation when it comes to conception, even under ideal circumstances. To begin, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… honestly? It’s a blur. I mean, I went to the doctor when I had to, you know, regular check-ups, things like that. Nothing major. I was pretty healthy, I think. My husband always said so. I don't really remember specifics. Maybe some colds, the usual stuff. Look, is this really necessary? I just want to know if I can get pregnant, not recite my entire life story.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your desire for brevity, Ms. Villarreal, a comprehensive understanding of your medical background is essential. It's not merely about reciting your life story, but about identifying potential factors that could impact your fertility or the health of a future pregnancy. For instance, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay, fine. Let me think… Diabetes? No. High blood pressure… maybe? My mother had that, so… possibly? I don't feel like I have it. Thyroid… honestly, doctor, I have no idea what that even is. I ate pretty healthy, did some walking, that’s about it. My husband took care of most of that stuff when he was around. I really don't remember any specific diagnoses. Can we just… skip all this and do a test or something?
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration, but proceeding without a proper assessment would be irresponsible. Your mother's history of hypertension is relevant, and, while you may not feel symptomatic, high blood pressure often presents without noticeable signs. We need to establish a baseline for your current health status. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it, I think. And I was in the hospital when I gave birth, obviously. But other than that… no. Nothing major. Really. Is this going to take all day? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I assure you, I am attempting to be as efficient as possible. Knowing about your appendectomy is helpful, thank you. And yes, childbirth is a significant medical event. Now, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay, let me think... I take a multivitamin, sometimes. Just the basic one, you know, for women. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for allergies. Just when it’s really bad, though. It's one of those… Zyrtec or something. I honestly can’t remember the name. My husband always handled the pharmacy stuff. Look, is this really important? I'm a pretty healthy person! Can we just get to the bottom of whether I can have a baby or not?
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, while you may perceive yourself as healthy, even seemingly innocuous medications and supplements can potentially impact fertility or pregnancy. It’s my responsibility to investigate all possible factors. Very well. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history... Okay, well, my mother had that blood pressure thing, like I said. And my grandmother… she had some kind of arthritis, I think. Really painful, she was always complaining. My father’s side… honestly, I didn’t know him very well. He died when I was young. I don’t really know much about his family’s medical history. Can we please just get this over with? I'm starting to feel a headache coming on.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your impatience, but this information is crucial. Knowing about your mother’s hypertension and your grandmother’s arthritis is helpful. We'll need to document it. Now, and this may be a sensitive question, have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally, a sensible question. Yes. I had… two. Both healthy boys, thank goodness. But… it was a long time ago. And… things were different then. I didn't have any major problems, but it wasn’t… easy, I guess. But I did have babies. So why are we even doing this? It's not like I've never been pregnant before! Can we just check if I’m still able to get pregnant, instead of asking me about my entire life?
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, the fact that you have had successful pregnancies in the past does provide valuable information. However, fertility can change over time due to a variety of factors, including age, hormonal shifts, and other medical conditions. Simply having had children previously does not guarantee a straightforward conception now. Given your history, and to proceed responsibly, I would like to perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam, to assess your overall health and reproductive organs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. A pelvic exam? Seriously? Look, I really don’t think that’s necessary. I just had babies! I’m sure everything is… fine. I don't like the sound of that at all. Can't we just do some blood work or something? Is there any way to avoid that? I'm starting to regret coming here. This is all very… invasive.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if this process feels invasive. However, a physical exam is a standard part of a fertility evaluation and allows me to assess your overall health and identify any potential issues that may be affecting your ability to conceive. Blood work alone will not provide a complete picture. Furthermore, to provide you with the best possible care, I need to perform a thorough assessment. If you are unwilling to allow me to conduct a physical exam, I am afraid I cannot proceed with this evaluation. I am happy to provide you with a referral to another physician if you prefer. I must prioritize your health and safety.
