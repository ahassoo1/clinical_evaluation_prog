DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ambris. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, honestly? It's my breath. It smells…bad. Like, really bad. I don't need a lecture on brushing, okay? I do brush. It just…is what it is. I figured you're the expert, so here I am. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Very well. While I appreciate your…directness, Ms. Ambris, a complete history is still necessary. "Smells bad" is a rather subjective assessment. Could you describe the odor?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Describe it? It smells…rotten, I guess? Like old food. Not, like, fishy, thankfully. Just…bad. Look, I'm divorced, I don't have time for a detailed smell report. Is that good enough? I work on the highway, it's not exactly a perfume factory out there.
DOCTOR: Highway work, you say. And how long has this… unpleasantness been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know, a while. Probably got worse after the divorce, to be honest. People just weren't…as nice about pointing things out before. A few months, at least. Longer? It's not like I'm keeping a calendar of bad breath days. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: A few months. Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No. Just the breath. I mean, I'm tired, but that's from, you know, work. And my ex is a nightmare, but that’s not a medical symptom. Look, are we getting closer to a solution or just collecting gossip?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, this is a medical consultation, not a confessional. We need to rule out underlying causes. Have you noticed any pain in your teeth or gums?
PATIENT: No pain. Absolutely none. My teeth are fine. I go to the dentist…when I have to. I'm not some delicate flower, doctor. I can handle a little discomfort. It’s just the smell, okay? A simple fix, I hope. I really don't have the patience for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a quick examination. Open please. And try to relax. It will be faster if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Gums are slightly inflamed, some tartar buildup. No obvious cavities. Tongue appears coated. Now, breathe out for me, please. Yes. The odor is…distinct. Have you had a tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: Tonsil-what now? No. Never had anything taken out of my throat. Look, I'm a highway worker, not a princess. I've broken a bone or two, that's about it. Is that important? Just tell me what's wrong with my breath, doctor. I don’t need a biology lesson.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, the tonsils can harbor bacteria. It seems you have a significant amount of bacterial overgrowth, likely contributing to the halitosis. It’s not uncommon. Now, this could be a simple case of poor oral hygiene, but given the persistence, we need to consider other factors. Do you experience postnasal drip?
PATIENT: Post…what? Look, sometimes my nose runs, okay? Especially when it's cold. I work outside, doctor. That happens. Is everything a medical term with you? Just...do you need me to blow my nose or something? I'm starting to think this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Postnasal drip, Ms. Ambris, is mucus draining down the back of your throat. It can contribute to bacterial growth. It is a common occurrence. Given your work environment, and the lack of any other significant findings, it’s likely a combination of factors. Poor oral hygiene, postnasal drip, and potentially, an accumulation of bacteria in the oral cavity. I’m going to recommend a thorough oral hygiene regimen. Twice-daily brushing, flossing, and a non-alcohol mouthwash. If this does not resolve the issue within two weeks, I suggest you consult a dentist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So, brush and floss. Groundbreaking. Look, I already told you I brush! But fine, I'll brush more. And floss. Whatever. Two weeks. If it’s still bad, I guess I’ll find a dentist who doesn’t ask me about my tonsils. Can I go now? I’ve got asphalt to lay. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is a list of recommended oral hygiene products. If the condition persists beyond two weeks, schedule an appointment with a dentist. And Ms. Ambris, I strongly advise you to maintain proper hydration. It is essential for overall health. Good day. .
