DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. I’m 51, and frankly, I’d like to… streamline things. I want a baby, and I want it to be easy. No complications. Is that so much to ask? I’ve heard good things about your… efficiency.
DOCTOR: "Efficiency" is… a curious way to put it, Ms. Shteynberg. While I appreciate directness, achieving a pregnancy, even at your age, isn't generally a matter of simply streamlining things. It's a complex physiological process. Before we discuss your expectations, I need a thorough medical history to assess your overall health and suitability for pregnancy. We need to determine if there are any underlying factors that could pose risks to you or the potential baby. Let’s start with the basics. Have you been trying to conceive for a long time?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not exactly. I haven't… been actively trying. I just… assumed it would happen. I’m in decent shape, I eat reasonably well, and I’ve never had any major illnesses. I just want to know if I need to… jump through hoops, or if my body still works. And quickly, please. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: “Assumed it would happen” isn’t a reliable method of family planning, Ms. Shteynberg. Fertility declines with age, and even in good health, there can be factors affecting your ability to conceive. To accurately assess your situation, I need more information. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Minor? Honestly, no. A bit of the flu here and there, like everyone. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was… decades ago. And a bad sprain in my ankle, but that healed perfectly. Really, that’s it. I'm very… robust. It’s just… frustrating to think I might need to be poked and prodded for this.
DOCTOR: “Robust” is… reassuring, to a point. But even a history of seemingly insignificant events can be relevant. You mentioned your tonsillectomy. Were there any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: Complications? No. None that I recall. They took them out, I was sick for a week, I ate a lot of ice cream, and that was the end of it. Look, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just cataloging my childhood? I need to know if this is viable, not my entire medical history from age five.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, a complete medical history is essential for determining if pregnancy is safe for you. It’s not about cataloging your childhood; it’s about identifying potential risks. Let’s move on then. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve avoided hospitals whenever humanly possible. I believe in… preventative maintenance. Good diet, exercise, and a strong constitution. That's it. Honestly, I find all these questions rather… insulting. I’m a healthy woman. Can we just… test something? See if everything's functioning as it should?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration, but I assure you, my questions are not intended to be insulting. They are standard medical procedure. However, if you are unwilling to provide a complete history, it will be difficult – impossible, actually – to provide you with accurate and safe medical advice. Before we proceed with any testing, I need to ask about your family medical history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Living? My mother passed away five years ago. Complications from… old age, mostly. My father… he’s… around. We don’t speak. Not anymore. And frankly, I have no idea what illnesses he had. He wasn't one for sharing. Are we still doing this? This is a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, according to your Medicare records, you had a cholesterol check six months ago and a flu shot last October. Is that correct?
