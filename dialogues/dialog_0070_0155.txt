DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that’s what they said I was here for. Honestly, I don't remember all the details. My daughter, she scheduled it. Something about my hand shaking? It’s been… a while, I guess. Not a big deal, really.
DOCTOR: I see. A tremor, brought on by concerns your daughter had. That's perfectly alright, it’s common for symptoms to develop gradually. And it’s good she’s looking out for you. To help me understand what’s been going on, could you tell me a little more about the shaking?
PATIENT: Shaking… well, it’s mostly in my right hand. It happens when I try to do things, you know? Like… holding a cup of coffee. Or… writing. Though I haven't written much lately. It’s not constant, thankfully. Sometimes it’s just… there. A little wobble. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. You're describing it very clearly. So, it primarily affects your right hand, occurs when you're actively using it – like with a cup or writing – and isn’t present all the time. It's more of an intermittent wobble when you’re trying to do something. Could you tell me roughly when you first noticed this shaking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a hard one. Seems like… a few months, maybe? Or longer? I really can’t say for sure. Everything feels a bit… blurred lately. It wasn’t sudden, that I remember. Just… gradually got worse, I suppose. My daughter noticed it before I did, I think. She has a good eye for these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset over a few months, noticed more by your daughter initially. That’s helpful. And you said it’s been worsening. Has it been affecting your ability to do everyday tasks?
PATIENT: Well… holding things is harder. Dropping things. I used to be quite handy around the house, fixing things… not so much anymore. I avoid things that need a steady hand, if I can. It's… frustrating, I suppose. I don't want to be a bother to anyone, so I just… do without.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be very frustrating, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like it's impacting your daily life and you’re understandably adjusting to avoid difficulties. Now, besides your hand, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Maybe a little… tired, sometimes? But I’m 79, Doctor! I’m supposed to be tired. My memory isn’t what it used to be, that's for sure. But I don’t think anything else… no pain, no dizziness, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Fatigue is common at any age, and especially as we get older. And the memory concerns are certainly something we can address as well. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of, or have you been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That’s a long time ago. I had… something with my blood pressure, a long time back. They gave me pills for it. Stopped taking them eventually. Don't really remember why. And… I think I had the flu a few times. Nothing serious, though. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is a mess. I wouldn’t rely on me for details.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. We can work with what you remember, and I can review any records we have available. It's common for details to fade over time. You mentioned blood pressure medication in the past. Do you know if you were ever diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I lived in Czechoslovakia for a long time, you know. Different doctors, different system. Things weren't always well-documented. It was a long time ago. I really don't think there was anything else. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Jezik. It gives me a better understanding of your history. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was young. That’s about it, I think. And maybe a tonsillectomy. That’s… a long time ago, though. I don’t think I’ve been hospitalized since. Nothing major, anyway. Just the usual sniffles and colds. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty simple man. Never caused much trouble for the doctors.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Jezik. So, appendix and tonsils as the only surgeries. And no recent hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I try to avoid pills if I can. I used to take something for… arthritis, maybe? But I stopped taking it a long time ago. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the way it made me feel. Now, I just… manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes with certain flowers, but nothing serious. No, sir, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m a pretty sturdy fellow, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had something with his heart, I think. Died when I was young. And my mother… she had arthritis, like me. A lot of aches and pains. As for other things… I don’t really know. We didn’t talk much about health back then. It wasn’t something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Alright, heart condition in your father and arthritis in your mother. That's helpful to know. Now, and this is just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh dear. Well, I'm retired, of course. Used to work at the water treatment plant, keeping things clean. Now, I mostly stay home. I enjoy reading, when my eyes allow. And… I watch television. Not much excitement, I'm afraid. I don't drink much anymore, and I never smoked.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Jezik. No smoking, limited alcohol. Now, can you tell me about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet… Well, I try to eat healthy. My daughter makes sure of that! She brings me groceries, and tells me what I should be eating. Lots of vegetables, some meat, and… I like soup. I don't really cook for myself much anymore. It's easier that way. I don't have a sweet tooth, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a sensible approach, Mr. Jezik. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I would like to ask one final question. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep patterns, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… well, I'm an old man, Doctor! My mood isn't always the best. And my sleep… it comes and goes. Sometimes I sleep fine, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. Energy levels… They're not what they used to be, that's for sure. But I don't think it's anything unusual for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for answering all those questions for me. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neurological function, including your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds… fine. I never was good with doctors. Just… get it over with quickly, if you would be so kind. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I'll do my best to be as quick and thorough as possible. Just relax your arm for me, please. … 140 over 85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take deep breaths in and out for me. … Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but I do hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination. Could you please extend your arms and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… don't poke me too hard.
DOCTOR: … Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, a little diminished. Now, I'm going to ask you to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger. … Now, let's try alternating touching your nose and my finger. … Alright, Mr. Jezik. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Done. Can I sit down now? This is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Take your time. Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the physical examination and your history, I’m noting mild tremor in your right hand, diminished reflexes, and slightly unsteady gait. I also heard some mild crackles in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid retention. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an X-ray? Oh, dear. I really didn’t want to go through all this… But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… try to make it quick, please. I don’t like being poked and prodded. When can I go home?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. We’ll get it done as quickly and efficiently as possible. I’ll write the orders for the blood work and chest X-ray now. The blood work will require a simple blood draw, and the chest X-ray is a quick imaging procedure. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the blood sample right away. The X-ray technician is available this afternoon. It should only take about 30 minutes for both procedures. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some possible causes for your symptoms. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, the most likely possibility is an essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, usually in the hands. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, such as thyroid problems or medication side effects, which is why I’m ordering the blood work. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Essential tremor… sounds… serious. Is it… going to get worse? Will I… lose the use of my hand? Oh dear. And medication… I don't take anything! So it can't be that, can it? This is all very confusing. And… tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It's natural to feel anxious when facing an uncertain diagnosis. Essential tremor is generally not life-threatening, and it doesn't typically cause any other health problems. While it can sometimes worsen over time, the rate of progression varies greatly from person to person. In many cases, it remains mild and doesn’t significantly interfere with daily activities. And even when it does progress, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms, such as medication, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery. You are right to point out you don't take any medication, which makes a medication-induced tremor less likely. But we still need to rule out other potential causes through the blood work. We’re not making any definitive diagnoses yet, Mr. Jezik. We're simply gathering information to understand what's going on. Once we have the results of the blood work and chest X-ray, we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?
PATIENT: Surgery… no, no surgery. I don't want any surgery. I… I just want to go home. And maybe have a cup of tea. Is that too much to ask? This whole thing is… upsetting.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Jezik. I assure you, we’re not pushing for any procedures at this stage. We’re simply exploring all possible options. Surgery is only considered in severe cases that don’t respond to other treatments. I’m happy to let you go home now. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood, and then you can schedule the chest X-ray at your convenience. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and call you with the findings. We can then discuss the best course of action based on the results. Here’s a slip with the order for your blood work. And here’s the contact information for the radiology department, where you can schedule your chest X-ray. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And yes, a cup of tea sounds lovely. I hope you have a peaceful afternoon. Is there anything else I can help you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I really appreciate your patience. It’s… hard, you know? Getting old. I think I'll just go home now. And have that tea.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It's completely understandable. And you've been a very patient patient. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a peaceful afternoon, and enjoy your tea. .
