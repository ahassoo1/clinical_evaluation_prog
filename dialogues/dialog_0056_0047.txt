DOCTOR: Hi Cleo, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doc. Good to meet you too. Um... well, it's about... long-term care. My wife... she took care of things. Paperwork and such. I don't really... remember all of it, but it has somethin' to do with makin' sure I'm okay later on, I think? It's kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, long-term care planning. That’s perfectly alright, a lot of people find it overwhelming. It sounds like your wife was proactive, which is great. Just to clarify, are you looking to establish a plan today, or are you here because something has changed with an existing one?
PATIENT: Existing, I think. She had somethin' set up. I just... need to make sure it's still good, I guess. And maybe understand it a little better. She always handled all that stuff. I didn't really pay attention, to be honest. I was more... out workin'.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Cleo. It's very common for one partner to handle those things. We can definitely go through it together. Let me pull up her records… okay, here we are. It looks like your wife established a Durable Power of Attorney for healthcare and finances, and also a living will. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Uh... yeah, those words sound familiar. Power of... somethin'. And a will... not a regular one, though, right? For when... well, you know. She said it was different. For if I couldn't... think for myself.
DOCTOR: Exactly. A living will – sometimes called an advance directive – outlines your wishes for medical care if you're unable to make decisions yourself. The Durable Power of Attorney names someone – in this case, likely you – to make those decisions on your behalf. We’ll need to confirm who's listed as your healthcare proxy. Just to get a better understanding of things now, are you currently experiencing any changes in your health that prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: No, nothin' big. Just... gettin' older, I guess. A little more tired, some aches and pains. But I can still work, still get by. It's just... I had a fall a few weeks back. Not a bad one, just tripped over a root while I was loadin' lumber. That got me thinkin', you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a fall a few weeks ago. And some fatigue and aches and pains. That’s good you're thinking about it, Cleo. Falls can be a sign of underlying issues, even if they don't seem serious at first. Can you tell me a little more about the fall?
PATIENT: It was just... clumsy. I was carryin' a bundle of wood, and my foot caught on a tree root. Went down pretty easy, thankfully. Didn't break nothin', just bruised my pride, mostly. And my shoulder's been a little sore since. I didn't go to the doctor for it, figured it'd heal on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said your shoulder's still sore?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. It's not awful, but it aches when I lift somethin' heavy. I been tryin' to take it easy, but... well, you know my job. Gotta move stuff. It's hard to avoid it.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Let's do a quick exam of your shoulder just to get a better idea of what's going on. And while we're at it, I'd like to check your balance and reflexes, just as a precaution after the fall. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure I can keep workin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here for me, and we'll get started. First, let's just check your range of motion in your shoulder. Can you raise your arm out to the side, like you’re trying to reach for something on a shelf?
PATIENT: There we go... ow. That's about as high as I can get it without it really hurtin'. It kinda feels... tight. Like somethin's pullin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does it hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. Right there. That's a bit tender. Not sharp, just... achy. Like a dull pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, and when you stand like this, do you feel steady?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm alright. A little wobbly, maybe. It's hard to stand still sometimes. I ain't as steady as I used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on the exam, it seems like you may have a mild rotator cuff strain in your shoulder, and some mild balance issues. We'll want to get an X-ray to rule out any fracture or other bony abnormalities. And I’d like to order a basic blood panel to check for underlying causes for the fatigue and balance issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. X-ray and blood work... alright. Just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we can schedule the X-ray for later today or tomorrow, whichever works best for you. In the meantime, I recommend icing your shoulder for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and avoiding lifting anything heavy. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Ice it, don't lift heavy stuff... and get the tests done. Um... about that long-term care stuff? Does all this... shoulder and balance... does that mess things up? With my wife's plan?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Cleo. Not necessarily. It's good you asked. The shoulder and balance issues, while we need to investigate them, don't automatically invalidate your wife’s plan. However, it does mean we need to update the documentation to accurately reflect your current health status. It could affect things like long-term care insurance benefits or the level of care you might qualify for, but we won’t know for sure until we have the results of the tests. We can discuss all of this in more detail once we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have a copy of the documents your wife set up?
PATIENT: I think... she had a folder. Somewhere in the house. I ain't sure where. She kept all the important papers. I'll have to look for it. It's probably in the office, or maybe the safe... I'm not good with that stuff.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Cleo. Take your time. If you can’t find them, we can try to obtain copies from the insurance companies or legal entities involved. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done and seeing what the results show. The nurse will be in shortly to get started. Do you have any other questions before I leave you to wait?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it for now, Doc. Thanks for explainin' things. And thanks for bein' patient with me. I ain't the best at rememberin' stuff.
