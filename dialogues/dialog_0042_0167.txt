DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot... it’s been hurting. A long time now. And there’s… a sore. It won’t go away. It’s on the bottom, I think. Hard to see myself these days.
DOCTOR: I see. A sore on your foot that’s been present for a while, and it’s causing you pain. That sounds uncomfortable. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me how long exactly it’s been hurting, and when you first noticed the sore?
PATIENT: Hmm… the pain… maybe six months, now? It started small, like a little ache. I didn't think much of it at first, just old age, you know? But the sore… that’s newer. Maybe two, three months? I noticed it after I cut my toenail, I think. It just didn't heal right. It's… red. And sometimes it feels warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of pain gradually increasing, and a red sore that hasn't healed for two to three months, appearing after a toenail trim. And you've noticed it feels warm. That's helpful information. Does the pain feel constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. When I walk a lot, it hurts more. Especially if I'm standing for a long time. When I sit down and rest it, it feels better. But even when I'm resting, there’s always a little ache, you know? Not bad, but… there. It’s just… bothersome. Very bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent ache with increased pain during walking and prolonged standing. Let’s talk a bit more about the sore itself. Is there any drainage coming from it?
PATIENT: Drainage? I… I don't think so. Sometimes it looks a little wet, maybe? But I thought that was just from… sweating. It's hot, you know. Hard to tell. I try to keep it clean, but… I’m not very good at seeing these days. I wipe it with a cloth after my shower. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Keeping it clean is good, Mr. Stoegbauer. It sounds like it might be a little bit of drainage, but it's understandable if it’s hard to tell. No worries. Have you noticed any changes in the color or size of the sore recently?
PATIENT: Color… maybe a little bit redder? It was pink, I think, at first. Now it’s definitely red. And… bigger. Not a lot bigger, but… I can see it easier now than I could before. It’s… worrying me, Doctor. I don’t want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer, and it’s good that you’re paying attention to these changes. We’ll definitely figure out what’s going on. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot, if that’s alright with you. Would you mind removing your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. It might be a little… smelly. I try to keep it clean, but… well, you know. Old age. There you go, Doctor. Be careful, now. It's sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I see the ulcer here on the bottom of your foot. It’s approximately one centimeter in diameter, with some surrounding redness and a little bit of warmth. There doesn’t appear to be any significant swelling or drainage at this time, but the area is tender to the touch. I also notice some thickening of the skin around the ulcer. Given the ulcer and your history of pain, it's important to rule out a few possibilities, including a possible infection or, less likely, a developing diabetic ulcer. Do you have a history of diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… I… I think so. The doctor, a long time ago, told me my sugar was a little high. He put me on pills, for a while. But I stopped taking them. They made me feel sick. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Is that bad? Is that why my foot hurts?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re letting me know about that history, Mr. Stoegbauer. Stopping the medication could explain the development of the ulcer, as uncontrolled diabetes can lead to poor circulation and nerve damage, making you more susceptible to foot problems. It’s important to get your blood sugar under control. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a blood test to check your current blood sugar levels. We’ll also want to rule out any infection. I’m going to order a wound culture to identify if any bacteria are present. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… I think I was allergic to… penicillin, maybe? When I was a boy. I got a rash. But that was a long time ago. I’m not sure. And… I don’t remember much anymore. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Very long. But I don’t think I’ve taken any medicine in years. Not since the pills for the sugar.
DOCTOR: Alright, a possible penicillin allergy in the past, and no recent medications. I will make a note of that to avoid penicillin-based antibiotics if needed. We will proceed with the blood tests and the wound culture. In the meantime, it's very important to keep weight off of your foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker you use?
PATIENT: No, no cane, no walker. I just… take it easy. But it’s hard, you know? I like to walk in the garden. It keeps me busy. I try not to put too much weight on it, but… I’m old. I fall sometimes. I don’t want to fall and make it worse. It’s a worry. Should I stay off it completely?
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Mr. Stoegbauer, and falling is something we definitely want to avoid. Given the ulcer and your history, I recommend minimizing weight-bearing on that foot as much as possible until we get the test results back. Ideally, you should avoid walking on it unless absolutely necessary. I'm going to write you a prescription for a special shoe – a walking boot – to help support your foot and reduce pressure on the ulcer. It will also help prevent falls. I’ll also give you instructions on how to care for the wound – keeping it clean and covered. We’ll need to see you back in a week to check on your progress and review the lab results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A boot, you say? Yes, that sounds good. A boot… maybe that will help. A week… yes, a week is fine. I can come back in a week. Will the tests tell me if it’s serious, Doctor? Will I… will I lose my foot?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's natural to worry. The tests will help us determine the extent of the problem. The wound culture will tell us if there's an infection present, and the blood tests will give us a clear picture of your blood sugar levels and overall health. While it’s too early to say definitively, with prompt treatment and proper care, the vast majority of these types of ulcers do not lead to amputation. We'll address any infection aggressively, get your blood sugar under control, and protect your foot with the boot. I want to emphasize that we’re taking this seriously, and we’ll work together to get you back on your feet. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. Thank you. I’m just… worried. It’s hard getting old, you know? Everything hurts. But I’m grateful for your help. I’ll see you in a week. .
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Mr. Stoegbauer. I understand it's not easy, and you are right to be concerned. We’ll do everything we can to help. Here are the prescriptions for the walking boot and instructions on wound care. Please follow them carefully. We’ll see you back in one week, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and try to stay off that foot as much as possible. .
