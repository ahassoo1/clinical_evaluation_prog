DOCTOR: Hello, Larin. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really hurting. A lot. It’s… well, it’s the cancer back, I think. It’s been good for a while, but now it’s bad again. Really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back pain. I understand you've had some issues with cancer in the past, and it sounds like the pain is returning. It's good you're getting it checked out. “Cancer back” – just to clarify, was that a diagnosis of cancer in your back, or did cancer elsewhere spread to your back?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… spread to my back. It started in… my chest, I think? And then it went to my bones. My back bones mostly. I don’t remember all the words the other doctor used. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, cancer that started in your chest and spread to your bones, including your back. I see. And it sounds like you've been doing well for a while, but now the pain is returning. Can you tell me more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Yes. Good for a long time. No pain. But now… it’s like a really heavy weight. All the time. Even when I’m just sitting. And when I move… oof. It’s sharp. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Not always, but when I bend over, for sure.
DOCTOR: A heavy weight, constant pain even at rest, and sharp pain with movement, sometimes radiating down your leg. Okay. Is the pain worse on one side of your back than the other?
PATIENT: Yes. It's… mostly on my right side. Not always bad, but when it flares up, it’s right here. And it feels… like it’s going around my hip too. Sometimes hard to tell where it starts. But mostly right side.
DOCTOR: Okay, predominantly on the right side, potentially involving the hip as well. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… lying down. That helps. And… when I take the pills. The white pills the other doctor gave me. They help a little, but not like before. Not enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and white pills provide some relief, but it’s not as effective as it once was. Do you remember the name of those pills, or perhaps what they were for?
PATIENT: No, I don’t remember the name. Just white pills. They said it was for… the pain. Bone pain. They told me to take them when it hurts. I think they made me sleepy sometimes. Sorry. I don’t remember much. It was a long time ago, and lots of doctors.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Larin. It's very common to forget details, especially with a long medical history. We'll figure things out. Now, besides the pain, have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’m tired. A lot. More than usual. And… I haven’t been eating much. No appetite. Everything tastes… funny. Not good. And I fall down sometimes. Just a little stumble, but… more than usual. I didn’t think much of it, just old. But… it’s happening more.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, loss of appetite, changes in taste, and some falls. Those are all important things to tell me. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Yes. I think so. My clothes are… looser. I haven't weighed myself, but… my family said I look thinner. They worry about me. I try to eat, but… it doesn't stay down sometimes. And I don't feel hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss. That’s concerning, and we’ll need to investigate that further. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. But… the night sweats. Yes. Sometimes I wake up… all wet. I thought it was the weather. It's hot, you know? But… it’s happening more often. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, night sweats. That's good information to have. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and examine your back to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That's okay. Whatever you need to do. I want to know what's happening. It's been worrying me so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by having you lie down on the examination table, if you're able. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal. Now, let’s focus on your back. Can you point to the exact spot where the pain is worst?
PATIENT: Here. It hurts all over, but right here is the worst. And when I push on it… oof. It goes down my leg when you push there.
DOCTOR: I'm noticing some tenderness to palpation in your lower right back, and it does seem to radiate down your leg. There’s some muscle guarding as well, which is common with pain. I also notice some decreased range of motion when you bend forward. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, your symptoms are concerning for potential progression of your cancer, likely with involvement of the bone and potentially nerves in your back. However, we need further testing to confirm this. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, to assess your overall health. I also want to get an MRI of your spine to see what’s going on with the bones and nerves in your back. Would you be able to schedule that soon?
PATIENT: MRI… yes. I can do that. Blood work too. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s happening. And… will the MRI show if the cancer is… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be anxious, Larin. An MRI will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on in your spine, including the extent of any involvement of the bones and nerves. It won't necessarily tell us if it's "bad," but it will help us determine the best course of action. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly and make a plan together. I'm going to write you a referral for the MRI and a lab requisition for the blood work. I’d like you to get those done as soon as possible. In the meantime, if your pain becomes severe or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness in your legs or difficulty controlling your bowels or bladder, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For listening. And for… trying to help. I’ll get the tests done. As soon as I can. Can my daughter come with me next time? She worries about me too. And… she remembers things better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could listen. And absolutely, your daughter is more than welcome to join you at your next appointment. It’s always helpful to have a support person, especially when dealing with something like this. Here are the referral and lab requisition. The lab is located at [gives address and phone number]. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once we have the results of the tests. Do you have any difficulty getting transportation to these appointments?
PATIENT: No. My daughter can take me. She has a car. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I think that's all. I should go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Larin. Take your time. And remember, if anything changes or you're feeling worse, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. We're here to help. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
