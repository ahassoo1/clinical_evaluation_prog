DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… lab work. That's right. Just need some lab work done. Medicare said I needed it, I think. Honestly, it all gets a bit… fuzzy. I just want to get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. It’s very common for things to feel a bit confusing with insurance and required tests. Let's try and sort it out. Do you happen to have any paperwork from Medicare detailing which lab work they’ve requested?
PATIENT: Paperwork… Let me see… I think I had something… Ah, here. I don't remember who gave it to me, or when. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. Hope this is what you need. It seems like a lot of boxes to check…
DOCTOR: Okay, this is helpful. It looks like a fairly standard annual check-up panel, with a PSA test included, which is a blood test to screen for prostate cancer. Before we proceed with the blood draw, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Prostate… cancer? Oh dear. Well, I… I mostly keep to myself. Don't really do much these days. Used to work at the power plant, you know. For… a long time. But that was… years ago. I’m pretty thin, as you can see. Don’t have much of an appetite anymore. Everything just feels… slow, these days. Not much to tell you, really. Just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're coming in to get things checked out. We're just gathering information, and the PSA test is a routine screening, especially as men get older. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. You mentioned feeling slow and having a reduced appetite. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Hmm. Well, I get up a lot at night to… you know. Use the bathroom. More than I used to. And sometimes… sometimes my bones ache. Just a dull ache, nothing sharp. And I get tired easily. Very easily. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just… old age. I’m not asking for any miracles, just want to get the lab work done so Medicare leaves me alone. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Croonquist. And those symptoms are important to note. Frequent urination, bone aches, and fatigue can be caused by a number of things, and it’s good we're talking about them. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… That's… difficult. It was a long time ago. I remember having the flu, a couple of times. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But beyond that… not much. I don't really go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. The power plant had a doctor, of course, but mostly for work-related things. Burns, cuts… things like that. I don't recall ever being seriously ill. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’m probably forgetting half of it. Is this important? Can we just get to the blood work?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. It's alright if you don’t remember everything. We’ll do our best with what we have. Knowing about major illnesses or surgeries is helpful, but it’s not a problem if you don’t recall them. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… Let me think. I think… yes. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. That's all I can remember. A long time ago. Very blurry. And… I had a small operation on my hand, at the power plant. A burn, they had to fix. But that was years ago, and I don’t remember much about it. Mostly just the pain. Is that enough? I really would like to get this over with, if you don't mind. The waiting room is… not very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Tonsillectomy and the hand surgery – we’ve got that noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… No. No, I don't take anything. Never have, really. Don't believe in them much. A bit of tea sometimes, for a sore throat. But that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I used to take something for my nerves, years ago, when I was working at the power plant. But I stopped. Didn't seem to help much anyway. Just made me feel… drowsy. Is that all you need to know? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded…
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, and you stopped taking something for nerves a long time ago. Good to know. One last question before we move on to the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had any problems. Sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy, but that’s just the dust, I think. I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty simple man. Don’t eat anything fancy. Just tea and toast, mostly. And… I get a bit sniffly around cats. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a bit of a tickle in my nose. Is that all? Can we please get this over with? I'm starting to feel very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, just a bit of sniffliness around cats. That's good to know. Okay, Mr. Croonquist. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won't take long. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Must you? I really didn’t expect all this. I just wanted the lab work. But… Alright. If you must. But please be quick. And gentle. My bones ache, you know. Just… get it over with. I'm not a fan of doctors, never have been. But I suppose I have no choice. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little high today, but it can fluctuate. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are a bit quiet, and your lungs sound a little faint, but nothing immediately concerning. Let me take a look in your ears… Your ears look clear. Now, let me just take a quick look in your nose and throat. Your throat is a little dry, but otherwise looks fine. Everything seems okay at first glance, but we'll have a better idea once we get the lab results back.
PATIENT: That's… unpleasant. See? I told you my throat was dry. Lab results… How long will those take? And what exactly are we looking for? Honestly, Doctor, I don't understand any of this. Just tell me if I’m going to die, alright? That’s all I want to know. I’m an old man. I’ve had a long life. Don’t bother with fancy words. Just… tell me straight. And then can I please go home? This chair is killing my back. .
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Croonquist. I won’t give you vague answers. We’re looking at a few things with these tests. The Complete Blood Count will tell us about your red and white blood cells, which can help identify infections or anemia. The Comprehensive Metabolic Panel checks your kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, and electrolytes. The Lipid Panel looks at your cholesterol levels. And the PSA test checks for signs of prostate cancer. It's important to remember that an elevated PSA level doesn't automatically mean you have cancer. It can be raised by other factors, such as infection or an enlarged prostate. We'll need to interpret the results in combination with your symptoms and the physical exam. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan. I want to assure you that we’re not jumping to any conclusions. We’re simply gathering information to get a better understanding of your overall health. It's good you came in to get things checked out. For now, let’s focus on getting you comfortable. Would you like me to get you a glass of water?
