DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I am Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, she says I need to get some papers. Something about… time off? Or maybe help with things… I don’t quite remember exactly what she said. It’s something official, she kept mentioning paperwork. Is that what this is about? FMLA… something like that? She’s very organized, my wife, but sometimes… well, things slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: FMLA… yes, potentially. Your wife is anticipating a need for leave, then?
PATIENT: Leave… right. Yes, that sounds about right. I… I’ve been feeling a bit… off, lately. Not sick, exactly. Just… tired, mostly. And a little confused sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It’s been going on for a little while, I think. Not sure how long, truthfully. My wife handles most of that sort of thing, you see. Is this the kind of thing that requires papers? I really don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: “A bit off,” you say. Right. Well, “a bit off” could mean many things, Mr. Limtiaco. Let’s try to be precise. When you say “tired,” is this fatigue constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate… yes, that’s a good word for it. It comes and goes. Some days I feel… well, almost normal. Other days, like getting out of bed is a real effort. And the confusion… that seems to be worse when I'm tired, I think. It’s like… words don't come as easily, or I forget what I was talking about mid-sentence. Does that make sense? It’s not a constant thing, but it’s… concerning, I suppose. My wife is very concerned, which is why we're here.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long ago did you first notice this fatigue and… cognitive difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Let me think… It feels like… several months, maybe? Six months, perhaps? It started slowly, very gradually. I didn’t really pay much attention at first. Just thought I was getting older, you know? A little more forgetful, a little more tired… That sort of thing. My wife noticed it before I did, definitely. She has a very good memory. She kept saying I was repeating myself, or asking the same questions. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “gradually” is not particularly helpful for diagnostic purposes, Mr. Limtiaco. Let’s move on. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me see. I… I've been having a little trouble sleeping, sometimes. Not every night, but… restless sleep, you know? And I’ve noticed my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don't feel unwell, exactly, but I'm not really hungry most of the time. Oh, and… this is going to sound strange, but I seem to be a bit more… clumsy than usual. Bumping into things, dropping things… little things, really. Nothing serious. My wife says I shouldn't ignore even the little things, though. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: Restless sleep, decreased appetite, increased clumsiness. Very well. Now, Mr. Limtiaco, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, my wife says, but it was managed with diet and exercise. Nothing that required regular medication, if I remember correctly. And… I had a knee replacement about ten years ago, but that healed up fine. Other than that… no, not that I'm aware of. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. That’s why this is all so… puzzling. My wife keeps saying I should see a specialist, but I’m not sure what kind of specialist would help.
DOCTOR: A knee replacement… alright. And no history of stroke, head injury, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. I… I’ve been very lucky, I think. No major accidents or illnesses. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? I’ve never had a head injury, to my knowledge. No strokes. Never been in a serious accident. My wife always makes sure I’m careful, especially when I’m driving. She’s a good woman, really. She worries, but… it’s because she cares. I just wish I could remember more details for you, Doctor. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, like my wife mentioned, but it’s… very low dose. She manages the refills, so I don’t really pay attention to the name. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when my knee flares up. Just the over-the-counter kind, though. Nothing else, I don’t think. Oh, wait! She gives me a vitamin D supplement sometimes, because she says I don't get enough sun. But that’s it. Really. I try to stay away from pills if I can. My wife makes sure I'm eating healthy, so I don’t need much medication, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, vitamin D supplement. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My wife always checks that sort of thing before giving me anything. She’s very careful. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, to my knowledge. She keeps a list of everything I've ever taken, just in case. I'm lucky to have her, really. She thinks of everything. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor, but my memory… it's just not what it used to be. I feel like I'm letting you down.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, with all due respect, a detailed medical history requires your input, not solely your wife’s recollection. Now, let us proceed with a brief physical examination. Please follow my instructions. I want you to stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes, of course. You're right. I should be trying harder. I… I just get flustered sometimes. Okay. Stand up… There we go. Is that alright? I feel a bit… wobbly. My balance isn’t the best these days, either. But I'm trying, Doctor. I promise. Just let me know what you want me to do. I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, and you exhibit some mild base-wide instability. Now, please sit back down. I will check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. . Your reflexes are diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. . Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. . Given your symptoms and examination findings, I suspect mild cognitive impairment, potentially exacerbated by age-related changes. However, further investigation is required to rule out other possible causes.
PATIENT: Mild… cognitive impairment? That sounds… serious. Is that… what’s causing me to forget things? My wife has been saying I should see someone about that. But… what does that mean exactly? And what kind of “further investigation” are we talking about? Will it be painful? I don’t want to be poked and prodded too much. My wife will be very worried. She's always been very protective of me. Is this something… treatable? I hope it's not…
DOCTOR: "Mild cognitive impairment" simply means there's been a subtle decline in your mental function—memory, thinking, reasoning. It doesn't necessarily indicate dementia, but it requires evaluation. The investigation will involve blood work to rule out vitamin deficiencies and thyroid issues, and potentially a brain scan—an MRI—to assess for structural abnormalities. The MRI is non-invasive—it doesn't involve any poking or prodding—but it does require you to lie still for a period of time. Whether it’s treatable depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, it can be managed with medication and lifestyle modifications. However, I recommend a consultation with a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss your options. I will write a referral for you now. . And Mr. Limtiaco, it is crucial that your wife accompany you to this appointment, as her input will be invaluable.
PATIENT: A neurologist… and a brain scan… Oh dear. That sounds… very serious indeed. My wife is going to be very upset. She always worries so much. Will this… will this mean I can't drive anymore? Or… or do the things I enjoy? I like to garden, you know. And… and I volunteer at the church. I don’t want to lose my independence. And what about… what about this paperwork she wanted? The FMLA… is this related to all of this? Will I need time off work if… if it’s serious? I just want to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, one step at a time. We have not yet established a diagnosis. The referral is simply for a more comprehensive assessment. Regarding your ability to drive or continue your activities, that will depend on the neurologist’s findings. The FMLA paperwork is unrelated—it concerns your wife’s potential need for leave, not your medical condition. I have other patients waiting. I’ve written a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist. Schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. And, Mr. Limtiaco, please try to remain calm. Worrying will not help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. Tell Dr. Vance I… I’m very forgetful. That might be important. And thank you again. I hope it’s not… too serious. .
DOCTOR: .
