DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 65 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, sixty-five, goin' on seventy if this fever keeps up. It's this… well, this fever. Keeps comin' back. It's just… annoying, mostly. I wanna get rid of it, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A recurring fever that's mostly just annoying. Let's try to figure out what might be causing it. When did you first notice the fever starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, jeez. Maybe three, four weeks ago? It comes and goes. Like clockwork, almost. A couple days feelin' okay, then bam, fever again. It's not high, not like I need to go to the hospital high, just… uncomfortable. Enough to make you feel lousy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about three or four weeks ago, it started coming and going, not severely high but enough to make you feel unwell. And you said it feels almost like clockwork?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Every… three, four days maybe? Hard to say exactly. My wife, Elena, she keeps track of these things better than I do. She'll tell you, I forget everything. But it's definitely regular. Not just random spikes. It’s… frustrating, you know? I just wanna feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Brege. It's good that Elena is keeping track – that's very helpful. So, roughly every three to four days you experience a fever. Aside from the fever itself, are you experiencing any other symptoms when it comes on?
PATIENT: Yeah, now that you mention it… I get a little achy. Not bad, just… like I’ve been workin' in the garden all day. And tired. Real tired. Don’t have much energy when it hits. No cough, no sniffles, nothin' like a cold. Just… achy and sleepy. And thirsty. Real thirsty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so achiness, fatigue, and increased thirst accompany the fever. And no cold symptoms, which is good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Nah, appetite’s been okay. Elena makes me good food, I always eat. Maybe a little less when the fever’s got me down, but I still eat. She worries about me not eatin' enough, but I'm okay. I just don’t feel like doin’ much of anything when I’m sick. Mostly just wanna lie down.
DOCTOR: Alright, so appetite remains relatively stable, though you lose some motivation when you’re feeling unwell. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven’t left Puerto Rico in… oh, must be ten years now? And no, nobody I know’s been sick. Elena and I mostly stay to ourselves. We go to church, see our grandkids sometimes… but nobody's coughin' or sneezin' when we see 'em. It's just… this fever. It’s a puzzle.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel or known exposure to illness. That's helpful information. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. I used to pull my back sometimes, bein' a chiropractor and all, but I mostly stay sittin’ now. Elena always tells me to take it easy. She’s a good woman. No… I don’t have anythin’ major. Just gettin’ old, I guess. And this fever. I don’t take any pills regularly, either. Not for nothin', anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic medical conditions and no regular medications. That’s good. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Back surgery, maybe thirty years ago? A slipped disc, somethin’ like that. It was a long time ago, and it healed up fine. Other than that… nope. Not that I can remember. I get a little foggy on the details sometimes, you know? Elena keeps all my records. She's really organized.
DOCTOR: Alright, a back surgery about thirty years ago that healed well. That's good to know. And you mentioned Elena keeps your records - that’s very helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had no allergies. I eat everything Elena puts in front of me, and she puts a lot of stuff in front of me. Not allergic to nothin’ as far as I know. She’d know if I was, though. She's always askin' me if I'm feelin' okay after I eat somethin' new. A good woman, really. I just want this fever to go away. It's wearin' me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, before we proceed, let me quickly review your height and weight on my system. I see you are 5'0" and 121 pounds. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Five foot nothin', and… well, I used to be heavier. Elena says I’m too skinny, but I feel okay. She worries too much, that woman. But yeah, those numbers are about right. Small fella, always have been. Now, can we figure out this fever? It’s drivin’ me crazy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Thank you for sharing all of that information. It sounds like you've been dealing with this recurring fever for several weeks now, with accompanying aches and fatigue, and no known allergies or chronic medical conditions. To help me understand what might be causing this, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just wanna get rid of this fever. I’m tired of feelin’ lousy. Do what you gotta do. Just… don't poke me too much. Old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brege. I'll be as gentle as possible. Your temperature is currently 100.8°F, your pulse is 88 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Your throat looks clear, and your ears and nose also appear normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Overall, you appear slightly fatigued but are in stable condition. Everything appears normal on initial examination, Mr. Brege. However, given the recurring nature of your fever, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying infection or inflammatory condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever it takes, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… I don't have insurance, so… how much is this gonna cost? Elena’s gonna kill me if I rack up a big bill. She worries about money more than she worries about me sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Brege. We can discuss the cost of the tests and explore options to minimize expenses. I'll ask the lab to provide a cost estimate beforehand, and our billing department can also help you understand any potential financial assistance programs. We'll do our best to work with you. The blood tests I'd like to order include a complete blood count , a metabolic panel, and a sedimentation rate to check for inflammation. These tests will give us a better understanding of what might be causing your recurring fever. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Sounds… complicated. You’re the Doctor, you know best. Just… how long ‘til we get the results? I wanna get this over with. I got grandkids to see, you know? I don’t wanna be stuck in bed missin’ out on stuff. And… can I still go to church on Sunday? Elena would be mad if I missed church.
DOCTOR: I understand your eagerness to get this resolved, Mr. Brege, and wanting to keep your Sunday plans. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We should have them by Tuesday at the latest. As for going to church on Sunday, that depends on how you're feeling. If you continue to have a fever or feel unwell, it's best to rest and avoid spreading any potential illness. If you feel well enough, you can certainly attend, but please take it easy and monitor your symptoms. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. If your fever spikes above 101.5°F or you develop any new symptoms, such as a severe headache, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please contact us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… reasonable. Rest, drink fluids, don't push myself… Elena’s been tellin’ me that for years anyway. And call if it gets worse. Okay, I can do that. So… is that it? Can I go now? I gotta go pick up some pastries for Elena. She loves those little almond cookies… And she’s gonna be lookin’ for me. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brege, that is it for today. We’ll call you as soon as the lab results are available, and we’ll discuss the next steps at that time. Here's a copy of the after-visit summary for your records. It includes a list of the tests we ordered, instructions on what to do in the meantime, and contact information for our office. Please feel free to call us with any questions or concerns. And enjoy those pastries with Elena! Get well soon, Mr. Brege.
