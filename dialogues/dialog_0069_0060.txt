DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it's…family history, mostly. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… well, it wasn't pretty. Lots of heart trouble. And my uncle, her son, same thing. Died young. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. Preventative, you know? Don't want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: I understand, Blain. It’s very responsible of you to think about preventative care, especially with a family history of heart trouble. It’s good you’re being proactive. Okay, so you're concerned about potential heart issues due to your grandmother and uncle’s history. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about what specifically happened with them?
PATIENT: Specifically? Ugh. Well, my grandmother, she had… I don't know, something with her valves? They kept saying things I didn’t understand. Lots of swelling, couldn’t breathe. Eventually, she had surgery, but it didn't help much. She was always tired, even before the surgery. And my uncle… he just collapsed. Healthy one day, gone the next. They said it was a heart attack. I think it was pretty sudden. Honestly, the doctors never explained it very well to my mother, and she… she doesn’t do well with medical stuff. So, I’m mostly going off what she told me, which isn't a lot.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds understandably stressful, and it’s completely reasonable you’d want to get things checked out given that history. It's good you're taking charge of your health, especially when information feels unclear. So, grandmother had valve issues with swelling and breathing problems, ultimately needing surgery, and your uncle experienced a sudden cardiac event. To help me get a clearer picture, let’s go through some of your own health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, a broken arm once – but nothing serious. I haven’t really been to the doctor much since college. I'm pretty healthy, I think. I exercise, I eat okay... well, mostly okay. I had my cholesterol checked a few years back during a physical for work, and it was normal, I think. But that was a while ago. I just… I don’t like going to doctors, to be honest. Feels like they always try to find something wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand that feeling. It's good to hear you're generally healthy and active, and that your cholesterol was normal a few years back. It’s still important to stay on top of things, especially with your family history. Okay, no prior medical conditions. You exercise and eat relatively well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Like I said, broken arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. No operations, no serious illnesses. I’m… lucky, I guess. It just feels weird being here, worrying about things that haven’t even happened yet. My ex-wife, she was always getting sick, always at the doctor. I always thought I was different. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: It’s completely normal to feel unsettled when thinking about potential future health concerns, especially when you've been healthy in the past. It’s good you’re addressing this proactively, and it doesn’t mean you’re necessarily going to experience the same issues as your family members. Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family history a bit more specifically. Besides your grandmother and uncle, has anyone else in your family had heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, let me think. My mother's brother… he has high blood pressure, I think. She complains about him always needing pills. And… my grandfather on my father’s side, he had something with his…circulation? He lost a foot, I think. That was a long time ago, though. I honestly don’t pay that much attention to everyone’s medical woes. It’s depressing. Is this going to be a long list? Because frankly, I have things to do. I’m not trying to be difficult, it’s just… it feels like we’re digging up a lot of bad news.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can feel overwhelming, and I appreciate your honesty. We can move as quickly or slowly as you're comfortable with. Okay, so we have an uncle with high blood pressure, and a grandfather with circulation issues leading to foot loss. That gives us a little more information. Now, switching gears a bit – do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty… resilient. Honestly, I think this whole thing is a bit of a waste of time. But I’m here, I guess. Just tell me I’m fine and I’ll be on my way. Is that too much to ask? I really don’t want to spend my Saturday in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I wish I could just tell you everything is fine without a thorough check. However, given your family history, it's important to rule things out, even if it means a little inconvenience today. It’s always better to be safe and have a clear understanding of your health. Okay, no known allergies. Lastly, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t take anything. I believe in…natural health. And honestly, I don’t trust those pharmaceutical companies. They just want to sell you pills. I get all my vitamins from my food. Maybe I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Definitely nothing regular. This is…getting ridiculous. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, maybe a multivitamin occasionally. Alright, Blain, thank you for that information. Given your family history and your concern about preventative care, I'd like to do a basic physical exam and order some blood tests to get a baseline understanding of your health. This will include checking your blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol levels, and a few other key indicators. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But don’t tell me I need to start taking pills or something. And if it’s going to take forever, I’m leaving. I really don’t have all day. Just…get it over with. I’m really not a fan of doctors, you know? This is all very… stressful. Can we at least do it quickly?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it as quick and efficient as possible. It won’t take long at all. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I'll check your blood pressure. After that, we can do a quick look at your overall health. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…try not to poke me too much. And don't tell me to breathe deeply or anything. I hate that. Honestly, the whole thing is just…demeaning. But okay, fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just hurry. It’s a Saturday, you know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathe normally. I'm just listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Everything sounds good so far. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Ugh. This is uncomfortable. And cold. Honestly, I’m really not liking this. Can we just skip the tests and tell me everything’s fine? I’m starting to feel anxious. I knew I shouldn't have come. This is exactly why I avoid doctors. Just…hurry up. I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 122/78. That’s within the normal range. Everything is looking good so far, Blain. Just to complete the basic check, I’d like to briefly examine your abdomen and listen to your heart again while you sit up. This will only take a moment. I understand you’re feeling anxious, and I’ll make sure everything is as quick and comfortable as possible. This will give me a better overall picture, and if everything checks out, we can discuss a plan for preventative care based on your family history. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But no poking. Seriously. And if I start to feel lightheaded, you stop. Immediately. I really don't want to end up collapsing in your office. And honestly, I still think this is a waste of time, but okay, fine. Get it over with. But be gentle. And quick. Seriously, quick. I have things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No poking, I promise. And we’ll stop immediately if you feel lightheaded or uncomfortable in any way. I’ll be very gentle. Everything feels soft and normal here, no tenderness. Still regular, no changes. Okay, everything sounds and feels good. Now, to get a more comprehensive picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. This will include a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood tests? Seriously? Can't we just…forget the whole thing? I feel fine. I am fine. My mother always said I was a robust specimen. Honestly, this is ridiculous. But okay, fine. If you have to. But I really don’t want to see a needle. And don’t tell me it will barely hurt. I hate needles. Just…get it over with. Quickly. And don’t make a fuss. Honestly, the whole thing is…demeaning.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about needles, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is aware. They’re very skilled and will be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s a standard procedure, and it will provide valuable information. I’ll have the lab order sent to the lab downstairs. They’ll call your name when they’re ready. It shouldn’t take long. While you’re waiting for the lab, I can discuss some preventative lifestyle changes you can make, based on your family history. This includes maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? You’re telling me about lifestyle changes? Honestly. I eat perfectly fine. I exercise. I don’t smoke. This is…condescending. You think I haven’t heard this before? My ex-wife was obsessed with wellness blogs. I’ve heard it all. Just…send me to the lab. I want to get out of here. This whole thing is a waste of my Saturday. And frankly, it’s insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I came across as condescending, Blain. That wasn’t my intention. It’s just standard practice to discuss preventative measures with patients who have a family history of health concerns. Alright, let’s skip that for now. I’ll have the lab technician come get you when they're ready. They’ll explain the procedure and answer any questions you have. Just try to relax, and let me know if you feel lightheaded or unwell at any time. I'll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Hi Blain, Dr. Andraca said you're ready for a few blood tests. If you'll follow me, I'll get you set up.
PATIENT: .
