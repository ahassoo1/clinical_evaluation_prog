DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Duplichan! It's nice to meet you. Well, I've just been getting the chills lately, and it's a bit worrying me. It's not like a fever, just… cold. Like, shivers, you know?
DOCTOR: "Just cold," you say. Hmm. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… probably about three days now? It comes and goes, but it's definitely been happening for at least three days. It's not constant, thankfully. It's more noticeable in the evenings, I think.
DOCTOR: Three days. And are you experiencing anything else alongside these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little tired, but honestly, who isn't these days? No cough, no sore throat, no aches… just the cold shivers. I did feel a bit off yesterday, but I thought it was just because I didn’t get enough sleep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "A little tired" and "a bit off" are vague, Ms. Aslan. But alright. Have you been checking your temperature at all?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t, actually. I don’t really have a thermometer at home. I usually only bother with that if I feel really sick, you know? Like, with a proper fever or something. I figured if it was serious, I’d feel worse than just… chilly. But maybe I should have?
DOCTOR: It's always best to have a baseline, Ms. Aslan. Especially when you’re presenting with something unusual. Now, let's move on. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I haven't left town in months! Work's been pretty busy, and honestly, I just haven't had the time or energy. I’m a health educator, so I mostly just stay around here, running workshops and stuff. Nothing exciting, unfortunately. Do you think travel could be the cause?
DOCTOR: It’s a possibility we must rule out, Ms. Aslan. Even domestic travel. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I mean, I had the flu a couple of years ago, but that’s it. And I'm a bit prone to headaches, but everyone gets those, right? Oh, and my doctor back home used to say my blood pressure was a little high, but it was never anything that needed medication or anything. Just to watch it, he said. Does that count?
DOCTOR: "A bit prone to headaches" and "a little high" are still imprecise, Ms. Aslan. Do you know your typical blood pressure reading?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, no, not off the top of my head. I’m terrible with numbers, honestly. I think it was around 130 over 80, maybe? But that was years ago, and it could be totally wrong. He just said to keep an eye on it and cut back on salt. Sorry, I wish I was more helpful! I just… don’t really remember the details.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any family history of… anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… my grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes, and my uncle has heart problems. But other than that, nothing really stands out. My mom is perfectly healthy, and my dad passed away when I was young, so I don’t know much about his medical history, unfortunately. It’s a bit sad, actually. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It’s… something. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. Nothing special. I try to eat healthy, but you know, it’s good to have a little backup, right? I take one every morning with breakfast. And occasionally, if I'm feeling run down, I'll take some vitamin C, but that’s it. Definitely no prescription medications or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’m usually pretty good, thankfully. I’m not one of those people with a long list of sensitivities, which is a relief, honestly. Is that all the questions? I feel like I’m being interrogated!
DOCTOR: You are providing rather vague answers, Ms. Aslan. But, alright. Let’s proceed to a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your temperature.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. I hope everything's okay. I really don't like being sick. Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles auscultated. Heart rate is regular, normal S1 and S2 sounds. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Your vitals are within normal limits, Ms. Aslan. However, your presentation is… unusual.
PATIENT: Unusual? Oh dear. What do you mean? Is it something serious? I was hoping it was just a little bug going around. Is there anything I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. The lack of fever and other typical symptoms is… atypical. It could be a mild viral infection, but the chills persisting for three days warrant further evaluation. Given your history, or rather, the lack of a detailed history, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. This will help rule out any underlying inflammatory processes or electrolyte imbalances. I'm also going to order a TSH test to check your thyroid function. A slightly off thyroid can sometimes present with vague symptoms like chills and fatigue. We’ll need a blood sample from the lab. Do you have any issues with blood draws?
PATIENT: Oh wow, that’s… a lot of tests. Okay. No, I don’t think I have any issues with blood draws. I’ve had them before, I think. It’s just… I always get a little nervous. It’s probably silly. And what does TSH mean? Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: TSH stands for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. It’s a routine test. It’s unlikely to be serious, but it’s important to rule things out. It helps determine if your thyroid is functioning properly. Now, I’m going to provide you with a lab requisition form. Please take this to the lab downstairs. They will draw the blood samples. After the lab work is complete, we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. I'll also give you a prescription for a multivitamin with extra Vitamin D – a deficiency can sometimes cause vague symptoms. I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you develop a fever, severe headache, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Okay, a lab test, a multivitamin, and keep an eye out for anything worse. Vitamin D… that makes sense. I do spend a lot of time indoors. Do you think it could be stress? Work has been really hectic lately. And will the lab tell me the results, or do I need to come back here?
DOCTOR: Stress can exacerbate many conditions, Ms. Aslan, but it rarely presents as isolated chills. We need objective data, not speculation. The lab will send the results directly to me. You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. The receptionist will handle that for you. I recommend scheduling the appointment for next week, allowing sufficient time for the lab work to be processed. And, I strongly advise you to prioritize stress management techniques. Perhaps consider incorporating regular exercise or mindfulness practices into your routine. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Duplichan. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if I haven’t been very helpful with details. I’ll go schedule that follow-up appointment and try to relax a little. I hope it’s nothing serious. .
