DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my… my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble getting things going when I need to pee. It’s not painful, just… difficult. It feels like it takes a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like I empty everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty starting and a feeling of incomplete emptying, and no pain. That's good to know. And this is a recent change, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… well, let me think. It started maybe three months ago, I’d say. At first, I didn't think much of it, just put it down to… drinking too much tea, maybe. But it hasn't gotten better, and now it's a bit bothersome. It's definitely not something that just goes away on its own, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it's good you’re getting it checked out. Three months is definitely long enough to warrant a look. And you're right to think it shouldn't just resolve on its own. Now, can you tell me a bit more about how much fluid you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I drink a lot of tea, like I said. Maybe… six or seven cups a day? Black tea, mostly. And I have some water with my meals, perhaps two glasses. I don't drink soda or juice very often. Is that too much? I always thought tea was good for you.
DOCTOR: Six to seven cups of tea is quite a bit, and black tea can have a diuretic effect, meaning it can make you pee more often. It also contains caffeine, which can sometimes contribute to bladder irritation. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: Oh, I hadn't thought of that. Hmm... let me see. I suppose I have been getting up more at night to go to the bathroom. Not every night, but more often than I used to. And… sometimes, just a little dribbling after I finish. It’s not a lot, but enough to… well, you know. Is that the irritation you mentioned? It’s a little embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Kandy. This is what I’m here for, and it’s important information. Getting up more at night – that’s nocturia – and the dribbling after urination are both helpful to know. Now, do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Absolutely none. Like I said before, it's just… difficult to start, and it doesn't feel like I empty everything. And the dribbling, of course, but no burning or discomfort. It just feels… incomplete, you know? Like there's still something left in there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, no pain, no burning, difficulty initiating the stream, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and nocturia. Okay. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it... yes, a little. I've been a bit… stopped up, lately. Not terribly bad, but not as regular as I used to be. It's been happening around the same time as the trouble with my waterworks, actually. I thought it was just old age catching up with me! Is that connected, do you think? I do try to eat my prunes… sometimes.
DOCTOR: It absolutely could be connected, Kandy. Constipation can sometimes put pressure on the bladder and affect urination. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s well controlled with medication. I take a small pill every morning. And I had my gallbladder out years ago, in 1987, I believe. Apart from that, I’m fairly healthy for my age, I think. I try to stay active, walk every day if the weather allows. I have Medicare, if that's important. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Controlled hypertension and a gallbladder removal in 1987. And Medicare is good to have! Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I’ve taken antibiotics, pain relievers… all sorts of things over the years, and never any trouble. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I haven’t inherited that, thankfully. I always tell the pharmacist everything, just in case, but they haven’t found anything to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned you take a medication for your blood pressure. What's the name of that medication, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think… it’s a little white pill. I have to write it down. Just a moment… Ah, here it is. It's Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. I haven't missed a dose in years, I don't think. I have a little pill organizer to keep track. Old age, you know!
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good job keeping track of that. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… My father had heart trouble, he passed away when he was 78. And my mother had diabetes, she had to take insulin shots for years. My brother, he has arthritis in his knees, very painful, he says. As far as I know, nobody in my family had any trouble with their bladder, or kidneys, or anything like that. It seems to be a new problem for me. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, a history of heart disease and diabetes in the family. Okay. Finally, can you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What do you want to know? Well, I live alone in my house. I’ve been single for… a very long time. I have a few friends, we see each other occasionally, mostly for tea and biscuits. I used to be a gardener, but my back isn't what it used to be, so I don't do much of that anymore. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but I cut back a few years ago. I try to stay active, as I mentioned before, walk every day if the weather is nice. Is there anything else? I hope I’m not boring you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Kandy. This is all very helpful. Okay, so you live alone, active lifestyle, no smoking, limited alcohol. Alright. I think I have a good picture of what's going on. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll feel your abdomen. And finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. It won’t be painful, just a few simple tests. Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness. I can feel your bladder is a bit full. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It feels a bit strange being examined like this, but I understand it’s necessary. I hope you don’t find anything too alarming. My mother always said I worried too much.
DOCTOR: Everything looks good so far, Kandy. Your reflexes are normal. Given your symptoms – difficulty starting urination, a sensation of incomplete emptying, nocturia, and the constipation – and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing urinary retention, possibly with an element of overflow incontinence. The constipation could also be contributing. It's also possible there's a component of overactive bladder contributing to the nocturia. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a urinalysis to check for infection. Second, a post-void residual to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you empty it. And finally, I’d like to check your kidney function with a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… complicated. Urinary retention, overflow incontinence… those are big words. And a post-void residual? Is that going to be… uncomfortable? I’m not sure I understand everything you said. Is it serious? And what’s a basic metabolic panel? I feel a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. Perhaps you could explain it to me in simpler terms? I’m just an old woman who wants to be able to pee normally!
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for clarification, Kandy, and it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Let’s break it down. Urinary retention simply means your bladder isn’t emptying completely. Overflow incontinence is when your bladder gets so full that it leaks a little bit. It’s not serious in most cases, but it's important to find out why it's happening. A post-void residual is a quick test where we measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you pee. It's not painful – it just involves a quick scan with a handheld device. It helps us see how well your bladder is emptying. A basic metabolic panel is a blood test that checks your kidney function and electrolytes. It helps us make sure your kidneys are working properly. Essentially, we need to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms and make sure everything is functioning as it should. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make a little more sense, thank you. So, you want to see how well my bladder empties, and make sure my kidneys are okay. And the scan isn’t painful? That's good to know. Okay, alright. I suppose I can have the tests. When will I get the results? And who will tell me what they mean? I hope it’s not anything too serious. My brother always said I worry too much, but it’s hard not to when you don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. And you're right, it’s perfectly natural to worry. The lab should have the results within a few days, usually 2-3 business days. I will personally review them and call you as soon as I have them to discuss the findings and next steps. I’ll explain everything in detail, and we’ll come up with a plan together. We’ll likely start with some conservative measures, like timed voiding – that's simply going to the bathroom on a schedule – and ensuring you stay well-hydrated. We might also discuss some pelvic floor exercises to strengthen your bladder muscles. If those don’t help, we can explore other options. In the meantime, try to avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, and make sure you're not straining when you pee. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve explained it very clearly, Doctor. And you’re right, I do drink a lot of tea. I’ll try to cut back, I promise. Timed voiding… that sounds manageable. And pelvic floor exercises… I’ll have to look those up. Thank you for your patience with me. I know I worry too much, and I ask a lot of questions. You’re a very kind doctor. I suppose I’m all finished then? I should go and… empty my bladder again, just in case.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. It’s my job to answer your questions, and I’m glad I could help ease your worries. And don’t worry about asking questions—it’s the best way to be informed. Yes, I think you’re all finished for today. Please do go and empty your bladder when you’re ready. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Here’s a pamphlet with some information about timed voiding and pelvic floor exercises to get you started. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call you. Have a good day, Kandy, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
