DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I am Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Paraskevopoulos, you say? Fancy name. Well, to be frank, I just need a little somethin’ from you. A card, see? My daughter, she’s… particular. She says I need a “Get Well” card, or somethin’ encouragin’. From the doctor. She thinks it’ll… help my spirits. Honestly, I feel fine. But a man does what a man must.
DOCTOR: I see. A medical note for…emotional reassurance. While I appreciate your daughter’s concern, Mr. Kammer, my role is to address legitimate medical concerns. A note solely for the purpose of bolstering spirits is… unconventional. However, I am willing to document your visit. To do so accurately, could you elaborate on why your daughter believes you require such documentation?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Now hold on a minute. You’re makin’ this harder than it needs to be. She just thinks I’m… low. After the divorce, you understand. Empty nest and all that. She worries. Always has. Says I need to “validate my feelings.” Whatever that means. I told her I’m fine! Been workin’ steady, keepin’ busy. But she’s… insistent. It’s just a card, Doctor. A little piece of paper. And she wants your signature. She trusts doctors, I guess. More than her own father, it seems.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your daughter is concerned about your emotional well-being following the divorce and your children leaving home. It is not uncommon for individuals to experience periods of adjustment after significant life changes. However, simply writing a note stating you “feel fine” is not a sufficient medical assessment. To provide appropriate documentation, and to ensure I am not overlooking any underlying issues, allow me to ask a few questions regarding your current state of mind. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, now… my appetite’s been alright. Still eat a good breakfast, you know? Bacon and eggs. Can’t beat that. Sleep… sleep’s been… fidgety. Not bad, but I wake up a few times. Thinking. Mostly about work, though. Gotta make sure everything’s runnin’ smooth at the plant. Old boilers don't fix themselves, you know. It’s not like I'm tossin’ and turnin’ all night, worryin’ and such. Just… a little more restless than usual. Is that what you’re askin’? It’s nothin’ a little coffee can’t fix.
DOCTOR: I see. Restless sleep, occasionally waking during the night with thoughts primarily concerning your work. That is…helpful. Have you noticed any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Now that’s a strong word, Doctor. I ain’t hopeless. I got my job, got my health, mostly. And I see my grandkids every other weekend. That’s somethin’. Sadness… well, sometimes I miss the kids bein’ around the house, sure. But that’s natural, right? Every father misses his children. Loss of interest… not really. I still like fishin’, still tinker with my model trains. I keep busy. I don’t sit around mopin’, if that’s what you’re gettin’ at. Honestly, I think my daughter is makin’ a mountain out of a molehill. She always was a dramatic one.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while it is certainly positive that you maintain your hobbies and social connections, and that you haven’t reported a complete loss of interest in activities, the intermittent sleep disturbances and acknowledging a degree of sadness following significant life events warrants further consideration. To complete a more thorough assessment, allow me to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with, or received treatment for, depression, anxiety, or any other mental health condition?
PATIENT: Mental health condition? Doctor, are you tryin’ to tell me somethin’s wrong with me? I been workin' hard my whole life, takin’ care of business. Never needed no fancy diagnoses. Never been to a shrink, never will. The only condition I got is a bad back from bendin’ over those boilers all these years. And a stubborn daughter. That's about it. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I deal with things. I don’t sit around wallowin’ in… whatever it is people wallow in. I just want the card, so I can be done with this. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I assure you, I am not implying anything is inherently “wrong” with you. My role as a physician is to conduct a comprehensive assessment to ensure all aspects of your health are considered. Your daughter's concern, combined with your reported sleep disturbances and acknowledgment of sadness, simply prompts me to ask pertinent questions. However, if you are adamant about forgoing a detailed assessment, I can certainly document your visit and provide a brief note stating you are currently experiencing intermittent sleep disturbances and adjusting to recent life changes. However, it will not be a comprehensive medical evaluation, and I strongly recommend considering a consultation with a mental health professional. Before proceeding, let me ask one final question: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been much of a pill-popper. A little coffee in the mornin’, that’s about it. Maybe an aspirin if my back’s really botherin' me. But that’s it. Just good, hard work and a strong will, that’s what keeps me goin’. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, I really do. But I’m a simple man. I don’t need a fancy diagnosis, or a shrink tellin’ me how to feel. I just want the card, so my daughter will leave me alone. Can we just… get this over with? Write whatever you need to write, just so I can go home. And maybe, just maybe, she’ll stop worryin’ so much.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. As you wish. “To Whom It May Concern: Mr. Early Kammer presented today reporting intermittent sleep disturbances and is currently adjusting to recent life changes. He denies any current complaints of significant medical or psychological distress. He is a generally healthy and active individual. Sincerely, Bradlee Paraskevopoulos, MD” Here you are. I trust this will suffice. However, I reiterate my recommendation for a mental health consultation. Adjusting to significant life changes can be challenging, and seeking professional support is a sign of strength, not weakness. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: That’ll do. That’ll do just fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you writin’ that down. Now, if you’ll excuse me… …I got boilers to check.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammer. Have a good day.
