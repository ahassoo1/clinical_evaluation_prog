DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure I can explain it well. I was advised to come and discuss… plans for the future, should something happen. Something about making sure my wishes are known? It was suggested I fill out some forms… an Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST? I don’t recall the specifics. It's all rather… hazy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It can be a bit overwhelming to think about, and it's very responsible of you to be proactive. It sounds like someone suggested you come in to discuss advance care planning – things like a living will or a POLST form, as you mentioned. Those are documents that outline your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. Before we get into the specifics of those forms, could you tell me a little bit more about why someone suggested you consider these now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… difficult to recall precisely. I believe it was after… a rather unpleasant incident. A fall, I think? Or perhaps a brief illness? It wasn't serious, not in the moment, but it prompted a conversation with… a friend, I suppose. She felt it prudent to have these things in order. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was. It's frustrating, to be honest. I don’t even remember who suggested it, specifically. Just… a concerned acquaintance.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable. It’s very common for these conversations to arise after a health scare, even a minor one. And it's perfectly normal for details to be a little fuzzy, especially if it was some time ago. We don’t need to pinpoint every single detail right now. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the fall or illness, if you recall anything at all about it?
PATIENT: It was… indoors, I believe. A rather slippery floor, perhaps? Or… no, wait. I recall a feeling of dizziness. A sudden wave of it, and then… nothing. I woke up on the floor, thankfully without any broken bones, but with a rather nasty bump on my head. It wasn’t… dramatic. No hospitalization, just a lot of rest and a friend insisting I “get my affairs in order,” as she put it. The illness… I honestly can’t recall. Perhaps a flu? A bad cold? It feels… distant. It’s all very frustrating. I want to remember, to be able to articulate what happened, but it’s like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fall with some dizziness, a bump on the head, and a possible illness that you can’t quite recall. It sounds like you experienced a period of unsteadiness or a loss of consciousness, even if brief. That’s a good reason for someone to suggest advance care planning. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… I’ve always been… relatively healthy, I believe. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. I see a dentist regularly, and… I suppose I’ve had the occasional cold or flu, as one does. But nothing chronic. Nothing that requires ongoing treatment. I don't have a family doctor, per se. I usually just visit urgent care when needed. It's… rather haphazard, I admit. I should probably be more diligent. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. It's good you've generally been healthy, and it's perfectly alright that you use urgent care when needed. It's not uncommon. Just knowing you haven't had any major illnesses or surgeries is a good starting point. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t believe so. Not currently. Occasionally, I’ll take an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, perhaps ibuprofen, but nothing regularly. And… that’s it, I think. No prescriptions. I avoid medication whenever possible, if I can. I prefer to let things run their course, or try home remedies. It sounds foolish, perhaps, but… I’m not fond of putting things into my body unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. Many people prefer to avoid medication when they can. It’s good to know you’re not currently taking anything. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s another tricky one. I don't think so. Nothing severe, at least. I recall a slight rash once, after eating strawberries as a child, but it wasn’t a full-blown allergic reaction. Just a bit of itching. And… I believe I’m sensitive to certain perfumes, they give me a headache. But nothing life-threatening. No epipen required, thankfully. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. It feels like I’m grasping at straws.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible mild reaction to strawberries in the past and sensitivity to certain perfumes. That's good to know. No known severe allergies. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… difficult. My family is… scattered. I grew up in Mongolia, and haven’t had much contact with them since leaving. I know my mother had… some heart trouble, later in life, but I don’t recall the specifics. And my father… he was a very stoic man. He didn't speak much about his health. I don’t believe there were any other major illnesses in the family, at least not that I’m aware of. It’s not something we discussed much, even when we were together. I’m afraid I can’t be of much help with that, Doctor. It’s all rather hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s understandable that you don’t have a lot of information, given the circumstances. We can work with what you do know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I'm an etcher and engraver. I spend most of my days working in my studio. It's… rather solitary work. I enjoy it immensely, but it does mean I spend a lot of time sitting. I try to take breaks and go for walks when I can, but… it’s not always easy. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, but I confess I have a weakness for sweets. It’s a quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fulfilling, albeit sedentary, lifestyle. It's good that you enjoy your work and prioritize healthy eating, even with a fondness for sweets. Before we discuss the Advance Directive and POLST forms, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline understanding of your current health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, that’s… perfectly alright. I suppose it's sensible. I haven’t had one in quite some time, to be honest. Where shall we begin?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Like this? I’m not sure I’m very good at this. I tend to hold my breath… it’s a habit. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Your heart rate is regular and a little on the slower side, which isn’t necessarily a concern, especially given your lifestyle. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally – that means I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve always been a bit anxious about blood pressure readings… they tend to be a little high when I’m nervous. Is there anything I should be doing to relax? Perhaps focusing on my breathing?
DOCTOR: Focusing on your breathing is a good idea. Just try to relax your arm and take slow, deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. It's likely a bit higher due to your anxiety, as you suspected. We can recheck it later. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say "ahhh."
PATIENT: Ahhhh… Is that alright? I have always had rather small ear canals, so it might be difficult to see anything. Is everything looking normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything looks normal. Your ears are clear, and your throat is slightly pink but doesn’t show any signs of infection. Now, I’ll just check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. And finally, I’ll just palpate your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems to be within normal limits. Your heart and lungs sound good, your reflexes are normal, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that's likely due to anxiety. Overall, you seem to be in good health. Would you like me to document those findings?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. That’s… reassuring to hear. Thank you, Doctor. It’s a comfort to know everything is… functioning as it should. Perhaps my anxiety is to blame for the blood pressure. Now, about those forms… the Advance Directive and POLST, you mentioned? Perhaps we can discuss those, now that you’ve had a chance to assess my… condition.
DOCTOR: Certainly. So, the Advance Directive, also known as a living will, is a document that outlines your wishes for medical care if you were unable to speak for yourself. It covers things like whether or not you want life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube. It only comes into play if you are incapacitated and unable to make your own decisions. The POLST, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a more specific document that translates your wishes into medical orders. It’s typically used by people who have a serious illness or are nearing the end of life. It’s a portable document that can be shared with healthcare providers to ensure your wishes are honored. Do you have any preferences about life-sustaining treatment?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I’ve never really thought about it, to be honest. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. If my quality of life was… severely diminished, I wouldn’t want to prolong my suffering. But… I also wouldn’t want to give up hope prematurely. It’s a delicate balance. I suppose… I would want my doctors to do everything possible to save my life, as long as there was a reasonable chance of recovery. But if it was clear there was no hope, I would want them to focus on keeping me comfortable, rather than prolonging the inevitable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. You want aggressive treatment if there's a chance of recovery, but a focus on comfort care if recovery is unlikely. That’s a very reasonable position to take. We can document those wishes in an Advance Directive. It's a fairly straightforward document, and we can go through it together, section by section, to make sure it accurately reflects your preferences. Would you like to start with that, or would you prefer to learn more about the POLST form first?
PATIENT: Perhaps… the Advance Directive first. It sounds… more comprehensive. And if I understand that thoroughly, the POLST might be easier to grasp. Yes, let’s begin with the Advance Directive. I trust your guidance, Doctor. I’m… a little overwhelmed, to be honest, but I’m grateful for your help in navigating this.
DOCTOR: Certainly. This form has several sections. The first section is about identifying your healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… That’s… complicated. I am divorced, and… I don't have a close family nearby. My friend, the one who suggested these forms… she’s a kind woman, but I wouldn’t want to burden her with such a responsibility. I suppose… I haven’t really designated anyone. I haven’t considered it, to be honest. Perhaps… if there’s no other option, my doctor could act as my proxy? I trust your judgment, Doctor, and I believe you would advocate for my best interests. Is that permissible?
DOCTOR: That’s a valid question. In most states, a physician can act as a healthcare proxy if you don't have anyone else designated. However, there are some potential conflicts of interest, and it's generally preferable to have someone who is not directly involved in your medical care. We can leave that section blank for now, and you can think about it. If you can’t identify anyone, we can discuss the legal implications of having your physician act as your proxy. Let’s move on to the next section, which outlines your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. It asks about things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Are you comfortable discussing those topics?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. It’s… unpleasant, but necessary. I would rather face these difficult questions now, than leave them to be decided by others later. Please, proceed. I’m ready to discuss the options, however uncomfortable they may be.
DOCTOR: Alright. The first question asks about mechanical ventilation – that’s using a machine to help you breathe if you’re unable to do so on your own. Do you want to receive mechanical ventilation if it’s determined that it’s the only way to keep you alive?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult one. If there was a reasonable chance of recovery, then yes, I would want to receive mechanical ventilation. But if it was clear there was no hope, and it would only prolong my suffering… then no. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially in that situation. I suppose… the key phrase is “reasonable chance of recovery.” That’s what’s important. If there’s no hope, I would want to focus on comfort care, rather than prolonging the inevitable. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very clear. You want mechanical ventilation if there's a reasonable chance of recovery, but not if it's only prolonging suffering. We can document that specifically. The form also asks about artificial nutrition and hydration – that’s providing nutrients and fluids through a feeding tube or IV. Do you have any preferences about receiving artificial nutrition and hydration?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition and hydration… That’s… less clear to me. If I was able to eat and drink on my own, then of course I would want to do so. But if I was unable to, and it was determined that it would only prolong my suffering… then I suppose I would be open to refusing it. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery, even if it meant I wasn’t receiving nutrients or fluids. I suppose… quality of life is more important than simply prolonging my existence. Is that understandable? I realize I'm being rather vague. It’s just… a difficult topic.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It is a difficult topic, and you’re articulating your wishes very clearly. You want to receive nutrition and hydration if you’re able to, but you’re willing to refuse it if it’s only prolonging suffering and there’s no hope of recovery. We can document that specifically. Now, let’s talk about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR – that’s performing chest compressions and providing artificial respiration if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. Do you have any preferences about receiving CPR?
PATIENT: CPR… That’s… the most difficult one, I think. I’ve seen it in films, and it looks… traumatic. If there was a reasonable chance of recovery, then yes, I would want to receive CPR. But if it was clear there was no hope, and it would only prolong my suffering… then no. I wouldn't want to be subjected to that trauma, and I wouldn't want my doctors to feel obligated to perform it if it was futile. I suppose… I would rather pass away peacefully, surrounded by comfort and dignity, than be subjected to aggressive interventions that would only prolong my suffering. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. You want CPR if there's a reasonable chance of recovery, but not if it's only prolonging suffering and there's no hope of recovery. You want to pass away peacefully and with dignity. We’ve now covered the main sections of the Advance Directive. We can document your wishes regarding mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and CPR. We also need to add your signature and the signature of a witness. Would you like me to print out the document so you can review it, and then sign it?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. I would like to review it carefully, to make sure everything is documented accurately. And then, I will sign it. It’s… a weight off my shoulders, to finally be addressing these difficult questions. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your guidance and patience throughout this process.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure to help you through this process. It's a brave thing to do, to think about these difficult questions and make your wishes known. Here’s the document. Take your time reviewing it. If you have any questions or want to make any changes, just let me know. Once you’re satisfied, you’ll need to sign it, and we’ll need a witness present to sign as well. I'll give you a moment of privacy now. Please don’t hesitate to call me if you need anything.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. .
