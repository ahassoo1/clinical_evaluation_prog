DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr… Pipkorn, was it? Yes, well, it’s my ears, you see. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Things are a bit muffled, like talking underwater, almost. Not all the time, mind you, just… sometimes. It’s hard to explain. I worked with those shoe machines for… oh, goodness, a long time. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you been noticing this muffled hearing, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a few years? It comes and goes, you see. It's not like it happened all at once. One day I’d be hearing fine, the next… not so much. It’s hard to put a date on it, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Schneer. It’s quite common for these things to develop gradually. And you mentioned working with shoe machines. Could you describe the nature of that work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the machines! Well, they were big, noisy things. Lots of hammering and… whirring. I used to operate ‘em, you see. Feed the leather in, make sure everything was running smooth. Had to wear earplugs sometimes, but… well, I didn't always, if I'm being honest. It was a busy place, and they weren't always the most comfortable. Is that important? It was a long time ago, though. A very long time.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Schneer. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can certainly affect one’s hearing. Now, aside from the muffled hearing, have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think. Sometimes… yes, I think I do hear a sort of… tinnitus, is that what they call it? A high-pitched sound, like… a kettle whistling, but quieter. Not constant, mind you. Mostly when it's very quiet. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain these things. It’s just a little… buzz in my ear, now and again.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Mr. Schneer. Tinnitus is quite common. Now, let’s move on to a more general question. Have you experienced any dizziness, or balance problems recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness… not really, no. Well, not any more than you'd expect for an old fella like me. I get a bit wobbly sometimes, but I think that's just my legs. And I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be, naturally. But nothing that would make me fall or anything. No spinning or anything like that. Does that answer your question? It’s funny, I used to be quite the dancer, you know. A very good dancer. But that was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any pain in or around your ears?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not any pain. Just… a bit of fullness sometimes, like something's blocking them. And… well, a bit of itchiness now and then. Nothing terrible, mind you. I don’t go sticking anything in my ears, if that’s what you're wondering. My mother always told me to leave well enough alone. And she was a very wise woman, my mother. Always told me to eat my vegetables, too. Still, no pain, really. Just… uncomfortable sometimes.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to perform a brief examination of your ears, just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you need to do. My ears? Go right ahead. I haven’t had anyone look at them in… goodness, I don’t even remember. Just be gentle, alright? They’re a bit sensitive, you know. And don’t be alarmed if they're a bit… dusty. I haven’t been cleaning them as much lately. Old age, you know. Everything starts to go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, let’s take a look… Hmm. I see some wax buildup in your ear canal, and the eardrum appears slightly red. The same on this side. Some wax and redness. It’s not severe, but it could be contributing to your symptoms. I also notice some mild swelling of the ear canal. Do you have any allergies to ear drops, or any medical conditions that would prevent me from using them?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had much trouble with allergies. I suppose I could be allergic to something, but I haven't discovered it yet. Medical conditions… well, I've got a bit of arthritis, mostly in my hands. And my knees aren't what they used to be, as I mentioned. But nothing that would stop me from using ear drops, I don’t think. Are these drops something you put in my ears? I always worry about things going in my ears. My mother, again, always warned me about that. But if you think it'll help… I trust your judgement, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. No known allergies, mild arthritis. It's good to know. These are ear drops, yes, but they are a simple cerumenolytic – meaning they soften the wax, making it easier to remove. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. I’m going to prescribe a course of drops to use at home for one week. If the wax doesn't soften enough, we can consider a professional cleaning. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Ear drops… for a week, you say? Yes, that sounds alright, dear. As long as it’s not too complicated. I'm not very good with complicated instructions, you know. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. Could you write it down for me? Just so I’m sure I get it right. And how often do I need to put them in? Twice a day? Once a day? I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be a bother. It’s just… I get so confused sometimes. A note would be wonderful, if you don’t mind. Thank you, dear. You’re a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. Here you are. One week of drops, twice a day. It’s quite straightforward. And you are not a bother at all. “Instill 2 drops into each ear twice daily for 7 days.” Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: "Instill… two drops…" Yes, I think I see it. Twice a day… alright. Seven days… Yes, that seems manageable. No, I don’t think so. No questions, dear. You’ve explained it very clearly. I appreciate you writing it down. It helps a lot. What happens after seven days? Do I come back to see you? Or do I just… keep using the drops? I’m sorry, I’m always worrying about forgetting something. My daughter always tells me I need to make a list. But I always lose the list! Still, thank you again, dear. You’re a very patient doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Schneer. After seven days, if your symptoms haven't improved, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We can then discuss further options, such as a professional ear cleaning. I’ll write a note for you to remind you. Here you go. And don’t worry about forgetting; that's perfectly understandable. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
