DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see... well, it's this ear trouble, I suppose. It comes and goes, you know? And I get so dizzy with it. My daughter, she insisted I come. Said with my family... well, there's been a bit of this happening before. Honestly, I don't remember all the details very well. It's just... a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettling is a good way to describe it. Let's try to get some more details so we can figure out what’s going on. You mentioned it comes and goes – how long has this been happening overall?
PATIENT: Oh dear... how long now? That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a while. Maybe a few months? But it's hard to say for sure. There are times I don’t notice it at all, then suddenly… whoosh. It comes back. And it’s not always the same, you know? Sometimes it's just a fullness in my ear, other times… well, the spinning. It really throws me off. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so pinning down a date… I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll work through it. So, a few months of intermittent ear fullness and dizziness. When the dizziness happens, how long does an episode typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness… Hmm. It varies, really. Sometimes just a few minutes, enough to make me grab onto something. Other times… it feels like hours. It’s hard to tell time when you’re feeling so off-balance. I mostly just lie down and try to sleep it off. My daughter says I should really pay attention to how long it lasts, but honestly, when it's happening, I'm just trying to get through it! It’s a bit of a blur, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. It sounds quite disruptive. And you mentioned lying down helps?
PATIENT: Yes, lying down definitely helps. It's the only thing that really does, to be honest. Makes the spinning… less spinny, if that makes sense. And it takes the pressure off, a little. I try to stay still, too. Moving around just makes it worse, I find. It's a bit of a bother, having to be so careful all the time. I used to be so active, you know? Now… well, I prefer staying put when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down alleviates the symptoms. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… oh dear, that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. It just seems to come on randomly. Sometimes after I’ve been out shopping, maybe? But I go shopping all the time, and it doesn’t happen every time. And sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting quietly at home. I really wish I could tell you something concrete, but it's just… unpredictable. I'm sorry I can’t be more useful. Is this frustrating for you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s not uncommon for these things to be difficult to pinpoint. We'll take our time. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or any nausea or vomiting when these episodes occur?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the hearing! That comes and goes too, you know? Sometimes my ear feels muffled, like there's cotton wool in it. It usually goes away when the dizziness does, but it's a bit worrying. And… hmm, I think I do get a bit queasy sometimes, a little bit of nausea. I haven’t actually vomited, thankfully, but I feel like I might. Ringing… now that you mention it, maybe a little bit, a very faint ringing. It’s hard to say if it's just the quiet, you know? I live alone now, and sometimes the silence is… well, it's loud, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent hearing loss, occasional nausea with the dizziness, and a faint ringing in your ears. Now, let’s go through some other things. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had a bit of a cold a few weeks back, maybe a month ago? Nothing too bad, just a sniffle and a cough. It didn’t last long, just a few days. But it felt like it lingered a bit, you know? I wasn't quite myself for a week or so after, a little tired and achy. But nothing major, really. I just rested and took some over-the-counter medicine. Would that be relevant, Doctor? I'm trying to remember everything... It's just hard, you know?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Ms. Mayhugh. We're just trying to build a complete picture. Now, do you have any history of allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I've never really had any trouble with hay fever or anything like that. I used to garden a lot, and I didn't have any reactions to any of the plants. My daughter asks me if I’m allergic to any medications, but I haven't taken much in the way of prescriptions over the years. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, that sort of thing. Is that helpful, Doctor? I'm just trying to think... It all feels a bit blurry, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or significant medication history. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical background. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking… Let me see. My husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure. But I don’t think I do. The doctor used to check it when I went for my yearly check-ups, and it was always fine. And diabetes… no, not that I know of. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables. My daughter worries about me, of course. She’s always telling me to watch my sugar. Honestly, it's all a bit of a jumble. Is it alright if I just tell you what medications I’m currently taking? That might be easier. I don’t want to leave anything out, but my memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Let’s start with your medications. What are you currently taking, and what are they for?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let me see… There’s just the one, really. It’s for my arthritis, you know, in my hands. It’s called… um… Oh dear, the name escapes me. It’s a little white pill. I take one every morning. And… well, that’s it. I’m on Medicare, so they keep a list of everything, I suppose. I haven’t had to worry about prescriptions much over the years. Honestly, I mostly just rely on a good cup of tea and a bit of rest when I’m feeling unwell. Is that helpful, Doctor? I feel terrible that I can't remember the name of the medication...
DOCTOR: Okay, one medication for arthritis – a little white pill taken daily. We can look that up in your records. Let me just pull up your medication list here… Ah, yes. You’re taking naproxen 500mg daily for osteoarthritis. That's good. Now, let's move on to your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago. And… oh! And I had a hysterectomy, years and years ago. I don’t remember the exact year, but it was after my daughter was born. It was a fairly routine procedure, I think. Nothing major, really. Other than that… I don’t believe I’ve ever had any other surgeries. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, so I’ve avoided them if I could! Is that alright, Doctor? I'm trying my best to recall everything... It's just a bit of a strain, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a hysterectomy after your daughter was born. And now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… . That’s a tricky one. My mother, she had… well, she had heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much. And my father, he had a bit of a problem with his balance in his later years, something like… vertigo, perhaps? But I’m not sure. My brother, he’s still alive, but he lives on another island, and we don’t see each other very often. I don't really know what medical problems he has, to be honest. My daughter always asks about this, but it’s hard to say for sure. We didn’t really talk about these things much growing up, you know? It’s all a bit… vague. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful, Doctor. I really wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and possible vertigo. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to smoke a little, but he gave it up years ago. And alcohol… well, I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's about it. Nothing regular. I prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest. It’s much more soothing. And I live alone now, you see, so there’s no one to drink with. I keep myself busy with gardening and… well, trying to remember things! Is that alright, Doctor? I'm trying my best to answer all your questions, but my mind is a bit of a fog sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very occasional alcohol. Now, just one final question regarding your history. Have you experienced any recent head trauma, changes in vision, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh dear, head trauma... No, thankfully not. I haven't had any falls or bumps to the head that I can remember. My vision... well, it's not what it used to be, of course. I need glasses for reading, and things are a bit blurry up close. But I don't think it's changed recently. As for the hearing loss... well, we've already talked about that, haven't we? It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes my ear feels muffled, but it usually comes back. No, I haven't experienced any sudden or permanent hearing loss. I think that's everything, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a bit tired now. All this thinking… it's quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, that was very helpful. Thank you for being so thorough. So, to summarize, you're a 59-year-old female presenting with intermittent ear fullness and dizziness, sometimes accompanied by nausea and fluctuating hearing loss. You take naproxen for arthritis, and have a history of tonsillectomy and hysterectomy. You deny any recent head trauma, and there's a possible family history of heart trouble and vertigo. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll start by checking your ears, nose, and throat, then listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment, including balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My daughter always tells me to listen to the doctor, you see. I just hope you can figure out what’s going on. I'm a bit worried, honestly. It’s just… unsettling, you know? But yes, please, go ahead with the exam. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, I'm going to take a look inside your ears now. This might be a little chilly. Alright. I’m not seeing any signs of infection or fluid buildup in either ear. The ear canals are clear, and the eardrums look intact. Now, I’m going to take a look at your nose and throat. Say “Ah” for me, please. Your throat looks clear as well. No signs of redness or swelling. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, last part of the exam. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. . Just let me know if anything feels strange. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, you know? . Is this alright? I hope I’m not being a bother. It's a little difficult, you see, getting up and down these days... .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, just take your time. Alright, can you close your eyes and just stand like this for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: . Oh dear... This is a bit… precarious. I'm trying to stay still, Doctor, but it's a little difficult. I feel a bit… off-balance. . Is this what you’re looking for? It’s always been a bit of a challenge, you see, keeping my balance. Even when I was younger… I wasn’t very steady on my feet. . I hope I'm not making a mess of things...
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, you can open your eyes now. Alright. I noticed a slight sway while you had your eyes closed. Now, could you please walk a few steps forward for me?
PATIENT: . Oh dear, it’s a bit wobbly, isn’t it? I'm trying to walk straight, but it’s a little difficult to coordinate. It feels like I’m… floating a little bit. . Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I'm not being a nuisance. My daughter always tells me I need to be more careful... I just don’t want to fall. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, thank you. You can sit down now. Alright. Based on the exam, I’m not seeing any obvious signs of infection or neurological problems. The slight sway while walking and closing your eyes suggests a possible balance issue. It’s likely related to what you're describing with the dizziness. Now, given your history and the exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV for short. It's a common condition where small crystals in your inner ear become dislodged, causing brief episodes of dizziness with certain head movements. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Benign… something… vertigo? . Crystals in my ear? I… I don’t think so. It just feels like the room is spinning, you know? And sometimes I feel nauseous. It comes and goes, like waves. I haven’t noticed anything specific triggering it, no particular head movement. Honestly, it all sounds very complicated. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need surgery? My daughter always worries so much about me, you see. I don’t want to frighten her. . Is there anything I can do to make it stop?
DOCTOR: No, it's not usually serious, Ms. Mayhugh. BPPV isn't life-threatening. And fortunately, it’s often treatable with a simple maneuver called the Epley maneuver. It involves a series of head positions that help reposition the crystals in your inner ear. It's usually done in the office, and it’s often very effective. Surgery is rarely needed. The fact that you haven't noticed specific triggers is common. Sometimes it’s spontaneous. Before we proceed with the maneuver, I'd like to order a Dix-Hallpike test to confirm the diagnosis. It's a simple test that involves quickly changing your head position to see if it provokes the dizziness. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, a test… another test? . Well, if it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes, I suppose so. I just hope it doesn’t make me too dizzy. I don’t want to fall. And what is this… Epley maneuver you mentioned? Does it hurt? My daughter always says I should ask lots of questions, so I’m trying to remember everything she told me. Is it a long procedure? I’m just a little nervous, you see. I haven't been feeling very well lately, and all these tests… it’s a bit overwhelming. . Is there anything I should do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s good you're asking questions. The Dix-Hallpike test is very quick and doesn't usually cause any lasting discomfort. It involves quickly moving you from a sitting to a lying position while turning your head. It will help us identify which ear is affected. The Epley maneuver is also very quick, usually takes just a few minutes. It involves a series of head positions, guided by me. It might cause some temporary dizziness or nausea, but it's usually well-tolerated. It doesn’t hurt. No special preparation is needed. Just come as you are. Before we do the test, I want to rule out other potential causes of dizziness, just to be safe. I'd like to order a basic blood test to check your blood count and rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I'll also check your hearing to see if there's any associated hearing loss. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests… blood tests and hearing tests… . Well, if it's to be sure, then yes, I suppose so. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a bit of a doctor's appointment next week as well, and I don't want to overdo it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed. My daughter is going to be so worried when I tell her about all this. Is there anything I can do to feel a little better in the meantime? Perhaps some tea? Or a lie-down? I just feel a bit… shaky. And is this something I should be concerned about? Is it something serious, like a stroke? My neighbor’s husband had a stroke last year, and I don’t want to end up like him. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed with so many tests. And I absolutely want to address your worry about a stroke. Based on your symptoms and the exam, a stroke is unlikely. The dizziness you're describing is more consistent with BPPV, and the neurological exam was normal. But the tests are to be certain and rule out other possibilities. To feel better in the meantime, a lie-down is a very good idea. Staying hydrated is also helpful. And, yes, a cup of tea can be soothing. Let’s focus on getting through these tests one step at a time. I'll explain everything clearly as we go. I'll order the blood test and hearing test now, and then we can discuss scheduling them. After we have the results, we'll decide on the next steps. For now, let’s just take a deep breath. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions, no matter how small. I'm here to help you feel better. Would you like me to have a nurse bring you a glass of water and a blanket while we talk about scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be very kind, Doctor. A glass of water and a blanket… that sounds lovely. Thank you. . You're very patient with me, you know. My daughter always tells me I ask too many questions. But I just like to understand everything. . Yes, please, let's talk about scheduling the tests. I suppose the sooner it's done, the sooner I'll know what's going on. And perhaps a cup of tea afterwards? . I just feel a little… anxious. It’s just all a bit much, you know? But thank you for being so kind and understanding. . I feel a little better just talking to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It's my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. I’ll have the nurse bring you a glass of water and a blanket right away. And we can definitely talk about getting you a cup of tea afterwards. "Nurse, could you please bring a glass of water and a blanket for Ms. Mayhugh, and see if she'd like a cup of tea?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you so much, Doctor. You're very kind. . A cup of tea would be lovely. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, you know. It always makes me feel a little better. . Yes, a cup of tea would be wonderful. Thank you again. . I think I’m starting to feel a little calmer now. But I’m still a little worried about the tests. I just hope they don’t take too long. And I hope they don’t find anything serious. . But thank you for being so patient and understanding. . Perhaps we could talk about my daughter afterwards? She worries so much about me, you know. I just want her to be happy. . But thank you again. . I think I’m starting to feel a little better now. But I’m still a little worried. . But thank you again. .
DOCTOR: .
