DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. Just a pain. It’s been bothering me. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore throat. I understand you're short on time, I'll try to be as efficient as possible. But to get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More? Honestly, it just hurts when I swallow. It feels… rough. Like sandpaper, maybe? I don't know. It’s not a bad bad pain, just… annoying. Is that helpful? I really need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. “Rough” and like sandpaper is a good way to describe it. And you said it hurts when you swallow. Is it painful to talk?
PATIENT: Well… no, not really. Talking is fine. It just feels… off, when I swallow. Like something is stuck. Honestly, I don't understand why I need to explain everything so much. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions, but it helps me to narrow down the possible causes. It’s good to know talking isn’t painful. When did this sore throat start?
PATIENT: Ugh. Dates… Honestly? I don't really… keep track. A few days ago, maybe? Last week? It all blurs together. It wasn't sudden, it just… was. I’ve been busy. Very busy. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a few days to a week. No sudden onset, it just gradually started. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose with it?
PATIENT: Fever? I… don’t think so. I haven't felt sick, just this throat. No cough. No runny nose. Look, Doctor, I work with machines all day. It’s dusty. Maybe it’s just… dust? I’m a practical woman. I don't need a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: Dust is definitely a possibility. Let's take a quick look at your throat, just to get a visual. It won’t take long. Open wide and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Honestly. Fine. Ahhhh. Get it over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is a little red, but it doesn’t look severely inflamed. I don't see any white spots or pus, which is good. Your tonsils don’t appear swollen. Have you been having any difficulty breathing or swallowing fluids?
PATIENT: No difficulty breathing. And no, swallowing fluids is fine. Just… uncomfortable, like I said. It’s not like I can’t drink, Doctor. I drink plenty of water. It’s just… irritating. Honestly, I think it's just a minor irritation. I really don’t see why I’m here. It’s wasting my time, and yours.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. It's good that you're able to swallow fluids without difficulty. Given your symptoms and the exam, it does sound like a mild irritation, possibly from dust exposure, as you suspected. However, I want to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Honestly, I haven't needed many. No, I don't think so. I've taken some pain relievers in the past, but nothing serious. No reactions, as far as I remember. I don't make a habit of paying attention to those things. I just take them when I need to and move on.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Since it sounds like a mild irritation, I’m going to recommend some supportive care. I suggest drinking plenty of fluids, like you’re already doing, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the discomfort. Throat lozenges or warm salt water gargles can also be helpful.
PATIENT: Fine. Pain relievers, lozenges… Honestly, that's what I was hoping for. I can manage that. No need for anything drastic, right? I really need to get back to work. Is there anything else? I have a machine to get running. A very important machine.
DOCTOR: No, nothing else at this time. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing, please come back or see another doctor immediately. It's important to rule out anything more serious. Here's a handout with the recommendations we discussed. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. No questions. I understand. Fluids, pain relievers. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I really must be going now. I appreciate your time.
