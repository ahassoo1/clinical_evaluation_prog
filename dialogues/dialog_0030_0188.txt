DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, okay. So, my pee... it's orange. It started maybe two days ago. Not all the time, but... yeah. Orange. I don't know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Secondi. Orange urine is certainly something we should investigate. To start, can you describe the orange color a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Like... not light orange. More like... the color of a carrot? Or maybe a dark orange juice? It's not clear, it's... a bit cloudy, I think. It’s hard to explain. It’s not red, definitely not. Just... orange. I've never seen it like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful. And you said this started about two days ago. Have you noticed any other changes in your urine—like increased frequency, burning when you urinate, or any unusual odor?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Same as always, how much I go. No pain. No bad smell, I don’t think. Just the color. I drink a lot of water, usually. Maybe two, three liters a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all—like fatigue, changes in your appetite, nausea, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I feel okay, actually. A little tired maybe, but I work long hours. I eat normal, I guess. No stomach pain, nothing like that. Everything else is… fine. I just got worried about the pee. It's not normal, right?
DOCTOR: No, it's good you brought it to my attention. It’s not typical to have orange urine, and we want to figure out why. Let's go through some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. Nothing serious. No, no big problems. I get a yearly check-up with my regular doctor, but everything is always good. I take a vitamin, a multi-vitamin, every day. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, the multivitamin is important, thank you for mentioning that. We'll talk about that shortly. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Not even when I broke my arm! Just a cast for a few weeks. I don’t like hospitals, so I try to stay healthy, you know? No surgery for me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family—do any of your close relatives have a history of kidney problems, liver problems, or any unusual urine-related issues?
PATIENT: Um… that's a good question. My father, he has high blood pressure. And my mother, she has… diabetes, I think. But I don’t know about kidney or liver. No one ever talks about pee in my family, if you know what I mean. It's just not a topic. No one ever says anything about problems with… with that. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Secondi. It’s not a common topic of conversation! Thank you for sharing what you do know. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a technician. Mostly outdoors, fixing things, building things. So I'm active, I guess. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes it’s hard when you're working. I don't smoke. I drink some coffee, maybe two cups a day. I don’t drink alcohol, not usually. Just… a normal life, I think. I come home, I eat dinner with my wife, I watch some television. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. Nothing I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can take most things. My wife always checks before I take anything new, just to be safe, but I've never had a problem. No allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's talk about your current medications again, just to be precise. You mentioned a multivitamin. Can you tell me the brand and approximately how much you take each day?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, the vitamin. It's… Centrum. I think. The blue bottle. Just one pill every morning with my breakfast. It has, uh… lots of things in it. Vitamin C, Vitamin D, all the usual things. It's a regular multivitamin, you can buy it at the store. It's not anything special. I’ve been taking it for a few years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll just check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I'll listen to your abdomen and take a quick look at your skin. And I will need a urine sample, if you are able to provide one.
PATIENT: Yes, okay, that's fine. Sounds good. I understand. I can do that. Let me… where do I go? Is there a bathroom here? A private one? I can give a sample, no problem. Just tell me where.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. There’s a restroom just down the hall to your left. I'll leave a sterile cup there for you. Please try to collect a midstream sample—that means you start urinating for a few seconds, then collect the sample mid-flow, and finish urinating after that. I’ll also get prepared to listen to your abdomen after you return.
PATIENT: Okay, a midstream sample. Right. I think I remember my doctor telling me about that. Okay, I’ll go now. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Secondi. Take your time. I’ll be here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I think I got it right. Midstream, like you said.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Secondi. Now, if you'll just lie down on the exam table, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Is there anything I need to do? Should I move my legs? Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I'm a bit nervous, if you don’t mind me saying. Is it bad? The orange pee?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be nervous, Mr. Secondi. I'm just trying to gather some information. No, you don't need to do anything special – just lie still and breathe normally. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It helps me check for any abnormalities. The orange urine can be caused by a number of things, most of which are not serious. It's important to rule out anything concerning, and that's what we're doing. …Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual sounds. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. No pain... no, that's okay. A little bit firm, maybe, but no pain. I get a bit bloated sometimes, after I eat. But no pain, Doctor. Really. Just… a normal belly, I think. I ate a big dinner last night. That’s probably it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Your abdomen feels normal – no tenderness or masses. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your skin. No jaundice noted, skin appears normal in color and texture. Okay, Mr. Secondi, you can sit up now. We've completed the physical exam. We’ll wait for the lab results on your urine sample. The results typically take 24-48 hours.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. 24-48 hours... I can wait. I appreciate you checking everything. So… you think it's probably nothing serious? Just… something I ate? Or the vitamin?
DOCTOR: It’s quite possible it’s something benign, Mr. Secondi – like dietary factors or the multivitamin. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities with the lab tests. We’ll check for things like dehydration, liver function, and signs of a urinary tract infection. While we wait for the results, I would recommend increasing your fluid intake even further—aim for at least three liters of water a day—and temporarily discontinue the multivitamin to see if that makes a difference. If you develop any new symptoms—like fever, back pain, or changes in bowel movements—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Three liters… and stop the vitamin. I can do that. No new symptoms… I will remember. Stop the vitamin and watch for anything. Yes, I think… just one question. Will the lab tests… will they hurt? Will they need to take a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Secondi. No, the urine tests won't hurt at all – it’s just a simple analysis of your sample. And no, we won’t need to take any blood. We're starting with the urine sample, and if the results indicate further investigation is needed, we can discuss the options at that time. For now, let’s focus on increasing your fluids and stopping the vitamin. We’ll get the lab results back within 48 hours and go from there. Do you have any other concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you for checking me out, and explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now. Just three liters and no vitamin. I can do that. I appreciate your time. I'll wait for the results. And I'll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Secondi. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or if anything changes. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
