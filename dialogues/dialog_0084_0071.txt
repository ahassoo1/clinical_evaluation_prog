DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I reckon. My daughter… she’s trying to get her husband settled here, you see. He’s from over seas, and they said he needs some papers from a doctor about what vaccinations he needs for his visa. I hope that makes sense. It's a little confusing, all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Skarbek. We do this fairly often. So, he needs documentation of vaccinations for visa purposes. Okay. Do you know what specific vaccinations they're requesting, or do we need to figure that out based on where he’s coming from?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I… honestly, I don’t. The papers just said “required vaccinations” and had a checklist. They didn't list anything specific. He’s from… let me think… Nigeria, I believe. A small village outside of Lagos. Would that help you know what he might need? I’m not very good with geography, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Skarbek. Nigeria is helpful information. Okay, based on his origin and current visa requirements, he’ll likely need documentation of measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, and potentially hepatitis B and influenza. Have you or he already started any of these vaccinations, or do we need to start from scratch?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That’s a lot of names! I don’t believe he’s had any of those here. He didn't come with me when I moved, so I don't know his history. We’d be starting from scratch, I suppose. Is that… alright? Will it take a long time? He’s starting a new job soon, and I don’t want to delay things too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting from scratch is fine. It will require a series of vaccinations, so it won't be a one-time visit. We can do a few at a time to minimize side effects. Let’s start with tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – that's a combination shot we can give today. Before we do that, though, I need to ask a few questions about his medical history, if you don’t mind. Any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe he has any allergies that I know of. He’s always been a strong, healthy man. He grew up on a farm, mostly eating what he grew himself. I’ll have to ask him when he gets here, just to be sure. He’s a bit shy, so I’ll need to help him remember everything he's had before, if anything. Is it alright if I bring him in next week? Would that be soon enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, next week is perfectly fine. It’s good you’ll be there to help him. And that's helpful to know he's generally healthy. While we wait for him, let’s quickly go over your medical history, just as a standard precaution before administering any vaccines. Any chronic medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a bit older, so I have the usual aches and pains. Arthritis in my hands, mostly. Nothing too serious, though. I take some over-the-counter medicine for it, that’s all. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. My doctor back home always said I was a tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and a gallbladder removal, noted. Any surgeries other than the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but it healed up just fine on its own. It didn't need surgery, thankfully. My mama always said I was too adventurous for my own good.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, besides the arthritis medicine?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis medicine, Doctor. It's called… let me see… Ibuprofen. And sometimes, when it’s really bad, I’ll take acetaminophen. Nothing else, I promise. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken a lot of different things over the years for colds and headaches, and I haven’t had any problems. My mama always said I had a strong constitution, which I suppose is a good thing. Though… I did get a rash once when I was a child, after eating strawberries. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t eat strawberries anymore, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood rash with strawberries, noted. That’s good to know, even if it was a long time ago. Now, just a couple more questions about your medical history before we move on. Do you have any family history of serious medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mama lived to be 92, and she was as healthy as a horse until the very end. She didn't have any serious illnesses, thankfully. My papa… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older, I believe. He didn’t go to the doctor much, so I don’t know all the details. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he passed away several years ago. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and diabetes. I’m sorry to hear about your brother. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, ma'am. Not at all. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink of alcohol in over forty years. And definitely no recreational drugs. I was raised better than that. I always said a clear head and a strong back were the most important things a person could have.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. So, to summarize, you have arthritis, a history of gallbladder removal, no known allergies, a family history of heart disease and diabetes, and you don’t smoke, drink, or use drugs. Is that all accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That sounds about right. You’ve got a good memory! It’s nice to know someone is listening. It makes me feel better, knowing you’ve got all the information.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Skarbek. Okay, so we can proceed with giving your tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis shot today. Before we do, I just want to quickly examine you – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything looks good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds perfectly fine. I don't mind a bit. I always figured a little check-up couldn't hurt. My mama always said prevention was better than cure, and she was a wise woman. Just let me know if it's going to be cold! My skin is a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not overly concerning for your age. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. No murmurs or wheezing. Everything sounds good so far. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I always try to take good care of myself, even if I am getting older. I drink plenty of water and try to stay out of the cold as much as possible. Though, living in this part of the country, that's not always easy!
DOCTOR: Ears look clear, throat is normal. No signs of infection. Okay, everything looks good. We can go ahead and give you the shot now. It might feel a little pinch, but it should be over quickly. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A pinch, you say? Well, I suppose I can handle a little pinch. I reckon my left arm is fine, Doctor. It doesn’t bother me as much as my right one. I pulled a muscle in it a few years back, lifting some heavy boxes for my granddaughter.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. You might feel a little soreness at the injection site for a day or two, but that’s normal. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you need to. Any questions so far?
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be! Just a little sting, like you said. No, I don't think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. It’s a relief to know what to expect. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s nice to feel like someone is actually listening to me.
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could help, Mr. Skarbek. So, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to get the next round of vaccinations. And please bring your daughter’s husband with you then, so we can get his vaccination history. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds perfect. I'll make sure he comes with me. He's a bit shy, as I mentioned, so I’ll have to encourage him. But he’s a good boy, and he knows this is important. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll be sure to tell my daughter what a wonderful doctor you are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. We look forward to seeing both of you then. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I believe that's everything. You've been a great help. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and explain everything so clearly. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. And have a good day. I suppose I'll be on my way now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a good day as well, and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment.
