DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr. Pfennig, is it? Yes, well, I just moved here, you see. New to the area. And one has to… establish a doctor, doesn’t one? It's all quite tiresome, really. I suppose this is a social call of sorts. Medicare insisted. Do get on with it, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. Establishing care is important, and Medicare is quite right to encourage that. I appreciate you coming in. While it's good to get a general baseline, even with no specific concerns, it is helpful to have a little more information to start with. So, let’s start with a quick check-in. Are you currently experiencing any health problems, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Health problems? Goodness. At my age? Where do you begin? I suppose… my knees ache a bit. They always have, really. And sometimes, I feel a little… out of sorts. But that could be the weather. Honestly, I don’t see what this has to do with anything. Are you going to poke and prod me? I really dislike being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Candice. We'll take things at your pace, and I’ll certainly minimize any poking and prodding. It’s good to know about the knees and feeling "out of sorts," though. Those are good places to start. When you say your knees ache, is that a constant ache, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly goes, thankfully. But when I stand for too long, or… well, attempt to stand for too long, it reminds me it’s there. It’s just… old age, I presume. My husband says I should be more active, but honestly, the thought is exhausting. Is this really necessary? It feels like a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. It is important to determine if it’s simply age-related wear and tear, or if there's something else going on that could be addressed. Even small changes can make a big difference. To clarify, when you say "attempt to stand for too long," about how long is that, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Five minutes, perhaps? Ten, if I’m really trying. It’s not that bad, you know. I get by. I have a perfectly good chair at home, and my husband is always offering to… assist. Honestly, I don’t see what all the questions are for. It's just my knees. Everyone’s knees ache when they get to my age. Is there a point to this, or are we simply cataloging the inevitable decline of the human body?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Candice. You’re right to ask about the point of all this. We’re trying to get a complete picture to ensure there isn’t something more going on that could be helped, even with something as common as knee pain. It's good to rule things out. Besides the knees and feeling generally "out of sorts," have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? At my age, everything is a change! My memory isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. Though that’s hardly news. And I get… flustered easily. Little things. But I’m sure it's just… the stress of moving. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite annoyed. My husband handles all the important things, you see. I just… exist. Is this all there is to this visit? A litany of complaints about an aging woman?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice, and I apologize if I’m making you feel like I’m simply cataloging complaints. That’s certainly not my intention. It's helpful for me to understand how things are affecting you, and even small details can provide important clues. The memory changes and feeling flustered are good to note. Have you noticed any difficulty with things like remembering names, dates, or recent events?
PATIENT: Oh, names, absolutely. Dates… who keeps track of dates? And recent events… well, yesterday is a bit hazy, to be frank. It's just… a general fog, you see. My husband says I repeat myself, but honestly, what does he expect? He’s always going on about my “cognitive function.” It's dreadfully condescending. I really don’t see what this has to do with my knees. Can we please move on? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to move on, Candice. It’s good to get a complete picture, though, and memory changes can sometimes be related to other underlying issues, even if it's just to rule things out. Okay, let's shift gears then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My husband handles all of that, you see. He's very particular about my… regimen. I believe I take something for my blood pressure. And a little white pill for… something. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. He gives me a little tray every morning, and I take what he provides. It's much easier that way. I really don't bother with the details. It's all rather… overwhelming. Can we just say "a few pills"? It's probably best. I'm getting quite tired now. Is this nearly over?
DOCTOR: “A few pills” is helpful to know, Candice. Since your husband manages your medications, perhaps we can ask him for a list later. It’s important to have accurate information for safety. One last quick question, and then we can move on to a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I've eaten everything my husband has put in front of me for seventy years, and I’m still here, aren’t I? Though I do get a bit… itchy sometimes. But that’s probably the weather. Honestly, this is all very tedious. I suppose a quick poke and prod is better than endless questioning. But please, be gentle. And do get on with it. I have a luncheon, you know. And frankly, I'm beginning to feel quite faint. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. We'll keep things brief and gentle. I'll just take a quick look at your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a peek at your knees. It shouldn’t take long. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/85. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at those knees… There’s some tenderness on the inner aspect of both knees, and a slight range of motion limitation, but no significant swelling or redness.
