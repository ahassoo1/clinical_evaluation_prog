DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. Been havin’ trouble gettin’ it all out, you see. Like it’s… stuck, sometimes. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now, and thought I oughta get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, "trouble getting it all out," and it feels stuck sometimes. That's helpful to know. When you say “a little while,” could you give me a better idea of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn't constant at first, just now and then. But it’s been more frequent lately. It worries me some, so I figured it was time to come in. I don’t like feelin’ like somethin’ isn’t workin’ right, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out, and it’s definitely worth looking into when things change or feel off. So, it started about three or four months ago, intermittent at first, and now more frequent. Can you describe what it feels like when it’s stuck?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not painful, exactly. More like… a fullness. Like there’s somethin’ there that won't come out. I gotta… strain a little, push a bit. And sometimes it just… drips. Not a strong stream like it used to be. It takes a while, sometimes, to get it empty. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fullness, needing to strain, a weaker stream, and taking longer to empty. Okay. And is it difficult to start the stream, or is it more trouble maintaining it once you get going?
PATIENT: It’s mostly startin’ it, I think. Once it gets goin’, it’s alright, mostly. But gettin’ it started… that's the hard part. Gotta focus on it, push a little. It's not like it won't come, just… slow and needs some effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty initiating the stream, then it flows okay once started. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the water? I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. It looks… normal, I suppose. Same color as always. No blood or nothin’ like that. I haven't seen anything unusual. I don't really check it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. I just ask to rule things out. No blood, color seems normal. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain alongside this?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. No fever, no chills. And my belly feels alright. Maybe a little achy sometimes, but that’s just my old age, I reckon. I've always been a little creaky. But no sharp pain or nothin’ like that. Just the trouble with… well, with the waterworks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Just the urinary symptoms. And you've mentioned some general aches, but nothing specific related to your abdomen. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it was alright. Just told me to take it easy. Other than that, nothin’ much. I take some vitamins, that's about it. And I’m a widower, if that’s important. My wife passed a few years back.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. And I'm sorry for your loss. Knowing about your heart history is helpful. Just taking vitamins is good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, and any allergies you have. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, ma'am. Never had a reaction to anything. And as for medicines… just those daily vitamins. One of those little multi-vitamin things. And sometimes, if my joints are achin’ real bad, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s not every day. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, daily multi-vitamin, and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick check of your prostate. That's a standard part of evaluating urinary symptoms in men. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam… alright. I suppose so. I ain’t been to a doctor in a while, so I’m a little… nervous, I guess. What does the prostate check involve, exactly? Just want to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable to feel a little nervous. The prostate check is a digital rectal exam, which means I'll be wearing a gloved, lubricated finger to gently feel your prostate through your rectum. It helps me assess the size, shape, and consistency of the prostate. It’s a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful, and it only takes a few seconds. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you're experiencing any discomfort at any point. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well… that don’t sound very pleasant. But if it helps you figure out what’s wrong… alright, I suppose. Just… please be gentle, Doctor. And tell me what you’re doin’ as you go, like you said. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, Dondre, if you could lie down on the exam table, please. We’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Alright, just relax and breathe normally. I’m going to listen to your belly now. Okay, sounds normal. Now, for the prostate exam. I’m going to ask you to bend your knees and lean forward a little. I’ll use some lubricant and then gently insert my finger. Remember, it will be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Okay, all done. It felt a little enlarged, but not dramatically so. It was symmetrical and didn't feel particularly tender. There were no obvious nodules or irregularities. That gives me some information. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you may have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. That's a common condition in men your age, where the prostate gland enlarges, which can make it difficult to urinate. However, to be sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a PSA test to check for prostate cancer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: BPH… that’s a mouthful. And prostate cancer… that sounds scary. But I suppose it’s better to know, right? If it’s somethin’ common, well, that’s a little reassuring. A urine test and a PSA test… alright. Yes, let’s do that. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just tell me what I need to do. And… what happens if it is somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question. It’s good you’re asking. The PSA test will give us a number. A higher number doesn’t necessarily mean cancer, many things can raise it. If it’s elevated, we might recommend further testing, like an MRI or a biopsy to get a more definitive answer. It’s important to remember that many men with elevated PSA levels do not have cancer. For now, let’s focus on the urine test and PSA test. I’ll write you a lab order. You can go to the lab at [Clinic Name/Address] anytime. It’s just a standard urine sample, and a simple blood draw for the PSA. The results usually take a few days. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and figure out the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. A urine sample and a blood draw. I can do that. [Clinic Name/Address]… I'll write that down. A few days, you say? Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel a little less worried now. I appreciate your patience with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad I could help ease your worries a bit. It’s important to ask questions, and I’m always happy to take the time to explain things. Here’s the lab order. Feel free to call the lab ahead of time if you have any questions about preparation. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your results come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll take it one step at a time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. You’ve been very kind. I’ll go get those tests done. And I’ll call if I have any questions. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Dondre. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. Take care of yourself. .
