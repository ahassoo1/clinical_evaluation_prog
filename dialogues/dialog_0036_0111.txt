DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I confess, I don’t recall scheduling an appointment. My wife, she likely arranged it. Something about my… complexion, she said. I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, and I suppose my skin is looking a bit…off. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this, if you don’t mind. A man’s got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s not uncommon for appointments to slip one’s mind, or for family members to assist with scheduling. And it’s good your wife is observant. We'll get to the bottom of what’s going on. So, when you say your skin is looking "off," can you describe that a bit more for me?
PATIENT: “Off” is as good a word as any, Doctor. It’s…darker, I suppose. Not a pleasant shade. And it seems to be getting worse. I work outdoors, you see. Reinforcing iron, rebar… strenuous work. Always have. Perhaps it’s the sun. Though I’ve been working in the sun for decades, and it’s never been this bad. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t have time for fanciful explanations. Is this going anywhere?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate you being direct. Decades of sun exposure can certainly contribute to skin changes, but we need to rule out other possibilities. You’re right to want answers. When you say “darker,” is it all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that's a good question. I hadn’t precisely cataloged it. It’s… mostly on my hands, I believe. And perhaps on my face. The parts that are constantly exposed, naturally. My legs are covered more often. Though, truthfully, Doctor, I’ve not been meticulously examining myself lately. A man has priorities. Is this… relevant?
DOCTOR: It is very relevant, sir. Focusing on the areas exposed to the sun is helpful. And it's perfectly understandable you haven't been meticulously examining yourself. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in the texture of your skin on your hands or face?
PATIENT: Texture? Well, it’s… rough, I suppose. Always has been. From the work, naturally. Calloused. I wouldn’t call it newly rough. It’s a working man’s skin, Doctor. Not some… delicate porcelain. But is that what you mean? I confess, I don’t pay much attention to such things.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. It's helpful to know it's been a longstanding roughness. When you say roughness, is it more like thickened skin, or are there any bumps, scales, or sores?
PATIENT: Bumps… no, not really. Scales… perhaps a little, on the backs of my hands. Very slight. And no sores, thankfully. Just… thickened, and a bit darkened, as I’ve said. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel rather foolish, describing my hands. A man works with iron, what do you expect? Smooth, soft skin? Is this getting us anywhere, or are we simply cataloging the obvious?
DOCTOR: We're not cataloging the obvious, sir, we're gathering important information. Even changes that seem obvious can be clues. The slight scaling is noted. Now, have you noticed any itching, pain, or bleeding associated with these changes on your hands or face?
PATIENT: Itching… occasionally. Not severe. Just a little… irritation. And no pain, certainly. And no bleeding. Never have. I've handled far worse than a little sun, Doctor. Though, truthfully, I've been rather tired lately. Perhaps that makes me more sensitive to such things. But no, no pain, no bleeding. Just a little… discomfort. Is that all?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, sir. No pain or bleeding is good. The itching, even if mild, is worth noting. And fatigue is certainly relevant. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses… well, I've had the usual. Colds, flus. Nothing serious. As for surgeries… let me think. Years ago, decades ago, I had my appendix removed. And… I had a rather nasty break in my wrist, working on a construction site, years ago. They set it, put it in a cast. That's about it, I believe. Nothing major. I'm a sturdy man, Doctor. Not prone to illness or injury.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Appendix removed and a wrist fracture. Do you recall approximately when those surgeries were performed?
PATIENT: The appendix… that would have been… oh, goodness. Perhaps forty years ago? Maybe more. It was before my wife and I were married, certainly. And the wrist… that was closer to thirty years ago, I believe. A rather awkward fall. Broke it clean through. Still aches a bit in the cold weather, but what doesn’t? I’m not one for dwelling on the past, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Understood. Forty years ago for the appendix and thirty years ago for the wrist fracture. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything my wife puts in front of me, and I take a little something for my arthritis when it flares up. Nothing serious. I've never been one to fuss over allergies. A sturdy constitution, you see. Honestly, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? My wife is going to be worried if I’m gone much longer.
DOCTOR: We are, sir. We're building a complete picture of your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, as I mentioned. It’s an over-the-counter cream, mostly. And sometimes, when my wife insists, a multivitamin. But nothing regularly. I prefer a good, healthy diet. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very simple man. I don't require a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Understood. Over-the-counter arthritis cream and occasional multivitamins. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have had any significant medical conditions, such as skin cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that's a difficult question. My parents… they passed away many years ago. My mother, she had… some sort of stomach ailment, I believe. Nothing specific. And my father… he worked very hard, always outdoors. He never complained of much. As for siblings, I had one brother, but we lost touch many years ago. I haven't spoken to him since my wedding. Honestly, Doctor, we weren't a close family. I don’t know much about their medical histories. It’s not something we discussed.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. That's not uncommon. It's helpful to know what you do know. Now, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Drink? Recreational drugs? Doctor, are you suggesting something? I am a respectable man! I may enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner on occasion, a small glass, mind you, but I certainly do not drink. And I have never touched a cigarette or any of those… unsavory substances in my life. I work hard, I eat well, and I provide for my family. I have no need for such vices. Is this line of questioning truly necessary, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed intrusive, sir. They are standard procedure, simply to get a complete picture of your health. I understand you occasionally enjoy a small glass of sherry. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at the skin on your hands and face. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with. Though I assure you, Doctor, you won't find anything. It's just the sun, I tell you. Decades of honest work. But do hurry, if you please. My wife will be worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Deep breath in… and out… good. Again… in… and out. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take a closer look at your hands. I see some areas of thickening and hyperpigmentation on the backs of your hands, as well as some slight scaling. The texture is rough, consistent with manual labor. I also notice some sun damage. On your face, I see similar hyperpigmentation, particularly around the cheeks and forehead. There are some fine lines and wrinkles, which are expected with age and sun exposure. I don’t see any open sores or concerning lesions. Okay, sir. All done. Everything seems consistent with long-term sun exposure and the effects of outdoor work. However, given the hyperpigmentation, I would like to be cautious and perform a simple skin biopsy to rule out any potential underlying issues. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Good heavens, Doctor! You're making a mountain out of a molehill. I told you, it's just the sun. I've spent my life working outdoors, what do you expect? I don’t need a “quick and painless procedure” to tell me what I already know. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to regret coming here. It seems you're determined to find something wrong where there is nothing to be found. No. I will not have a biopsy. I've wasted enough of my time here already. I think I’ll just go home and rest. Perhaps a little sunshine will do me good.
DOCTOR: Sir, I understand your reluctance, and I respect your decision. However, I am obligated to be thorough and rule out any potential concerns, especially given the hyperpigmentation. While sun exposure is a likely cause, it's important to ensure there isn't anything more serious going on. Since you're declining the biopsy, I recommend we monitor the areas closely for any changes in size, shape, or color. If you notice anything new or concerning, please return immediately. I can also provide you with a high-quality sunscreen and recommend protective clothing to minimize further sun exposure. And if you're concerned about fatigue, we can discuss some blood work to check for any underlying deficiencies. Would you be interested in either of those options?
