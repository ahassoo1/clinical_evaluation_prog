DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. I am here because of… pain. It is a troublesome pain, and I would like it addressed with some speed, if you please.
DOCTOR: Okay, “troublesome pain.” I understand wanting to get this sorted quickly. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… in my lower back. It started, I believe, approximately three weeks ago. It began as a dull ache after a long day of work erecting fence, and has grown steadily more insistent since then. It is a constant companion now, even when I am resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back pain that started about three weeks ago after some physical work – erecting fence, you said. And it's become constant, even at rest. Is it a sharp pain, a burning pain, or something else?
PATIENT: It is not sharp, Doctor. Nor is it burning. It is… a heavy ache. A deep throb, if that makes sense. Like a muscle that is constantly being pulled, but there is no actual pulling. It is difficult to explain properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, throbbing ache… like a constant muscle pull without the pull itself. That’s helpful. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Yes. Resting does provide some relief, but only temporarily. And… warm water. A warm bath, or a warm compress. It eases it for a little while, but it always returns. I find sitting is worse than almost anything, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so rest and warmth offer temporary relief, and sitting makes it worse. And what about standing, walking, or bending?
PATIENT: Standing is… tolerable, for short periods. Walking… it depends. A slow walk is alright. But bending… bending is exceptionally difficult. It sends a jolt right through my lower back. I try to avoid it as much as possible. Erecting fence has become… problematic, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, bending is particularly painful, walking is okay in moderation, and sitting is the worst. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness, tingling, or weakness. My legs feel… normal. I am able to walk without difficulty, aside from the discomfort in my back, of course. I have full control of my feet and legs. Is that what you were concerned about?
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to hear. No, just routine questions to rule things out. Let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: I do not, Doctor. I was, until recently, in reasonably good health. I have… Medicare, as you can see from my paperwork. My husband… he passed three years ago. He had some heart trouble, but I… I have had no significant illnesses or injuries. Just this back. It is quite frustrating, to have something develop at my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other significant medical history. I’m sorry to hear about your husband. It's definitely frustrating when something comes up unexpectedly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. Never been hospitalized. I’ve always been… a rather sturdy woman. This is a first. I’ve always been able to handle physical labor, and now… this. It is… concerning. Does this indicate something serious, in your opinion?
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. I understand your concern. It’s good that you haven’t had previous issues like this. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Do any of your family members have back problems, arthritis, or anything similar?
PATIENT: My mother… she suffered from arthritis in her hands and knees in her later years. It was a painful condition, but it did not affect her back. My father was a strong man, a rancher. He had no such troubles. As for any other family members… I am not certain. We were not… close. I spent much of my life away from my family, working. I do not have much information regarding their medical histories, I am afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had arthritis, but no one else with specific back problems that you're aware of. And finally, just to get a complete picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I do not drink alcohol. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I have never had any interest in such things. I live a… simple life. I work hard, and I try to be a responsible member of my community. I believe that is all that is required. Shall we discuss treatment options now, if you please? I would like to return to work as soon as is safely possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. And you want to get back to work – I understand. Before we talk treatment, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your range of motion and see where the pain is most concentrated. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… acceptable. I would prefer to resolve this quickly, and if a physical exam will assist in that endeavor, then please proceed. I only ask that it be… efficient, if you would be so kind. I have several commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I'll be as efficient as possible. If you could lie down on your back for me, please?
PATIENT: Very well. Please, do not hesitate to inform me if any of this causes undue discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now… it is a six. A steady six. It is not the worst it has been, but it is certainly not comfortable. It is… a persistent ache. It is difficult to ignore, even when I am lying still.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six. Alright, and how about when I lift your leg like this?
PATIENT: It… creates a slight pull in my back. A mild discomfort, but nothing unbearable. Perhaps a seven, momentarily. It quickly returns to the usual six, once the leg is lowered. It is the stretching that causes the issue, I believe. The weight of the leg, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you bend forward?
PATIENT: It is… difficult, Doctor. It creates a sharp pain. Not a ten, but… perhaps an eight. I cannot bend very far without experiencing significant discomfort. It feels as though something is… caught. A muscle, perhaps? I apologize for the slight sound. It is merely… protest from my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight when bending forward. Alright, and how about when I check your reflexes?
PATIENT: They seem… normal. No pain. No discomfort. Just a… tapping. It is… peculiar. The pain is concentrated specifically in the lower back. It does not radiate down my legs, and it does not seem to affect my reflexes. Do you have any preliminary thoughts on the cause of this ailment, Doctor? I would appreciate a candid assessment, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, reflexes are normal, no radiating pain, and the pain is focused in the lower back. Based on the exam, it sounds like a muscle strain or sprain is the most likely cause. It's hard to say exactly how severe without imaging, but it doesn't seem to be anything immediately alarming, like a pinched nerve or fracture. I’m going to recommend an X-ray just to be sure, but I suspect it's something we can manage conservatively with physical therapy, pain medication, and rest. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That… sounds acceptable, Doctor. I am relieved to hear that it does not appear to be anything… grave. An X-ray is… prudent, I suppose, and I would be amenable to physical therapy and pain medication, if deemed necessary. The thought of prolonged rest is… undesirable, but I understand the importance of allowing the muscle to heal. Could you clarify the type of pain medication you are considering? And approximately how long would physical therapy entail? I have commitments, as you know, and I must plan accordingly.
DOCTOR: Okay. For pain medication, I’d likely start with an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or naproxen. If that doesn’t provide enough relief, we can discuss a short course of a muscle relaxant and perhaps a stronger pain reliever. We'll start with the lowest effective dose. As for physical therapy, a typical course is 6-8 weeks, with sessions 2-3 times per week. They’ll teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles, improve your posture, and prevent future injuries. I’m going to order the X-ray now, and the tech will come in shortly. While we’re waiting, let's go over your medical history one more time just to be thorough. Are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to any substance. My husband… he was allergic to shellfish, but I do not share that affliction. And I have no… sensitivities to any medications, as far as I am aware. I have taken ibuprofen in the past, for headaches, with no ill effects. The X-ray sounds… efficient. I appreciate your thoroughness. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let us proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies. Alright, I’ve sent the order for the X-ray. The tech should be in shortly to get that done. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose muscle relaxant. Start taking it tonight before bed. It will help ease the muscle spasms and allow you to rest more comfortably. We’ll review the X-ray results once they’re available and tailor a more specific treatment plan to your needs. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No further questions at this moment. A muscle relaxant sounds… acceptable. And I trust your assessment regarding the X-ray results. I appreciate your efficiency and your… candidness. I believe that is all for the time being. I shall await the arrival of the technician. Do let me know if you require any further information from my person.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I don't think I do at the moment, but I’ll let you know if anything comes up. The technician should be here any minute. Just let them know if you experience any discomfort during the X-ray. I’ll be back to review the results with you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Hopefully, we’ll get this sorted out quickly. Thank you, Lakiya. .
