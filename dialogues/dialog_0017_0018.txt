DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, you understand. I don’t quite recall when it started, to be honest. Things… blur, these days. It’s just… frequent urination, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. And you can't pinpoint a specific onset?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m afraid not. It’s… gradual. Like the tide coming in, perhaps. I simply noticed it was… more often than it used to be. I don’t keep a strict tally, you see. It's not as though I planned to monitor it. Just… a general sense of needing to go more frequently, both day and night. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vague descriptions are rarely helpful, Mr. Verbos. Are we talking every hour?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Every hour… no, not quite every hour. Though, some days it feels that way. Perhaps… every two or three hours during the day? And… maybe twice during the night? It varies, you understand. I apologize for the imprecision. It’s difficult to be specific when one isn’t… keeping records. Is twice a night concerning? I’ve always slept rather soundly, and waking is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive is hardly a medical term, Mr. Verbos. Do you experience any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain at all. And no burning sensation. It's simply… the volume, I suppose. And the frequency, naturally. It’s not uncomfortable, just… inconvenient. And a little… unsettling, if I’m to be honest. One doesn’t enjoy being tied to the facilities, you understand. Do you think it might be… my age?
DOCTOR: Age plays a role in many things, Mr. Verbos. Let’s not jump to conclusions. Are you experiencing any difficulty starting the stream, or a weak flow?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No difficulty at all. The stream is… perfectly normal. As it always has been, I believe. Strong and consistent. It's not that, certainly. It's just… the need to go, so often. And sometimes… well, sometimes it's a rather large volume, unexpectedly. It’s rather… startling, actually. Do you understand? I apologize for the details, but I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Any changes in your fluid intake recently?
PATIENT: Changes in fluid intake… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I drink… tea, mostly. A few glasses throughout the day. And water, of course. I haven't increased my consumption, certainly. Perhaps I've been slightly warmer than usual lately, and that’s made me thirsty? It’s been quite humid, you understand. I haven't made a conscious effort to drink more. Are you thinking it might be too much fluid? That seems… unlikely.
DOCTOR: Unlikely or not, it needs to be considered. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits, Doctor? Well… no, not really. Everything seems… regular, if you'll pardon the expression. Nothing out of the ordinary. The same as always, I suppose. Though, I must confess, I don't dwell on such matters. Do you think it could be related to… the urination? It all seems rather disparate, if I'm to be honest. Is there something I should be looking for? I apologize for my ignorance.
DOCTOR: I’ll need to conduct a quick physical examination, Mr. Verbos. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with abdominal palpation. It's unlikely to be enjoyable, but necessary.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe it’s necessary. Abdominal palpation… I haven’t had one of those in… well, I can’t recall, to be honest. I trust it won’t be too… intrusive? I apologize for my apprehension. It's simply that I am not accustomed to medical examinations.
DOCTOR: Relax, Mr. Verbos. I'm assessing for bladder distention and any tenderness. Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. No palpable masses. Bladder is not significantly distended. Now, I’m going to perform a digital rectal exam. This is to assess prostate size and tone.
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh. I see. Is that… absolutely necessary, Doctor? I confess, I find the prospect… unsettling. Is there not another way to ascertain prostate size? I apologize for my reluctance, but it is a rather… personal examination, you understand. I trust you’ll be… quick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, I assure you this is standard procedure given your symptoms. It's a crucial part of the evaluation. While other methods exist, they are less reliable. We need to rule out prostatic hypertrophy, which is a common cause of frequent urination in men your age. I will be as swift and discreet as possible. Please bear with me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. I trust you’ll be gentle. And… quick, as you said. Please just let me know when it’s over. I apologize for my… lack of composure. It is simply… a sensitive matter. I trust this won't take long?
DOCTOR: Prostate is mildly enlarged, but smooth. No nodules or areas of tenderness detected. Now, I'll need a urine sample for analysis. Please follow me to the restroom and use the provided container. Be sure to collect a midstream sample. I’ll leave the instructions on the counter. We'll also need a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying issues. I'll send the orders to the lab now.
PATIENT: A mildly enlarged prostate… I see. Is that… serious, Doctor? And a metabolic panel… is that also to do with the… prostate? A midstream sample… yes, yes, I understand. A mild enlargement… it sounds rather ominous. Thank you, Doctor. I will… collect the sample. Hopefully, it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Mildly enlarged prostate… age-related, most likely. But we can't rule out other causes without the lab results. Let’s just see what the urine sample and metabolic panel reveal. I need to get through this appointment as quickly as possible. These tests will at least give us a starting point.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I trust I collected it correctly? It was… rather awkward, to be honest. I hope it’s sufficient. I tried my best to follow the instructions. It’s rather unsettling, worrying about… what the results might show. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Sufficient. We’ll send this to the lab immediately. Now, while we wait for the results – which will take approximately 30-45 minutes – let's discuss your medications and medical history in more detail. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: Medications… Well, let me see. I believe I am prescribed… something for my blood pressure. A small white pill, taken each morning. And… occasionally, a pain reliever for my arthritis. Nothing major, you understand. Just when it flares up. I can’t recall the names, unfortunately. Things… blur, as I said. Medicare covers them, I believe. Is that sufficient information, Doctor? It's difficult to recall specifics.
DOCTOR: “Small white pill.” Very helpful. Do you recall who prescribed these medications, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that is a difficult question, Doctor. I believe… Dr. Havelka? Yes, Dr. Havelka. He was my primary care physician before… well, before he retired. It was… some time ago, now. I’ve seen a few different doctors since, filling prescriptions as needed. I confess, I haven’t kept meticulous records. It all becomes… rather hazy, you understand. Is Dr. Havelka a name that’s familiar to you? Perhaps you have his records?
DOCTOR: I do not have access to Dr. Havelka’s records, Mr. Verbos. And “something for blood pressure” is not a diagnosis. We'll need to identify the specific medication for accurate assessment. Do you have a list of your medications at home?
PATIENT: A list… no, Doctor. I truly do not. I’ve searched for one on numerous occasions, but… it seems to have vanished. It’s a rather frustrating situation, I confess. I rely on the pharmacy to remind me, generally. Perhaps they have a record? I apologize for the inconvenience. It's simply… my memory isn't what it once was. Do you think it’s possible to obtain a list from Medicare? Perhaps they have a record of my prescriptions?
DOCTOR: We can try to obtain a list from Medicare, Mr. Verbos. But it’s unlikely to be a quick process. Frankly, it would have been far more efficient if you had simply remembered the names of your medications. While we wait for that process, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: I see. Family history… well, my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. A weak heart, they said. He passed away relatively young, I suppose. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis, quite severely. Like myself, actually. I believe there was also some… diabetes, on my mother’s side? It was several generations back, though. It's difficult to recall specifics. My family wasn't… particularly forthcoming about medical details. Is that sufficient information, Doctor? I apologize for the vagueness. It's simply… so long ago.
DOCTOR: “Weak heart” and “some diabetes” are not diagnoses, Mr. Verbos. Do you have any siblings?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have a sister. Eliska. She… lives in Prague. We don’t speak often, unfortunately. She’s… quite independent. As far as I know, she is in good health. She always was… the stronger one. I believe she’s retired now, perhaps a teacher? It's been… some time since we corresponded. I don’t recall any significant medical conditions affecting her, but… I haven’t asked directly. We don’t… discuss such matters. Is that helpful, Doctor? I apologize for the lack of specifics. It’s difficult to recall details about my sister’s life.
DOCTOR: Okay. Finally, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke, drink, drugs…? Oh, goodness, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never been one for such things. I enjoy a cup of tea, as I mentioned, and perhaps a small pastry occasionally, but… that’s the extent of it. I lead a… rather quiet life. I enjoy reading and… gardening. I never smoked. Never touched alcohol. And certainly never… recreational drugs. Is that satisfactory, Doctor? I trust that’s… reassuring? I strive to maintain a… healthy lifestyle, as much as is possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. The lab results are back. Your urine analysis is unremarkable. Your basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Given your mildly enlarged prostate and unremarkable test results, I suspect benign prostatic hyperplasia – BPH. It’s a common condition in men your age. We will monitor this for now. I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine. I will also prescribe a medication to help relax the bladder and improve urine flow.
PATIENT: Benign… prostatic hyperplasia? Is that… serious, Doctor? And monitoring it…? Increasing fluid intake… I already drink quite a lot of tea, you understand. And medication…? Will that have any side effects? I confess, I am not fond of taking medication. I strive to avoid it whenever possible. What sort of side effects are we talking about, Doctor? And what will happen if the monitoring shows… something worse? I apologize for the questions, but I am rather… apprehensive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, BPH is not immediately life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. The medication, Tamsulosin, can cause dizziness or lightheadedness in some patients. If you experience those, you should stop taking it and contact me immediately. As for “something worse,” we’ll discuss that if it arises. We’re simply monitoring for progression or other concerning symptoms. Here is the prescription. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Dizzy spells… That doesn’t sound pleasant. Three months…? Is that not… a long time to wait? What if I feel worse before then? And what if the medication… doesn’t work? Is there not another option? A more… natural remedy, perhaps? I truly do dislike taking medication, Doctor. I apologize for my persistence, but I am rather… anxious about all of this. Perhaps increasing the tea would be sufficient? Is there not a risk of… drinking too much fluid? I truly appreciate your patience, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, I understand your apprehension. However, increasing tea intake will not resolve BPH. We are monitoring the condition, not ignoring it. I've addressed your concerns and given you a plan. If you develop any concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment, contact my office immediately. Now, I have other patients waiting. Good day. .
