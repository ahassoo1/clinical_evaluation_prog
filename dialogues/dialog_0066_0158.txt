DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris! I'm Dr. Condray. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Condray, was it? Yes, yes. Well, it's about a letter. A letter for… a pet. My niece, you see, she's moving, and they need a letter saying I approve of her having one. Something about the landlord, I think. Honestly, these young people and their rules… It's all a bit much, isn’t it? I just need you to write something official-looking.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a letter stating your approval for your niece to have a pet, as required by her landlord. While that’s… not a typical medical request, I can certainly document a statement like that. Just to be clear, you’re stating that you, as a responsible adult, support your niece’s ability to care for a pet, and you have no concerns about her doing so?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That’s it perfectly. No concerns at all. Though… what kind of pet is she getting? She didn't say, you know. These girls… never think to share details. A dog, I suppose? Or maybe one of those… cats? I don't really keep up with these things. But yes, I support it. Absolutely. Just… a nice, official letter would be lovely. It needs to look important, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter of support for a pet. We can definitely make it look official. It’s helpful to know what kind of pet she’s getting, if possible, just so we can be specific. But we can certainly draft something general now, stating your support for her responsible pet ownership, and we can amend it later if you find out the details. Do you have any concerns at all about her ability to care for a pet – financially, with her time, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, financially? Well, she says she’s got a good job. A marketing job, I think? Something with social media. Honestly, I don't follow any of that. She’s always on her phone. But she seems… settled. Time, though… that’s another matter. She’s always going out, you know? With her friends. Fancy restaurants, trips… I just don’t want the poor thing neglected. But she says she’ll make time. Girls are always saying things, aren’t they? It’s just… I want to be sure. A pet is a responsibility. A big one.
DOCTOR: Right, so you support her having a pet overall, but you have some minor concerns about her time commitments, and ensuring the pet's well-being. We can definitely acknowledge that in the letter – something like stating your confidence in her ability to balance her responsibilities, while also emphasizing the importance of consistent care for the animal. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. "Sensible" is good. That’s exactly what I want. “Consistent care”. That’s important. And perhaps something about the… companionship a pet can offer? She’s a bit lonely, my niece. Always on her phone, but not really connecting with people, you know? Yes, mention the companionship. And… make it look official, please. Really official. I want that landlord to take it seriously. These young people… they need to learn a bit of respect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will definitely emphasize the potential companionship a pet can offer, and the importance of responsible pet ownership. I’ll use the clinic letterhead and include all the necessary details to make it look as official as possible. Give me just a moment to finish drafting it. Here we are. I’ll read it aloud to you, and you can tell me if it captures everything. “To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to express my support for [Niece's Name] in her pursuit of pet ownership. As a responsible adult, I have full confidence in her ability to provide a loving and stable environment for an animal companion. I understand the significant responsibilities involved in pet ownership and believe [Niece's Name] is capable of meeting those needs. While recognizing the demands of her lifestyle, I am confident she will prioritize the well-being of her pet and ensure its consistent care, recognizing the companionship and emotional support a pet can provide. Sincerely, Rufino Condray, MD” How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, that’s… pretty good, actually. "Consistent care" is good. And "loving and stable environment", yes. Though… it sounds a little… enthusiastic. A bit too supportive, perhaps? I did mention my concerns about her time. Perhaps tone down the “full confidence” a bit? Maybe just say “I believe she is capable”, instead of "full confidence"? It needs to be official, remember. Not gushing. And… is there a space for a date? It needs a date. A proper, official date.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right. Official is the key here, and we want to convey support while acknowledging your concerns. I’ve removed “full confidence” and replaced it with “I believe she is capable”. I’ve also added a date line. Here’s the revised version: August 2, 2025 To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to express my support for [Niece's Name] in her pursuit of pet ownership. As a responsible adult, I believe she is capable of providing a loving and stable environment for an animal companion. I understand the significant responsibilities involved in pet ownership and believe she will prioritize the well-being of her pet. Sincerely, Rufino Condray, MD Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… much better. Yes. “Prioritize the well-being”, that’s good. Sensible. And the date is there, which is important. Can we… add my name? And perhaps my address? Just to make it official, you understand. A proper, official document needs all the details. I’m Deloris Wrye, by the way. And my address is… Oh dear. Now, what is my address…? It’s… somewhere in the suburbs, I think. Let me see…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. We’ll include your full name and address to make the document official. No rush at all. If you don’t have the address immediately available, we can add it later. We just need to ensure all the information is accurate. Perhaps we can start with just your name for now, and add the address when you’re ready?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… sensible. Just my name for now, then. Deloris Wrye. W-R-Y-E. Yes. And… I suppose you'll need my date of birth eventually? Oh dear. These details… they’re always so difficult to remember. I’m getting on, you know. But my name is definitely Deloris Wrye. And I support my niece having a pet. That’s the important thing. Now, where did I put my purse…?
DOCTOR: That’s the most important thing, Ms. Wrye. Your support for your niece. I’ve added your name to the letter. We can gather the remaining details at your convenience. Here’s the current draft: August 2, 2025 To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to express my support for [Niece's Name] in her pursuit of pet ownership. As a responsible adult, I believe she will prioritize the well-being of her pet. Sincerely, Rufino Condray, MD Deloris Wrye Would you like me to print this out for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be lovely. A proper, official printed copy. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Though… I still don’t understand why these young people need so much paperwork for everything. It wasn't like this in my day. But never mind. Yes, the printed copy, please. And… is there a charge for all this?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. Regarding the charge, let me check our policy for documentation requests. It appears there’s a small administrative fee for letters like this, to cover the printing and documentation time. I believe it’s $25. Would you like me to have the receptionist process that for you?
PATIENT: Oh. $25? Hmm. Well. I suppose. It’s for my niece, after all. And these things can’t be done for free, I suppose. Yes, go ahead. Process it. But it's a bit much, isn't it? All this paperwork... and the charge! Still, my niece… she deserves a pet. Yes. Process it, please. And thank you, Doctor. For everything. Now, where did I park…? .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I'm glad I could help. I’ll let the receptionist know you’re ready to settle the payment. If you have any trouble finding your car, feel free to ask the staff at the front desk, they're always happy to assist. Have a lovely day, and I hope your niece enjoys her new pet! .
