DOCTOR: Good morning, Norval. It's lovely to meet you. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. Why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Lahn. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this…feeling full really fast. Like, I haven’t even had a proper plate of food in a while, just a few bites and I’m stuffed. It’s been going on for a bit now, maybe a month or so. Not sure what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning, Norval. Feeling full quickly, even after only a small amount of food, for a month…that definitely warrants a closer look. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, a month…ish. It didn’t happen all at once, you know? It started slowly. I used to have a good appetite, always enjoyed a hearty meal. Then, maybe six weeks ago, I noticed I wasn’t finishing my plate. Thought it was just getting old, to be honest. Now…now it’s like a few spoonfuls and I gotta stop. It's just…weird. I don’t feel sick after, just…satisfied too quickly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Norval. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes like this. And it’s important to investigate, even if it started gradually. So, no nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: No, no sickness at all. Not even a little bit. And my stomach doesn’t hurt, not exactly. It's not painful. It just feels…full, like I said. Like I’ve eaten a big meal when I haven't. Sometimes a bit uncomfortable, maybe, but not pain. I can still eat, just…not much. It's more frustrating than anything, to be honest. I like my food!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Norval. It's definitely concerning when something changes with your appetite, especially when you enjoy eating. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I haven’t really been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. My wife, Elsie, she used to, but…well, she passed away last year. I haven’t kept up with things like that since. I feel like maybe I’ve lost a bit, but I couldn’t say for sure. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But I’ve also been…well, not as active since Elsie…It's hard to say. Sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Norval. It's perfectly understandable that you haven’t been keeping track of things like that, especially with your loss. Please take all the time you need. Okay, so possible unintentional weight loss. Let's move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – things like heartburn, bloating, changes in your bowel habits, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No heartburn, thankfully. Never really had that problem. And no, nothing with my…well, you know. Everything’s regular in that department. Bloating…maybe a little sometimes, but I get that just from…old age, I figure. Swallowing? No trouble at all. I can eat anything I want, just not much of it. I still enjoy a good piece of salmon, when I can manage it. It's just...the quantity is the issue. It's like my stomach shrunk or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information, Norval. No difficulty swallowing, regular bowel habits, no heartburn. Now, a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, they said my blood pressure was a bit high, put me on some pills for it. I take those every day. Other than that… nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. No diabetes, no cancer, nothing like that. Elsie always took care of the medical stuff, kept all the records. I'm afraid I don't remember much detail. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Norval. We can certainly look up your medications and any past medical history in our system. I see you're currently taking medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: I think… Elsie called it Lisinopril. That sound right? A little white pill, I take one every morning with my coffee. It’s been years now, seems to be keeping things under control. Doctor said to keep taking it unless he told me otherwise. I haven’t seen a doctor in a while, to be honest. Mostly just Elsie handled all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for high blood pressure. That's good to know. We can verify the dosage in the system here. Yes, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Elsie always used to ask me that too, every time I took a new pill. I eat most anything, never had trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors fishing, never bothered me none. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Always been a healthy fella, 'til recently, that is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Norval. No known allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother, she lived to be 92, healthy as a horse right up 'til the end. Father passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. Elsie’s mother had…arthritis, I believe. Badly crippled up in her later years. Other than that, not much that I can recall. No cancer, no diabetes, nothing major on either side of the family. We weren’t really ones for talking about medical stuff much. Mostly just focused on living life, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Norval. Just focusing on living life. Okay, last few quick questions. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. Elsie didn't like it, and I didn't want to upset her. I used to have a little beer now and then, with dinner, but I haven't touched a drop since she passed. And no, definitely no drugs. Never had any interest in that sort of thing. Just a simple man, really. I prefer a good cup of tea, if you don't mind. And a bit of quiet time with my thoughts.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Norval. A simple life sounds lovely. Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable or anything. Old bones aren't as flexible as they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Norval. I will be gentle. If you could just sit here for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. Mild tenderness in the epigastric region. I’m also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. And finally, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Overall, your physical exam is fairly normal, but the tenderness in your upper abdomen is something we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Hmm, tenderness in my upper stomach, you say? That's where I feel a little full, I suppose. It doesn’t hurt, just…uncomfortable. Is that bad, Doctor? What do you think is causing it? I'm starting to get a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know your concerns, Norval. It's perfectly normal to be worried when something changes with your health. The tenderness in your upper abdomen, combined with the early fullness you've been experiencing, could be a number of things. It could be something simple like gastritis, or a mild ulcer, but we need to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, liver function, and a test to check for Helicobacter pylori, which is a bacteria that can cause stomach problems. I also think a stool test to check for blood would be a good idea, just to be safe. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and stool tests… Oh dear. Sounds serious. But…if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, I suppose so. Elsie always said I should listen to the doctors. I trust your judgement. Just…please let me know what you find out, alright? I'm a bit anxious, to be honest. What kind of things are you looking for, exactly? Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable that you're anxious, Norval. We're just trying to gather information to understand what's going on, and most of the time, these tests help us pinpoint the cause and get you feeling better. The blood tests will give us an overview of your overall health and help us check your liver function. The Helicobacter pylori test will tell us if that bacteria is present in your stomach. And the stool test will just check for any hidden blood, which could indicate an issue in your digestive tract. We’re looking for anything that might be causing your symptoms – inflammation, infection, or any other abnormalities. It’s important to remember that these tests don’t necessarily mean something serious is wrong. Often, it's something easily treatable. I'll order the tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take a small blood sample and a stool sample. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or black, tarry stools – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. A few days for the results… I can manage that. And I’ll remember what you said about the emergency room. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It helps to know what's going on, even if it's not good news. So, just down the hall for the tests, then? I'll go do that now. Thank you again, Doctor Lahn. You've been very kind. I'm a bit nervous, but I feel better knowing we're trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Norval. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Please don't hesitate to let the lab technician know if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you in a few days when the results are back. Take care, and don't worry too much.
