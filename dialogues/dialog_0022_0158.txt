DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tosca, you said? Right. Well, it’s about a letter. A pet ownership letter, I think they called it. My daughter...or was it my niece?...she needs it for her apartment. Something about the landlord. Honestly, all this paperwork these days. It's a bit of a fuss, isn’t it? I just need a doctor to…confirm I can handle a pet, I suppose. It’s a little dog. A small one.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A pet ownership letter, sometimes called an emotional support animal letter, although that's a different process. It sounds like your landlord requires documentation confirming you are physically and mentally capable of caring for a pet. We can certainly address that. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about the dog?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The dog…let me think. It’s…fluffy. Definitely fluffy. And small. A little yappy thing, if I recall correctly. My daughter…or niece…they picked it out. It’s not a big dog, that much I know. A lapdog, I think they called it. What do you need to know exactly? I’m not much of a dog person, honestly. Always preferred cats myself. Though, I suppose a small dog is…manageable.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We don't need to get into breed specifics or anything. I just want to ensure you don’t have any physical limitations that would make caring for a pet difficult – things like trouble bending, lifting, or walking. Also, I'd like to briefly discuss your overall health and mental wellbeing to make sure you're able to handle the responsibilities. Let’s start with your physical health. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – like arthritis, heart problems, or anything else that limits your activity?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well…let me see. I had a bad back a few years ago, but that’s mostly okay now. Physical therapy helped. Though it does twinge sometimes, especially if I bend over for too long. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, you know? Getting older. It’s…a process. I wouldn't say it stops me from doing things, exactly. I still get around. But I don’t go running marathons, if that’s what you're asking. Mentally? I’m fine. Perfectly fine. A bit stressed with family, always something going on. But who isn’t, really?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, occasional back discomfort and some knee issues, but generally able to manage your daily activities. And some stress with family, which is understandable. Do you currently take any medications for your back or knees?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… sometimes, when my back is really acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing prescribed, mind you. And occasionally, a muscle relaxant if it's particularly bad, but that's…rare. My daughter – or was it my niece? – keeps telling me to see a specialist, but I just haven’t gotten around to it. It’s not that bad, you know? I can usually manage with the ibuprofen. And a good lie-down. That usually does the trick. I don’t take anything regularly, if that makes sense. Just as needed.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Ibuprofen as needed for back pain, and nothing regularly. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see… I think I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when I was a child. A rash, I believe. But that was ages ago. I haven't taken penicillin in years, so I can’t be certain. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. No known allergies. I’m usually pretty good with medications, to be honest. I just don’t take many, as I said. It’s best to avoid them if you can, isn't it? All those side effects… dreadful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Penicillin allergy documented. Now, just a few quick questions about your overall mental wellbeing. You mentioned some family stress. Has this been ongoing, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, the family… it’s always something. Honestly, it’s been going on for years. My daughter… or was it my niece?… they always seem to be in some sort of trouble. Relationship drama, financial issues… you name it. It’s exhausting, really. It comes in waves, you know? Sometimes it’s quiet, and then suddenly… boom. Another crisis. It’s just…life, I suppose. I try to help where I can, but it’s… draining. And I'm not getting any younger, you know? It takes a toll.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're providing a lot of emotional support to your family, and that can be very taxing. Do you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or anxious as a result of these ongoing stressors?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Overwhelmed? Constantly. Anxious? Yes, I suppose so. I worry about them, naturally. And I worry about myself, if I'm being honest. Keeping up with everything is…a lot. I try to stay busy, you know? Distract myself. But it’s always there, nagging at the back of my mind. It’s not…debilitating, mind you. I function. I get things done. But it’s… draining. I just wish they’d all sort their lives out, you know? Is that too much to ask? Honestly, sometimes I just need a long holiday… somewhere quiet. With no phone calls. And no family drama. A girl can dream, can’t she?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A holiday sounds wonderful. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant amount of stress and worry related to your family’s situation. We can document this as ongoing stress and anxiety. Now, to ensure you are able to adequately care for a pet, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. I'll check your range of motion, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. A physical examination sounds perfectly reasonable. I suppose it’s good to check. Though, honestly, I feel alright. A bit tired, maybe, but that’s just life, isn’t it? Go ahead. I’ll just sit here and try not to fidget too much. Though, my knees do creak a bit when I stand up. Just a warning. Don't be alarmed. It's just…old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Shoulder range of motion is full and pain-free. Elbows are full and pain-free. Wrists are also full and pain-free. Knees have some crepitus with range of motion, and mild discomfort reported with full flexion. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Overall, your physical exam is largely normal. You have some mild crepitus and discomfort in your knees, but this doesn’t appear to significantly limit your overall function. Based on this exam and our conversation, I believe you are physically capable of caring for a small dog. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s…reassuring. Good. I didn't want to cause a fuss over nothing. Crepitus, you say? Is that…bad? Honestly, I mostly just worry about bending down to pick things up. And walking the dog, of course. But I suppose I can manage. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just…thank you, Doctor. It’s a relief to have it confirmed. So, can you just write that letter now? For my daughter – or niece, as it were. They’re really counting on it. And honestly, I’d like to get this sorted and be done with it. It’s a bit of a weight off my shoulders, you know? Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. Crepitus is just the sound of the joints moving – it's very common as we age and doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. As long as you’re able to manage your daily activities and aren’t experiencing severe pain, it’s not a cause for concern. Here you go. This confirms that you are physically capable of caring for a pet. It also includes a note about your ability to manage daily activities despite some mild knee discomfort. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. Yes, that looks perfect. Absolutely perfect. No, I don't think that's all. You've been very thorough. I appreciate your time. Honestly, it's a relief to have that sorted. My daughter – or niece – will be so pleased. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.
