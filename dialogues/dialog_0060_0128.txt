DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. Um… well, it’s my joints, mostly. They get…stuck, I guess, in the mornings. It’s hard to explain. Not painful, exactly, just… stiff. It takes a while to get moving.
DOCTOR: Hmm, stiff joints in the mornings. I see. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. A while, definitely. I… I don’t really keep track of things like that. Maybe… a few months? Longer? It comes and goes, you know? Some days are worse than others. I just thought maybe you could… help with it?
DOCTOR: Right. Comes and goes. Okay. And which joints are we talking about specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, um… mostly my hands, I think. And my knees, sometimes. My back too, a little. Not all at once, though. It’s… hard to pinpoint. They just feel…creaky, like an old door. Does that make sense? I used to do a lot of gardening, maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Gardening, alright. And when you say creaky, is that accompanied by any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… no, not really. No redness either, that I’ve noticed. Just… the stiffness. And the creaking sound, when I move them. It’s mostly just annoying, to be honest. Makes it hard to get things done in the mornings. I like to make breakfast for the grandkids, but it’s tough when my hands are…well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. No swelling or redness, just stiffness and creaking. And it’s worse in the mornings, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely worse in the mornings. It… eases up as the day goes on. Like I said, by afternoon I’m usually okay. But getting started… that’s the hard part. It’s like I haven’t moved all night. I try to stretch, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any pain at any point during the day with these joints, even if it's mild?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes, yes. Not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes, like everything else. Usually after I’ve been using my hands for a while. Like when I’m kneading dough for the grandkids. Or… well, doing anything really. It’s hard to explain. I just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, stiffness, creaking, and occasional dull ache, worse in the mornings and improving throughout the day. Have you tried any over-the-counter medications for this, like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: Oh… I think I have some ibuprofen somewhere… in the cabinet, maybe? I haven’t really used it much. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can help it. I mostly just… try to take it easy. I don’t know if that makes sense. My husband… he used to handle all the medicine. It's been a while since he… well. I haven't really thought about it much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Well, let’s just do a quick exam of your joints just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just want to be able to make breakfast without feeling like an old lady!
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your hands. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: There… like that? It feels a bit… tight. Not painful, just… stiff. And… harder than it used to be, I think. I don’t know… it’s hard to tell. I haven't really paid attention, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now can you open your hand, spreading your fingers as wide as you can?
PATIENT: Um… like this? It’s… tight. It doesn’t want to go all the way. I… I don’t know what’s wrong with my hands. They just don’t work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now let’s check your knees. Can you bend your knees, one at a time, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There… like this? It’s a little hard. They don’t bend as easily as they used to. And… they make a noise.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noticing some stiffness and limited range of motion in your hands and knees, with some crepitus. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis. It's very common, especially as we get older. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work – just to check for inflammation and other conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? Is that… bad? My husband… he had bad knees, towards the end. But he was a… a very active man. I mostly just… garden and bake. Blood work? Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to know what’s going on. And… if there’s anything I can do to make it better.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Ms. Voner, but it’s something we want to manage. It’s a degenerative condition, meaning it gets worse over time, but there are things we can do to slow it down and alleviate your symptoms. The blood work will help us rule out other causes, like rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different condition. In the meantime, I recommend gentle exercise – things like walking or swimming – to keep your joints mobile. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options. And I’ll write you a referral to a physical therapist, who can teach you some exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. Gentle exercise, I can probably manage that. I used to enjoy walking. And a physical therapist… that sounds helpful. I just… I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden, Ms. Voner. We are here to help you maintain your quality of life. Now, I'll get the lab order for the blood work. It's just a routine check, and we should have the results back in a few days. I'll also write the referral for the physical therapist. And we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a more tailored plan for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds very good, doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s… nice to have someone explain things clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. That's what I'm here for. I want you to feel comfortable and empowered to manage your health. Now, let me just get these documents for you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. I will. You’ve been very kind.
