DOCTOR: Right. Candis Hardenburgh, 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day to sit here explaining things. It's this tiredness. Just... dragging. And it's getting worse. Plus, and don’t look at me like that, I... I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to be embarrassing. It’s just… a craving, you know? Don't make a big deal of it.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, mostly. From the garden. Don't act so shocked! It’s… hard to explain. It just feels good going down, alright? And it started small, just a little bit when I was out weeding, but now… I find myself thinking about it. It doesn’t hurt anything, does it? I haven’t noticed anything wrong, except being tired. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Well, consuming soil is… unusual. It can introduce parasites, bacteria… all sorts of things. We'll need to run some tests. But first, let’s focus on this tiredness. When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Tests? Really? It's just dirt! Look, it started… hmm… maybe six months ago? Gradually, you know? I just figured it was getting old. Everyone gets tired when they get old. But it’s not just tired. It's like… empty tired. And now this dirt thing. Honestly, I haven’t been sleeping well either, but who does at my age? Can we just get a pill for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Sleeping poorly is relevant. And this "empty tired," as you call it… can you describe that further?
PATIENT: Further? Honestly, it's like... my batteries are dead. Completely flat. I wake up just as exhausted as when I went to bed. And it's not a physical tiredness, not like after gardening. It’s… in my bones, I guess? It’s hard to explain to someone who isn't… well, never mind. Look, I just want to feel normal again. I used to have energy, you know? Now I just sit. And think about dirt. Is that all you need to know? Because I really do have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I’m hungry, don’t eat when I’m not. I don’t fuss much with food. It all tastes the same anyway, truthfully. Though, now that you mention it… I haven't been wanting meat much lately. Used to enjoy a nice steak, but it just doesn’t appeal. And… well, this is probably silly… but sometimes I crave ice. A lot of ice. Is that a problem too? Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated!
DOCTOR: Craving ice… and reduced meat intake. Alright. Any dizziness or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not unless I’m climbing stairs, and I avoid those whenever possible. Dizzy? Sometimes, when I stand up too fast. But I just hold onto something. It's old age, doctor. Everything gets a little wobbly. Look, are we getting anywhere? Because I didn't come here to list every little ache and pain. I'm tired, I crave dirt and ice, and I don’t eat much meat. Is that enough? Can we please talk about a solution? A pill, maybe?
DOCTOR: We need to rule out some things first. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to draw some blood. It's standard procedure. We need to check your iron levels, vitamin deficiencies... and other things. It will help us understand what's causing your fatigue.
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests. Of course. More poking and prodding. Honestly, you doctors always want to do everything the hard way. Fine. Get it over with. But if you find nothing wrong, I'm not staying here all day. And I still want a pill for the tiredness. Don't forget that part. Just get it done quickly, alright? I have a garden to tend to… well, I would if I had any energy.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll have a seat. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take deep breaths when I ask.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Is that deep enough? Honestly, I hate doctors. Always sticking things in your ears and prodding you. Hurry up, please. This is very undignified.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your breathing sounds slightly… diminished. Okay, now let’s move on to some blood work. I’ll need to take a sample from your arm. It will just be a little pinch.
PATIENT: Oh, elevated heart rate? Well, no wonder, being poked and prodded like this! Just get it over with. I don't faint easily, if that’s what you’re worried about. And please, don't use one of those big needles. I have sensitive veins. Just be quick about it. Honestly, I could be home weeding right now. Though, I suppose that’s a silly thought. I have no energy for weeding.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm. This will only take a moment. There we go… all done. Apply pressure to the site for a few minutes.
PATIENT: Ugh, that did sting a bit. There. Done. Honestly, it's just a whole lot of fuss over a little tiredness and a strange craving. Are we finally getting somewhere? When can I expect… you know… the pill? And don't tell me it's going to be a long wait for test results. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 3-5 business days to return results. Once we have those, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel. And I strongly advise you to stop consuming soil. It poses a health risk. Here are the forms. Please take these to the lab. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available.
PATIENT: Stop consuming dirt?! Honestly, you doctors and your "strongly advise." It's not like I'm enjoying eating dirt! It’s a craving, and I can't just turn it off. Fine. 3-5 business days? Honestly. I swear, the whole thing is a waste of time. And don't expect me to be happy about waiting. .
