DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, doctor. Dashevsky, you say? Hmm. Well, they sent me. Insurance people. Said I need to come get checked. Something about the mine. But I feel alright, you understand? Been working that mine for… long time. No problems. They just want to be sure, I think. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like this is a check-up requested by your insurance company related to your work at the mine. Even if you're feeling alright, it’s good to get things checked out as a precaution. It’s quite responsible of you to come in. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little bit more about what you do at the mine?
PATIENT: Responsible? Hmph. They make us do things. Lots of paperwork. Always paperwork. I operate the… the big machines. You know, the ones that lift the rocks and… and move the dirt. Underground. Dark down there. Been doing it… too many years to count, really. Heavy work. But I'm strong. Still strong. What do you need to know exactly? Don’t have time to be telling stories all day, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. I won’t keep you longer than necessary. Just trying to get a clear picture of things. You operate heavy machinery underground at the mine. That gives me a better understanding. Have you noticed any changes recently, even small ones, in how you’re feeling – anything at all that’s different from usual?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Not really. I mean, I get tired, yes. But that's from the work! Always tired after a long shift. Old age, too, I suppose. Getting old is tiring. Everything hurts a little more these days, you understand? But that’s just… life. No coughing, no… what do you call it… dizziness? No. Nothing like that. I’m alright. Really. They worry too much, those insurance people.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. So, primarily just fatigue related to the physical demands of your job and some general aches and pains with age, no new or unusual symptoms. Now, just to be comprehensive, have you had any trouble with your breathing at all?
PATIENT: Breathing? What kind of trouble? I breathe, yes. Always have. Always will, I hope. Sometimes it’s a little dusty down there, yes. Lots of dust. But I wear a mask, you understand? They make us wear a mask. A big, thick mask. It's uncomfortable, but it stops most of the dust. No trouble breathing. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Why are you asking about breathing? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s good that you use a mask. I'm asking about breathing because working in a dusty environment for a long time can sometimes lead to lung issues. It's just a routine question, Mr. Bigger. We want to make sure everything is healthy. Have you ever had any episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, or a persistent cough – even if it was a long time ago?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What does that even sound like? I don’t think so. No. Never had anything like that. Persistent cough… sometimes I cough in the morning. Everyone coughs in the morning, doesn't it? But it's just… a normal cough. Not a bad cough. Not anything to worry about. Look, I’ve been doing this work for a long time. If there was something wrong, I’d know, you understand? I'm not a fool. They just like to ask questions. Lots of questions. Wasting my time. Is there a way to hurry this up?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. I assure you, I’m trying to be as efficient as possible. It’s just important to rule out any potential issues, and it's good you've been aware of your health over the years. Let's move on to some other questions then. Have you had any chest pain at all, even if it was mild or came and went?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never had any chest pain. Not a single time. I work hard, yes. Lift heavy things. Sometimes my muscles ache, you understand? But that’s just… muscles. Not pain in my chest. My chest is strong. Still strong. I’m a strong man. I can lift… well, I don’t need to tell you how much I can lift. But it's a lot. You are asking too many questions about nothing. Is this going to take all day? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve been very clear that you're feeling well, and I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions, even if it’s been repetitive. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never been diagnosed with anything. I don’t go to the doctors. Waste of time and money. I eat my food, I work hard, I sleep when I can. That's all a man needs. No fancy diagnoses for me. I'm a simple man. They told me to come here because of the mine, yes? That's all. Are we done yet? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just tell me if I'm okay or not. Don't need a long story. Just a yes or no.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. You've stated you have no prior diagnoses and are feeling generally well. I respect that. Since your insurance company requested this check-up due to your work at the mine, and you've been working there for a long time, I would like to perform a quick physical exam and potentially order a chest X-ray just to be cautious. It's a standard procedure in these situations, and it can help us ensure there are no underlying issues related to dust exposure. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: X-ray? What for? There’s nothing wrong! You keep saying I'm fine. Now you want to… shine lights at my chest? Sounds silly. I don't want any lights shining at my chest. I'm a strong man. I don't need to be poked and prodded and… x-rayed. No. I don't want any X-rays. It won't change anything. You are wasting my time. I think I’m done here. I'm leaving. Tell the insurance people I said I don’t need it. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please, sit down for just a moment. I understand your reluctance, but the X-ray isn't to suggest anything is wrong. It’s a preventative measure, a standard practice when there’s been prolonged dust exposure. It gives us a baseline for your lung health. If you are unwilling to have an X-ray, I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Without it, it’s difficult for me to fulfill the requirements of your insurance company’s check-up and ensure your long-term health. I can document your refusal, but I must advise you that this may impact your coverage. Would you like me to explain the potential implications in more detail?
PATIENT: Implications? Coverage? You are just trying to scare me now. No, I don’t want to hear about implications. I’m a simple man. I don’t understand all these fancy words and… and rules. I told you, I feel alright. Been working that mine for… too long to count. If something was wrong, I’d know. I don’t need a machine to tell me what I already know. Just… write down whatever you need to write down. I’m not doing any X-rays. I’m leaving now. You are wasting my time, and frankly, you are being disrespectful. I came here because they made me. Now I’m leaving. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I understand your decision, and I respect it. I will document your refusal of the chest X-ray in your chart. Before you go, I would like to provide you with some information about the symptoms of lung disease, just in case you experience any changes in the future. And I strongly encourage you to consider regular check-ups with a physician, even if you're feeling well. Here is a brochure with some helpful information. Please take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Hmph. .
