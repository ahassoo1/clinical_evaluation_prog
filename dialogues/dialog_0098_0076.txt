DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my legs, see? They got these… bumps. Red ones. On my shins, mostly. Been bothering me a little bit lately. Not terrible, but enough to make me wonder.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins. I see. And how long have these bumps been bothering you, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not too long, I don’t think. Maybe a month? A little over? It started slow, just one or two. I didn't think much of it at first, figured I bumped into something. But then more showed up, and they… well, they don't go away.
DOCTOR: A month or so. And they’re not going away… Alright. Are they itchy, painful, or are they more just… visible?
PATIENT: They’re not really itchy. More… sore, if I press on ‘em. Not like a sharp pain, just… tender. And yeah, very visible, especially when I’m wearing shorts. My wife noticed right away, she always does.
DOCTOR: Good to have a good observer! Okay, tenderness to the touch. Have you noticed anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I haven’t really tried anything, to be honest. I figured they’d just go away on their own. Nothing seems to make ‘em worse, like walking or anything. And nothing makes ‘em better, either. I haven’t put any creams or anything on ‘em. Maybe that’s what I shoulda done?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, no need to apologize. We'll figure it out. And it's good you haven’t put anything on them yet, that can sometimes make it harder to tell what’s going on. Now, let’s talk about your medical history for a bit. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I got Medicare, so I see doctors now and then. Mostly just for check-ups, you know? Old age catching up to me. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they got it under control with pills. Aside from that… nothing much, I think. My wife handles most of the remembering, to be honest. She'll probably know more than me, if you ever need to ask her.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure, currently controlled with medication. That's good to know. And you said your wife handles a lot of the remembering, that’s very helpful. We may need to check her records as well, if that’s alright with you. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes. When I was younger, I broke my arm playing basketball. Had surgery to set it, I think. A long time ago. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it, I believe. Nothing recent. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Broken arm, appendix removal… Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My wife’s family is healthy, mostly. Her mother lived a long life, thankfully. My side… my mother had some trouble with her legs when she got older. Swelling, mostly. And my brother… he had diabetes, but that was a long time ago. He passed away a few years back. Not sure if that's related to your bumps or not. I'm not a doctor, you know? Just trying to remember what I can.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's helpful information either way. And we’ll take everything into consideration. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the blood pressure pill, I think. A little white one. I take it every morning with breakfast. And… sometimes I take something for my joints. They ache now and then, especially when it's cold. But that's just an over-the-counter thing, you know? Like ibuprofen. I don’t take it every day. Only when I really need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication daily and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. No, I don't think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffles sometimes with the pollen, but that's just normal, right? Nothing serious. My wife could probably tell you for sure, she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Aluia, that's a lot of helpful information. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to take a look at your legs. Can you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. That sounds good. Hope these old legs aren't too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Aluia. We’ll take it slow. First, I'm just going to take a look and feel the bumps. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender. Hmm. They are a bit warm to the touch, and definitely tender. They're mostly on the front of your shins, and they appear to be… small, raised bumps, slightly red. No signs of any open sores or blisters. Is it always this tender, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It's pretty much always this tender, Doctor. Not like a sharp pain, more like… a constant soreness. Sometimes it feels a little worse after I’ve been walking a lot, but even when I’m just sitting here, it’s still a little uncomfortable. My wife says they look a little inflamed, she's good at noticing these things. Feels a bit… achy, too, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant soreness, slightly achy, and your wife notes some inflammation. And you mentioned you were walking a lot recently?
PATIENT: Not that much more than usual, Doctor. I walk around the neighborhood every day, just to keep the legs moving, you know? About a mile or so. Did that the day before yesterday, and yesterday. Nothing special. Same route, same pace. Just trying to stay active. I've been doing it for years, so I figured it couldn't be that. But maybe… maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. Based on what you've told me and my examination, these bumps could be shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome. It’s common with increased activity, even if it’s not a dramatic increase. The soreness and tenderness along the shinbone are typical symptoms. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a simple blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any other underlying conditions. And I recommend resting your legs for a few days, applying ice packs for 15-20 minutes at a time several times a day, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, as you’ve been doing, to manage the discomfort. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Shin splints… Hmm. Never heard of ‘em before, but if that's what it is, I guess that makes sense. Resting and ice… yeah, I can do that. I'll skip the walking for a few days. And the ibuprofen is fine, I’ve got some at home. Blood test… yeah, that sounds good too, Doctor. Better safe than sorry, right? So, just rest, ice, and pills… and get some blood work done. That doesn't sound too bad. When can I get the blood work done? And will you tell me what the results mean?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Rest, ice, and ibuprofen. And yes, we'll get the blood work done right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they're expecting you. I'll have the results sent to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, typically within a week. If the pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any fever, redness, or swelling around your legs, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything, Doctor. Just rest, ice, pills, blood work… and call if it gets worse. Got it. Thank you very much. You've been a big help. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my legs and tell me what's going on. I'll go get that blood work done now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I’m glad I could help. Please let the front desk know you’re here for your blood work. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
