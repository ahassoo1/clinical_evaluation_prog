DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it’s about… the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here you were referred to me regarding a cancer diagnosis. That must be a lot to process. Can you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: It is… a lot. My husband… he passed away from it last year. And then… I found out it was in me too, a few months ago. They… they told me what kind, but I don’t really remember all the words. Something about… cells? It’s all been a blur, honestly. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with… details right now.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you're overwhelmed, Chellsea. It’s okay not to remember everything, especially with everything you’ve been through. Losing your husband and then receiving this news… that's incredibly difficult. We’ll take things slowly. Do you remember where the cancer is located in your body?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. It’s in my… chest. They said… lung. It's in my lung. And… they found some in my bones too, I believe. It’s all very frightening, Doctor. I don’t… I don’t know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, lung cancer with bone involvement. I understand your fear, Chellsea. That is a lot to take in. Do you know what type of lung cancer it is?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. They said a lot of things… small cell? Non-small cell? I just… I wasn’t really listening, I think. I was too busy trying not to cry. Is that bad? I should probably remember these things, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: No, that is not bad at all. It's perfectly normal to have trouble processing information when you're under this kind of stress. We have your pathology reports here, so we can look at the specific type. Okay, it says here you have Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with bone metastasis. Do you want me to explain what that means?
PATIENT: Stage IV… That sounds… serious. And metastasis… is that when it spreads? I’m sorry, I feel like I should know all of this. What does it mean for me? What… what happens next?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Stage IV means the cancer has spread beyond the lung to other parts of the body, in your case, to the bones. Metastasis is the spread of cancer. It's a serious diagnosis, Chellsea, but it doesn't mean there are no options. We have several treatment approaches we can consider, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and palliative care to manage symptoms. The goal of treatment will depend on several factors, including your overall health, the specific characteristics of your cancer, and your preferences. Before we talk about specific treatments, I'd like to get a better understanding of your medical history. Have you had any other significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… I had pneumonia a few years ago. And… I broke my wrist when I was younger, playing basketball. Nothing major, I don’t think. Other than that… I’ve always been pretty healthy. My husband… he had heart problems, though. That’s why he… I have Medicare, if that matters. And… I get a little tired, easily. But I figured that was just… everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Chellsea. It’s helpful to know. And yes, Medicare will be important when it comes to treatment options. Fatigue is a common symptom with cancer and can be caused by the disease itself or the treatments. Have you had any surgeries in the past besides the broken wrist?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the wrist, when I was a teenager. They just… put a cast on it. It healed fine. I… I don’t really have a very good memory for things like that. My husband always remembered all of my doctor’s appointments and things. I just… went along with him. I’m sorry, I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Chellsea. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and not remember everything. We’ll piece it together. It’s okay. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… breast cancer, I think. A long time ago. And… my uncle, I think, he had something too. But I don’t know what kind. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. It’s a… complicated family. My mother and her siblings… they don’t really keep in touch. I’m sorry, that’s probably not very useful information.
DOCTOR: That is useful. It’s good to know about the breast cancer in your grandmother. Knowing family history can sometimes help us understand your risk and guide treatment decisions. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked, for a while, but I always made him go outside. I hated it. I didn’t want him to get sick. It… it didn't help, though. I drink… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing too much. And… I don’t really do much else. I used to like to garden, but… after my husband passed… I haven't really had the energy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Chellsea. It’s helpful to have a full picture. And it’s completely understandable that you haven’t been able to do the things you enjoy after such a loss. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had any reactions to anything. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Until… now. I think that’s everything? I’m sorry if I’m rambling. I feel like I’m just… going around in circles.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Chellsea. You've given me a lot of valuable information. It sounds like you've been through a tremendous amount, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your current condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. I guess. I just… I hope it won’t be too long. I get a little anxious in these situations. But… yes, okay. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take it slowly, and I'll explain everything as we go. Okay, deep breath in… and out… again… I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. This is consistent with fluid or a blockage, which could be related to the cancer. I'm also going to listen to your heart. Your heart sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to feel your lymph nodes in your neck, armpits, and groin to check for any swelling. I do feel some slight swelling in the lymph nodes on the right side of your neck. Again, this is something we'll need to investigate further. Finally, I'm going to check your overall neurological function with a few simple tests. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, squeeze my hand, and wiggle your toes. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that’s alright. Is… is everything okay? The swelling… that sounds bad, doesn’t it? I’m getting a little worried now. What does it mean?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Chellsea. The swelling in the lymph nodes can be a sign that the cancer has spread, but it can also be caused by other things, like infection. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine the cause. Your neurological function appears normal, which is good. Based on the information we have so far, I recommend we order a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to get a better understanding of the extent of the cancer. We’ll also need to do a biopsy of the swollen lymph nodes to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of cancer cells. Would you like me to explain those tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A CT scan… and a biopsy? What exactly do those involve? And… will they hurt? I’m not very good with… procedures. I just… I want to know what to expect. The more I know, the less scared I’ll be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious. Let’s talk about the tests. A CT scan is a type of X-ray that takes detailed pictures of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s painless, but you’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes while the pictures are taken. Sometimes, we give a contrast dye through an IV to help the pictures be clearer. The dye can cause a warm sensation, but it’s usually well-tolerated. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the swollen lymph nodes to examine under a microscope. This will help us confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of cancer cells. We can do this in a couple of ways. A fine needle aspiration involves using a thin needle to collect a sample. It’s relatively painless, but you may feel a slight pinch. Or, we can do an excisional biopsy, which involves removing the entire lymph node. This requires a small incision and local anesthesia, so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. We'll discuss which biopsy method is best for you. Both procedures are generally safe, but there are always some risks involved, like bleeding, infection, or pain. We’ll take every precaution to minimize those risks. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. A CT scan sounds… okay. Not pleasant, but manageable. The biopsy… that sounds a little scary, though. Especially the incision. But I understand why it’s important. Okay. Let’s do the tests. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to know what I’m fighting against. And I want to get started. The sooner we know, the sooner we can… do something. What happens after the tests? How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very brave attitude, Chellsea. I completely understand your desire to get started. Okay, I’ll order the CT scan and schedule you for a biopsy appointment. The CT scan should be scheduled within the next couple of days, and the results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. The biopsy appointment will likely be within the next week. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan that’s tailored to your specific needs. This might include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these treatments. We’ll also talk about palliative care to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. I’ll also refer you to an oncologist who specializes in lung cancer. They’ll be your main point of contact for treatment. I'll be here to support you every step of the way, of course. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything, for now. Just… thank you. For explaining everything so clearly. And for being so… patient. I’m still trying to wrap my head around all of this. I guess… I’ll just wait for the phone call. And try to stay positive. It’s hard, though. It’s really hard.
DOCTOR: It is hard, Chellsea. And it's okay to not be positive all the time. It’s okay to be scared, angry, or sad. Allow yourself to feel those emotions. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you to schedule the tests. She’s wonderful and can answer any questions you might have. Remember, you’re not alone in this. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your appointments. Take care of yourself, Chellsea.
