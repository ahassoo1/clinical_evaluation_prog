DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 58 years of age. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Fifty-eight. Seems right, I think. Lots of birthdays, you know? I… moved here. New place. Just need to… check things. For the old people’s insurance. Medicare, it is. They said I need to see someone. A doctor. You? You are the doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, I am your doctor. It appears Medicare requires a comprehensive check-up for new residents. “Check things,” you say. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? You ask too many questions. I do makeup. For the… stage. Actors. Beautiful people. But… I feel okay. Mostly. Old, of course. But okay. Is that specific enough? It’s just… a check. They want a check. I don’t feel sick.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re a makeup artist for actors, and you're here for a routine check-up as requested by Medicare. It's good to know you feel generally well. However, a “check-up” involves more than simply feeling okay, Mr. Szmyd. To ensure a thorough evaluation, I need to ask you some questions regarding your medical history. Have you experienced any changes in your health recently – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Everything is… slower. Everything is slow these days. Walking… takes longer. And remembering… Forgetful. Very forgetful. But that’s just… old age, yes? I don’t think it’s a change. It's always been this way. A little slower, a little forgetful. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: I understand. You've noticed a gradual slowing down and some forgetfulness. It is helpful to establish a baseline, Mr. Szmyd. Now, concerning this forgetfulness - would you describe it as simply misplacing things, or are you experiencing difficulty recalling recent events, perhaps names or conversations?
PATIENT: Oh, both. Definitely both. The keys… always the keys. And names… faces… I see them, but the name… gone. Like smoke. Yesterday… what did I even do yesterday? I think… I think I went to the store. Maybe. Or did I just watch television? It all blends together. It's… annoying, honestly. A beautiful face, a perfect lipstick... much easier to remember that.
DOCTOR: I see. Misplacing items, difficulty recalling recent events and names – a blending of days, as you put it. This is… concerning. Now, has anyone else noticed these changes in your memory, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Noticed? My ex-wife? She would have loved to notice. Always looking for something wrong. No. Nobody notices. I live alone. Actors are… self-absorbed. They don’t care if I remember their names, just if I make them look good. No, nobody notices. And frankly, I don't bother telling them.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Szmyd, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh, dear. That’s… a long time ago. I… I think… maybe something with my blood? When I was younger. The doctor in Russia… he said something. But it was… a long time ago. I don’t remember the words. Not important. I was healthy, mostly. Worked hard. Always busy. Did lots of faces.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you recall where in Russia you received medical care?
PATIENT: Russia… oh, so long ago. A small town. Near… near the water, I think. A big hospital. White walls. Lots of… stern-looking doctors. But the name… the town… it’s gone. Like everything else. It was a long, long time ago. Before… before everything. Is it important? I don't understand why we need to know all of this.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Szmyd. Knowing your past medical history helps me understand your current health and ensure I’m providing you with the best possible care. Even vague recollections can be helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’m too… delicate. For makeup. Can't have scars. And hospital? No. I avoid hospitals. Bad smells, unhappy people. No. Never been in a hospital. I take care of myself. Mostly. A little slower now, a little forgetful, but… no hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't like pills. They make me feel… strange. Vitamins, maybe? Sometimes. My neighbor gives me things. Little colorful pills. But I forget to take them half the time. No, not really. I prefer a good cream. For the face. Much better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to ask about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, such as pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Dust, maybe. Makes me sneeze. And… some creams. Cheap creams. Make my skin itchy. But serious allergies? No. I’m Russian. We are strong. We don’t have allergies. We have vodka.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Szmyd, before we proceed, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical… examination? I suppose. What choice do I have? You’re the doctor. But don't poke too hard. I have delicate skin. And please, no cold instruments. I hate cold instruments. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148 over 92. Your pulse is 78, regular. Your temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, if you could please remove your shirt and lie back, I will listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Remove my… shirt? In here? Oh, no. Absolutely not. I am a professional! I do not… expose myself. You can listen to my heart through my shirt. It’s perfectly fine. I assure you. Much more… civilized.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. We will proceed as you wish. Your heart sounds… regular, but slightly muffled due to clothing. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are somewhat diminished. I note you appear somewhat cachectic – you seem to have lost some weight. And your gait, as you walked in, appeared slightly unsteady. Now, I'm concerned about your reported memory loss, elevated blood pressure, diminished lung sounds, and weight loss. I recommend some further testing, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CT scan of the brain to rule out any underlying causes for your memory loss. Would you be agreeable to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? A CT scan? Of my… brain? Absolutely not! That sounds… frightening. And expensive. I don't need tests. I just need… a little rest. And maybe a good cream. I am perfectly fine. It’s just old age. You keep asking questions and wanting to poke and prod. No. No tests. I think I will find another doctor. One who understands… a professional like myself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. These tests are important for your health and well-being. Without them, we cannot accurately determine the cause of your symptoms. I am concerned about your memory loss and other health issues, and I believe further investigation is crucial. However, ultimately, the decision is yours. If you change your mind, please do not hesitate to contact me. I wish you good health.
PATIENT: Fine. Good day. I think I need a nap. And a good cream. Perhaps several.
