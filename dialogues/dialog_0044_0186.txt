DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Uh, I'm here for a tryout. For a team. They said I needed to get checked out first, make sure I'm... you know... still in good enough shape. It's a sports thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark, that’s good to know. A pre-participation physical, excellent. That’s a smart idea. Which sport are you trying out for, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Mongolian wrestling. It's... well, it's a bit different than what you might be used to. Lots of grabbing, and... throwing. Not exactly football, you know?
DOCTOR: No, I can imagine! It’s quite a bit different than most sports I see here. Though, honestly, any sport requires a good level of physical fitness and can put stress on the body in unique ways. So, we’ll make sure you’re cleared for it. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Not really. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. Probably ten years? Maybe more. I usually just… tough it out, you know? When something hurts, I rest it. I don't really bother with doctors unless something is really broken. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Lamark. A lot of people feel that way. But it’s good you’re getting it checked out now, especially before starting a new physical activity. We want to make sure there aren't any underlying issues we need to be aware of. Okay. So, in the past ten years or so, have you had any serious illnesses, like pneumonia, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had the flu once, maybe five years ago? It was bad for a week, but I got over it. Other than that... no. Nothing major. I've sprained an ankle a few times wrestling, but I always healed. Honestly, I'm pretty tough.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And it's good you've been able to recover well from those sprains. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Nope. Nothing like that either. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. A few bruises, a few aches, but never anything that needed a doctor… or a hospital. I just rub some cream on it and keep going. Well, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or close relatives – has any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: Um... my father, he had… problems with his breathing, when he was older. I think it was his lungs. He smoked a lot. Other than that… not really. My mother was healthy, I think. And I don't really know much about my grandparents. They lived far away. I'm not sure. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lamark. It’s common to not have all the details. Knowing about your father’s lung issues is good information, though. It can give us a better idea of potential risks. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always stayed away from that. Too hard on the lungs, you know? Especially for wrestling. Can't be winded every five minutes. My father… well, he was a warning, if you get what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Lamark. That's very good. And a very wise decision. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not a lot. Maybe a beer with friends after a match. Nothing crazy. Not every week, maybe once a month? It doesn't bother me, I don't think. I don't get drunk or anything. Just relax, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just rub some cream on it, like I said. I try to stay natural, if you get what I mean? Keep it simple. No fancy stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints, just to make sure everything is working as it should. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just... try to make it quick, if you don't mind. I'm kind of eager to get started with the tryouts, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let's just get you to take a few deep breaths for me. Take a deep breath in... and out... good. And again... and out... Okay, everything sounds clear so far. Your heart rate is a little elevated, which is understandable if you're a bit anxious about the tryout, but nothing concerning. Blood pressure is 130/85. A little on the higher side, but not alarming. Now, let’s check your reflexes...
PATIENT: Ow! Okay, okay. It jumped, didn't it? I'm not very good with this sort of thing. I spend most of my time wrestling, not… getting tapped with hammers.
DOCTOR: It did jump, yes. That’s perfectly normal. Just making sure your nerves are responding as they should. Now, let's take a look at your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: There. It's a little stiff. Old wrestling injury, I think. Nothing major. I can still move it, see? Still works.
DOCTOR: I see. And can you rotate your ankles?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. No problem. Is that enough? I mean, I'm a wrestler, not a ballerina.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good for now. Everything seems relatively normal, with a slight stiffness in your right knee, as you mentioned. Given your history and the physical exam, I’d recommend getting an X-ray of your right knee just to rule out any underlying issues. It's a precaution, nothing to be alarmed about. Also, your blood pressure is a little elevated. I’d like you to monitor it at home for a week and keep a record. If it remains consistently high, we should discuss further evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Really? Okay, fine. Whatever you think is best. And… monitoring my blood pressure? I don’t even have a blood pressure monitor. This is getting complicated. Look, I just want to wrestle. Is this going to stop me from trying out?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lamark. I don't want to stop you from trying out at all. The X-ray and blood pressure monitoring are just precautions to ensure your safety and prevent any potential problems down the line. The X-ray will help rule out any structural issues in your knee that might be causing the stiffness. And monitoring your blood pressure will give us a better understanding of your overall cardiovascular health. I can write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. They are relatively inexpensive and easy to use. And I can give you a referral to a local radiology center for the X-ray. You can schedule the appointment at your convenience. The results of the X-ray and your blood pressure readings will help me determine if you are fit to participate in wrestling without any restrictions. If everything looks good, you should be able to try out without any issues. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Okay. A monitor and an X-ray. It's a lot, but… I guess. Just… write it all down. The fastest way. I don’t want to spend all day filling out forms. And can I get this referral now? I need to get this done so I can… wrestle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here is the prescription for the home blood pressure monitor. You can pick it up at any pharmacy. And here’s the referral to the radiology center. They should be able to schedule an appointment for you quickly. I'll also print out some instructions on how to properly monitor your blood pressure at home. Please bring the results of the X-ray and a week's worth of blood pressure readings to your follow-up appointment with me. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain in your knee, or if your blood pressure readings are consistently high – over 140/90 – please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that's everything. I just... need to get this done. So I can wrestle. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lamark. I wish you the best of luck with your tryouts. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Take care, and remember to prioritize your health. .
