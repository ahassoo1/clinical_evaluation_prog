DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, I haven’t got all day. It’s this tiredness. It’s just…getting worse. And it’s…well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Clay, mostly. Don’t look at me like that. It’s not like I want to, it just…happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. No need to be embarrassed, Candis. We’re here to figure things out, and I appreciate you being honest with me. That’s the most important thing. “Tiredness getting worse,” and…you’ve been ingesting clay. Alright. Just to be clear, when you say it “just happens,” can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's like…a craving. A really strong one. It started a few months ago, just little bits, you know? Now…now I find myself looking for it. It’s not like I’m going out of my way, but if I see some good-looking dirt…I just…have to. It makes my mouth water, honestly. It's ridiculous. And it doesn't help with the tiredness, obviously. Makes my stomach a bit upset too, sometimes. But I can't seem to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, a craving that started a few months ago, progressing to a point where you actively find yourself wanting it, despite it causing stomach upset. And it's not relieving the tiredness, you said. Just out of curiosity, Candis, what does the dirt taste like to you?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t make me think about it! It’s…earthy, obviously. Kind of cool and smooth. And…salty? Not like table salt, but…mineral-y. It's hard to explain. Look, I'm not a geologist, okay? I just know when I see a good patch. It’s…satisfying. But then I feel awful afterwards. It's a vicious cycle, I tell you. Why am I even telling you this? It's humiliating.
DOCTOR: You’re not humiliating yourself at all, Candis. You’re telling me what’s going on, and that’s incredibly brave. We need to understand what’s driving this craving, and the more details you can give me, the better. "Earthy, cool, smooth, mineral-y..." Okay. And you mentioned it started a few months ago. Has anything changed in your life around that time?
PATIENT: Ugh, changed? Let me think… Not really. Same old, same old. I work at the clinic, helping people with their exercises, you know? Physical Therapy Aides. It’s…fine. I live alone, always have. No husband, no kids. I eat…well, I try to eat healthy. I haven't been travelling or anything. Nothing exciting ever happens to me. It just…started. Maybe the weather? It was a damp spring. Do you think that could be it?
DOCTOR: A damp spring is a possibility, though not usually the primary cause. You've been working at the clinic, same routine… living alone. And you try to maintain a healthy diet. Now, Candis, have you noticed any other unusual cravings lately?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do I look like I snack on rocks all day? No! Just the dirt. Honestly, it's embarrassing enough talking about this, let alone listing off all my weird food habits. I eat…normal things. Toast, sometimes. Soup. Fruit when it's in season. Look, I’m a perfectly sensible woman, usually. This is just…a phase, right? It’ll go away? It has to.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. It is unusual, and it's perfectly normal to want it to just go away. And you do sound like a perfectly sensible woman. We'll try to figure out why this is happening. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you been feeling any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and the craving?
PATIENT: Ugh, other symptoms... well, I've been a bit weak, I suppose. Like I don't have much energy. And...sometimes I get a little dizzy. Not falling-down dizzy, just...lightheaded. Oh, and my nails have been…brittle. Breaking all the time. I figured it was just getting old. What does it matter? I’m seventy-nine, for goodness sake. Things fall apart. This is just another thing. It’s not like anyone cares about my nails.
DOCTOR: Seventy-nine is still young at heart, Candis! And yes, these details matter very much. Weakness, dizziness, and brittle nails... those could be connected to what's going on. Now, Candis, have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Ugh, appetite… No, not really. I eat when I'm hungry, don't eat when I'm not. I don't have one of those fancy diets. Sometimes I skip a meal if I'm busy, sometimes I have a bigger one. Nothing unusual. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’ve told you everything. Can we just get this over with? I have errands to run. And I really don't want to talk about dirt anymore. It's disgusting. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis, I understand your frustration. We’ve covered a lot, and I appreciate your patience. Before we move on, just a couple more quick questions, and then we can discuss some possibilities and a plan. Have you been taking any medications or supplements lately?
