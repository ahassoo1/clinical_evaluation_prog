DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... lab work, I think? The lady on the phone said something about it. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just need what they sent me for, if that’s alright. The quicker we can get it done, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. It’s perfectly alright – many things can affect our memory as we get older. It sounds like you’re here for some routine blood work, as scheduled. Before we proceed, though, could you tell me a little bit about why the blood work was ordered?
PATIENT: Routine… right. Honestly, I don’t recall who ordered it or why. Something about the power plant, maybe? I used to work there, you know. For a long time. They probably just want to make sure I haven't… grown extra heads or something. It’s all a blur, though. Really. Is it important? Can't we just do the tests?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Croonquist, though I understand your frustration. Knowing why the tests were ordered helps me interpret the results accurately and ensure we’re looking for the right things. Your work at the power plant could be relevant, certainly. To clarify, did a doctor specifically request these tests, or was it a requirement from your former employer?
PATIENT: Employer, I think. Yes, definitely the employer. Something about… safety checks, I vaguely remember. They do those, right? Every so often. Look, I'm not a doctor, I just... worked the buttons. Big buttons. Lots of them. Is there a form I signed? Maybe that'll jog my memory. This is all… a bit much.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me take a look in your chart, Mr. Croonquist. Ah, yes. It appears these tests are part of a routine follow-up, as required by the power plant’s health and safety protocols, following your retirement. It’s a standard practice for employees who worked in specific roles. The request specifies a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Do you have any known allergies or medications you are currently taking that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Maybe a bit sniffly in the spring, but that's just dust, I think. Medications… hmm. Let me think. The little blue pill. For… well, for getting to sleep. And sometimes, something for my knees. They ache, you know. Old age. What were the names of those pills…? Honestly, it’s all a jumble. I really wish someone had just told me what they wanted before I came all the way here. It’s a long drive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Croonquist. It's easy to forget these details, especially when dealing with multiple medications. The “little blue pill” is likely a sleep aid, and we can certainly look into the name of the one for your knees. For the record, do you remember who prescribed those medications?
PATIENT: Who prescribed them… Doctor Henderson, maybe? Or was it Dr. Phillips? They all look the same after a while, you know. Old faces. I saw a lot of doctors in my time. Mostly just for check-ups. They poke and prod, and then I leave. Honestly, I can't be sure. Is it vital? Can we just... skip this part and get the blood drawn? I have an appointment later this afternoon. A very important appointment. I can’t be late.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Croonquist. Knowing the prescribing doctor would be helpful, but it’s not critical at this moment. We can attempt to verify the medication names through your pharmacy records later, if necessary. Before we proceed with the blood work, let me just ask a few quick questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Changes... hmm. Weight? Maybe a little less. Everything tastes like cardboard these days, so my appetite isn’t what it used to be. And energy… well, I mostly just sit around. Read the paper. Try to remember things. The energy’s gone, that’s for sure. It all comes and goes, you know. One day I feel okay, the next… not so much. It’s just getting old, Doctor. Just getting old. Can we please just get this over with? I really don’t like needles. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll get this done as quickly and comfortably as possible. Your concerns are perfectly valid. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is excellent. She'll be in shortly. Before she arrives, let me just quickly review the physical exam. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at the moment. Your pulse is 72 and regular. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. I’ll also check your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical, which is normal. Everything seems within normal limits at this point. Now, let’s get those labs drawn, and we can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Sarah will be right with you. .
