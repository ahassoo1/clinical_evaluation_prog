DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t really have time for this whole…chat. Just need to get it over with. It’s my stomach, alright? Bloated. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball. Been happening a bit lately. Honestly, I just want something to fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand you want to get this sorted quickly. “Bloated stomach, happening lately.” Can you tell me a little more about when it started, and how often it’s been happening?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start? Honestly…not sure. Weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It's not constant, if that makes a difference. Look, I work long hours, alright? Pile driving, out in the sun… I don’t exactly have time to keep a diary of my…digestive issues. Does it matter when exactly it started? It’s happening now, that’s what matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, “happening now” is a good start. And you mentioned long hours, pile driving… is it worse after a particularly strenuous day?
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. When I really push myself, it's…more noticeable. More uncomfortable, I mean. It’s just… swelling, pressure. Like I ate way too much, even when I haven’t. Honestly, I don't see what a job has to do with my stomach. It’s probably just… something I ate. Or stress, I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? Look, I told you, it bloats. That's the main thing. I haven’t got…diarrhea or anything. No pain, really, just…pressure. Maybe a bit gassy, but everyone’s gassy, right? I’m not about to list everything I eat and feel, Doc. I just want something to take for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no diarrhea, just pressure and gas with the bloating. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – are you going more or less frequently than usual?
PATIENT: Bowel…habits? Seriously? Look, I go when I need to go. That's it. Haven't exactly been tracking it, alright? I'm a grown man, not a baby. It’s…normal, I guess? Look, can we just skip the personal questions and get to the…solution? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your time is valuable. Let’s try this. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No. No throwing up. No feeling sick. Just…full. And uncomfortable. Like there's something stuck, even when there isn’t. Honestly, Doc, I’m starting to feel like you’re deliberately trying to waste my time. I came here for a quick fix, not a…stomach interrogation.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Look, I eat. I eat when I'm hungry. Mostly…whatever’s quick, alright? Sandwiches, sometimes burgers, leftovers from my wife… used to be leftovers from my wife. It’s not fancy. I don’t have time to cook. What does my diet have to do with feeling like a balloon? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, and I want to help. But to give you the right solution, I need to understand what might be causing this. Alright. Last question for now. Any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Maybe… a little? I haven't weighed myself in ages, to be honest. Probably…lost a bit. It's hard to say. Everything's been…difficult since my wife passed. I'm just… not as focused on things like that anymore. Can we please just get to the part where you give me something to take?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I appreciate you sharing that. We'll try to get this sorted. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. I've got a job to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now… sounds are present, though a bit…hypoactive. Palpating… some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No obvious masses or organomegaly. Your abdomen is slightly distended, which correlates with your feeling of bloating.
PATIENT: Distended? Look, I told you I feel like a balloon, alright? What does "hypoactive" even mean? And what are you writing down? Look, Doc, I'm a simple man. Is it something serious? Just tell me straight. Is it cancer or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your concern. "Hypoactive" means your bowel sounds are a little quieter than usual, which isn’t necessarily alarming on its own. And no, based on this initial exam, I don't believe it’s cancer. However, given the bloating, the tenderness, and the slight weight loss you mentioned, I want to rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count , a metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for any inflammation or infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Look, I really don't have time for tests, Doc. Can't you just…give me something for the gas? Something to calm my stomach? I've got deadlines, alright? People are counting on me. This is going to take weeks, isn’t it? I knew I shouldn’t have bothered coming in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you I'm not trying to delay things unnecessarily. But to give you a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, we need to have a clearer picture of what's going on. These tests are relatively straightforward and will help us rule out any serious underlying causes. I'll order them now, and we can get them scheduled as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I can prescribe you an over-the-counter medication like simethicone to help with the gas and bloating, but that's only a temporary solution. It’s important to address the root cause of the problem. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Just…get it over with. Simethicone or whatever. But I’m telling you, Doc, if this takes longer than a week, I’m not coming back. And I expect a straight answer, no more medical mumbo jumbo. Can we get this done now? I've got a job to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Here's the prescription for simethicone. You can pick it up at your usual pharmacy. And here's the requisition for the blood work and stool sample. You can take this to the lab down the street, and they should be able to get you scheduled quickly. The results will take a few days to come back. I'll have the nurse give you instructions for the stool sample collection. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and determine the best course of action. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…get me out of here. .
