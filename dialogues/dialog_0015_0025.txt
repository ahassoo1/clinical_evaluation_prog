DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Laury, please. I want to… find out more about where I come from. My family, I mean. I hear you can do tests with… DNA? To see who your people are, long time ago?
DOCTOR: DNA ancestry tests, you mean. Yes, I’m aware of them. However, this isn't typically a service offered within a standard medical practice, Mr. Scobie. My focus is on your health and wellbeing currently. While understanding your heritage is…interesting, it doesn’t directly address any medical concerns. Are you experiencing any symptoms that prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: No symptoms, Doctor. I'm… pretty good for my age, I think. It’s just… always wanted to know. My grandpa, he told stories about the islands… but stories change, you know? I thought maybe this test could… make it clearer? Not for sickness, just… who I am. I have Medicare, is that okay?
DOCTOR: Medicare coverage for ancestry testing is… complicated, to say the least. It generally isn’t covered unless it’s directly related to a medical condition – for example, if you needed genetic testing to determine a predisposition to a hereditary disease that's common in a specific population. Look, Mr. Scobie, I understand your curiosity. But frankly, pursuing this through a medical visit feels… inappropriate. There are commercial companies that specialize in these tests. I can provide you with a list if you’d like, but it won’t be something I can facilitate here. Before we conclude, are you sure there's nothing else bothering you?
PATIENT: Commercial companies? You mean… I have to pay them? Hmm. That’s… not so good. I thought maybe as a doctor… you could help. No, nothing else. Just the family. Always wondered. Thank you for listening, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Scobie. As I said, my area of expertise lies in healthcare. Paying for a private company is, unfortunately, the standard route for these types of genealogical inquiries. Now, if you are certain there are no health concerns we need to address today, I will document this visit as a discussion regarding ancestry testing. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Just… a talk. Thank you, Doctor Trestrail. I… appreciate your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Scobie. I wish you well in your search. Please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment if any medical issues arise in the future. Goodbye. .
