DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, doc, I don't have all day to sit here and explain everything. It's this tiredness. Just dragging. And… well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just need it. It sounds ridiculous, I know.
DOCTOR: Right. "Dragging," you say. And you’ve been… consuming soil?
PATIENT: Yes, soil! Clay, mostly. Red clay, if I can get it. It just… feels right, you know? Like something’s missing. And don't look at me like that. I’m a perfectly sensible woman. It’s just... a habit. A bad habit. But it’s not helping this tiredness, that’s for sure. I’ve tried to stop, but… well, it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Sensible or not, Ms. Hardenburgh, eating soil is… unusual. And potentially dangerous. We need to figure out why you're feeling this urge, and why you're so tired. Let's start with the tiredness. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, now. Maybe six months? It comes and goes, but it’s been getting worse lately. I used to be able to push through it, you know? Garden, keep up with things… now? I just want to lie down. It’s not like I’m doing anything to cause it. I don’t understand it. And honestly, I don't have time for this weakness. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it's interfering with your daily activities. Alright. And you said you've tried to stop the soil consumption?
PATIENT: Tried is a strong word. I think about stopping. I tell myself I shouldn’t. But then I get this… feeling. A craving, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. Like something’s missing inside, and the clay fills it up. Not a good feeling, don't get me wrong, but better than the emptiness. It's just... easier to give in. I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. It’s embarrassing!
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's important to be honest with me, even about things you find embarrassing. This craving… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Worse when I'm really tired, I think. And when I’m stressed. Although, what isn’t stressful these days? It’s not like I’m going out and digging up fancy soil, if that's what you're thinking. Just… little bits, here and there. From my garden, mostly. Though sometimes I… well, I've been getting it from a patch down by the creek. Don't judge me, doc. I’m not proud of it, but it’s easier to find there.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging you, Ms. Hardenburgh. We need to understand what's driving this behavior. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Well, I’ve been more… forgetful, I suppose. Not like serious forgetful, but… misplacing things. Not remembering what I went into the kitchen for. Little things. And… I don't know… my appetite hasn't been great. Food just doesn't taste the same. It's probably just old age, honestly. Everything goes when you get to be my age. Is this going anywhere, doc? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Ms. Hardenburgh. Forgetfulness and decreased appetite… those are important details. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work, if that's alright. It'll help us rule out some potential causes for your fatigue and… unusual habit. Just a basic check, nothing too invasive. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… I feel like a child. And blood work? Goodness. I hate needles. But… if it gets me out of here faster, alright. Just be quick about it, will you? I haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your vital signs. Please, have a seat on the examination table. Blood pressure is 130/85. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is normal. Heart sounds are within normal limits, though slightly faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your throat and examine your extremities. Open your mouth for me, please. Your throat appears normal, though slightly pale. Now, let me check your hands and feet. Any swelling or unusual discoloration?
