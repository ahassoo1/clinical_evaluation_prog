DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm Dr. Yackey. Let’s try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Concise? Hmph. Well, alright. I suppose. What is it you want to know, young man? I haven’t got all day, you know. Though, honestly, I can't even recall why I'm here. Something about not wanting… something done? My daughter insisted I come. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right. Your daughter brought you in today, you say. And you’re not entirely certain of the reason?
PATIENT: Oh, she fills my head with all sorts of nonsense. Something about my feet… and not letting anyone “poke and prod.” Honestly, doctors these days. Back in my day, a doctor came to your house, and you didn’t need all these… tests and questions. I just want to be left alone, really. Is that so much to ask? My feet feel fine, mostly. A little ache here and there, what do you expect at my age?
DOCTOR: A little ache… and your daughter is concerned about this “ache.” Can you describe the ache for me, Ms. Gunasekara?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… well, it's there. In my feet, naturally. It's not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… dull throb. Like a tired muscle, maybe? I used to dance, you know. Beautiful dances. But that was… a long time ago. It comes and goes, really. Not a constant bother. Honestly, it’s probably just old age creeping in. I don't see what all the fuss is about. Is this going to take long? I had a lovely grapefruit this morning, and I don’t want it to go bad.
DOCTOR: And is this ache worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… now. It's… worse after I've been on my feet for a bit, I suppose. Not that I do much standing these days. A little walk around the house, maybe. But if I’m doing something… well, anything at all, really… it gets a bit more noticeable. But then it goes away when I sit. It’s just… a nuisance, mostly. You’re asking a lot of questions for something that’s not even that bad. Are you sure this is necessary? My daughter, bless her heart, she’s a worrier. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. A long time. Years, I expect. I don’t keep track of these things. It comes and goes, you know? Like the tide. Sometimes it’s barely there, sometimes you notice it a bit more. I really couldn’t say exactly when it started. Before my divorce, probably. Though… that was a long time ago, too. Why is it so important to know exactly when? It's not like I can pinpoint the precise moment my feet started to feel old. Honestly, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, you mean like… serious things? Well, my blood pressure isn’t what it used to be, the doctor told me that. And my knees, they creak a bit. What else…? I forget. I used to have a wonderful memory, but it’s… faded with time. I take a little pill for the blood pressure, that’s about it. Nothing major. I'm not one for complaining. Just… old age, you know? It comes with aches and pains and… forgetting things. It’s a natural process. Is this all going on the record? My daughter will be wanting to hear every detail, I suppose. She treats me like I’m a child sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm. That's a good question. I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine over the years. A little something for a cold now and then, but nothing regularly. Allergies… I don’t think so. I used to get a rash from poison ivy when I was a girl, but that was… ages ago. As far as I know, I’m not allergic to anything. But I can’t be certain. Honestly, it's been so long since anyone’s asked me about allergies. I just take what the doctor gives me, usually. Are you writing all of this down? It's rather exhausting recalling all these details.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to examine your feet now, Ms. Gunasekara. Can you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly. Very well. But don’t expect much. They're just old feet. I’ve walked a lot in my time, you know. A lot of dancing, a lot of… living. They’ve earned a bit of peace and quiet, I think. Be gentle, young man. Be very gentle. I don't want any surprises. My daughter will be wanting a full report, I'm sure. She’s a stickler for details, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. Let’s take a look. I note some mild edema bilaterally. Skin appears intact, although there's some thinning of the epidermis. I'm assessing your range of motion now… slightly limited dorsiflexion in both ankles. Pulses are present, but diminished. There appears to be a mild bony prominence on the medial aspect of both feet. No obvious signs of infection or open wounds. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Edema? Dorsiflexion? What are you talking about, young man? It sounds like you’re speaking another language. No, I don't feel any… tingling. Just the ache, like I said. It's not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… dull throb. Are you sure you’re a real doctor? You seem to be more interested in fancy words than actually listening to me. My daughter insisted I come here, but I’m beginning to think she’s made a mistake. A bony prominence? Well, of course there are bones in my feet! Everyone has bones! Honestly, this is ridiculous. What exactly are you hoping to find?
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I’m simply documenting my findings. The examination is to rule out any serious underlying causes for your discomfort. Given your age and the diminished pulses, it’s prudent to investigate further. I recommend a vascular ultrasound to assess blood flow in your legs and feet. This will help determine if there’s any underlying arterial insufficiency. I also suggest a consultation with a podiatrist to discuss potential footwear modifications and management of any foot deformities. Do you agree to these recommendations?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? A podiatrist? Now you’re really trying to frighten me. I came here because my daughter told me to, and now you want to send me off for all sorts of tests and consultations with people I’ve never even heard of? Honestly, it’s a bit much. No. I do not agree. I just want to be left alone. My feet ache a little, so what? It's old age. It’s not a crisis. I refuse to be poked and prodded and scanned and… whatever else you have planned. Tell my daughter I said so. And frankly, I think I’d like a second opinion. A real doctor, one who actually listens to his patients. I’ve wasted enough time here already. I'm leaving now. And please, don't call me again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. As you wish. This summary outlines my findings and recommendations. Please review it with your daughter. I strongly advise you to reconsider the vascular ultrasound and podiatrist consultation. Ignoring the potential for underlying vascular insufficiency could have serious consequences. However, the final decision is yours. Have a good day.
