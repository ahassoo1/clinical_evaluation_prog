DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my heart, it… sometimes feels like it’s flapping. Not always, but when it happens, it’s… fast, but not strong, you know? Like a little bird inside. It scares my wife. That’s why I come.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your heart sometimes feels like it's fluttering or racing, and it's concerning your wife. That's good you're getting it checked out. When you say it happens, can you describe when it happens most often?
PATIENT: Hmm… not when I’m doing things. Not when I work, not when I walk. It… mostly when I rest. Like, sitting and watching TV, or before I sleep. Sometimes when I wake up too. Not every night, but… often. It don’t last long, maybe a few minutes, then it stops. But it feels… strange.
DOCTOR: So it happens mostly at rest – when you’re relaxing or trying to sleep – and it doesn’t last very long, just a few minutes at a time. Okay. And does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? You mean… something that makes it happen? No, not really. I don’t think so. I drink tea sometimes, but I drink tea every day. I eat the same food… I don’t do anything different when it happens. It just… starts. My wife says maybe it’s stress, but I don’t feel stressed. Work is okay. Life is okay. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No clear triggers that you’ve noticed, and you don’t feel particularly stressed. Okay. Have you ever felt any other symptoms along with this fluttering?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I… sometimes feel a little tired after, but I work long days. Maybe that’s just the work. No… no chest pain. No… dizziness. I don’t think so. Sometimes a little… short of breath, but just for a few seconds when it’s happening. That’s all. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, you know? Just… feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No chest pain or dizziness, just occasional shortness of breath and fatigue afterward. And you're right, it sounds like it doesn't cause pain, just an unsettling feeling. Now, I’d like to ask a little more about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve never been to the doctor before this. My wife, she’s the one who always goes. She says I'm too stubborn. I eat good food, I work hard… I thought I was healthy. No high blood pressure, no sugar problems. Never any heart problems. I… I don't even know what those things are, really. Just this… flapping. My father, he was okay. My mother, she… she died old. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no known medical conditions and a family history that seems relatively unremarkable. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, sometimes medications can cause these types of sensations. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pills. No vitamins. Nothing. I don't like to take pills. My wife, she takes some for her head, but not me. I drink tea, that’s all. Just regular tea. Black tea. Sometimes with a little sugar. But that’s it. I don't believe in taking a lot of medicine if you don't need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. No medications at all. Let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don’t like smoking. Smells bad. Makes you cough. My wife, she doesn’t like it either. It’s bad for you, everyone knows that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I drink a little coffee sometimes, but not a lot. Just one cup in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, just a single cup of coffee in the morning. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't drink alcohol. Not ever. My family, we don't drink. Not good for you. Makes you… silly. And my wife, she doesn’t like it. So, no alcohol. Never. Just tea. And sometimes coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. So, no tobacco, limited coffee, and no alcohol. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My wife, she said you were a good doctor. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? I don’t like being poked. But I trust you. Do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, everything sounds reasonably normal, although I did hear a slight murmur with your heart. I also noticed your blood pressure is a little high. A murmur isn't always a cause for concern, but we should investigate further. I think it’s a good idea to get an EKG, which is a simple test that records your heart’s electrical activity. It will give us a better understanding of what might be causing these palpitations. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: EKG? What’s that? Is it… painful? And a murmur? That sounds bad. What does it mean? My wife, she will worry. Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to know if it’s something bad. I don't want to worry her. If it’s just a little thing, I don’t want to bother with tests. But if it’s something bad… then I guess I need to do it. Tell me. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a deep breath. An EKG – electrocardiogram – is a very simple, painless test. We just put some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart's electrical activity. It doesn't involve any needles or discomfort. As for the murmur… a murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. Many murmurs are harmless – they’re called “innocent murmurs.” But sometimes, they can indicate a problem with your heart valves. That’s why we want to investigate further with the EKG. It will help us determine if this murmur is innocent or if it needs further attention. Right now, I’m not saying there’s anything seriously wrong. I just want to be thorough and rule out any potential problems. Getting an EKG is the best way to do that. It’s a quick and easy test, and it will give us peace of mind, either way. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles. That’s good. And you said… not serious right now? Just… to be safe? My wife, she’ll be relieved to hear that. If it’s just to be safe… then yes. Yes, I will do the test. Just… how long does it take? And will it show if something is really wrong? If it shows something bad… what happens then? My wife… she worries a lot. I don’t want to scare her. But I want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad you’re willing to do the test. It takes just a few minutes – maybe five to ten minutes at most. We’ll do it right here in the office. And you’re right to ask about what happens if it shows something wrong. If the EKG shows any abnormalities, it doesn’t necessarily mean there's a serious problem. It just means we need to investigate further. That might involve a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – who can do more advanced testing, like an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart. I want to assure you that we’re taking this step to be proactive and get a clear picture of your heart health. I’ll explain everything to you and your wife every step of the way. We will address any concerns and answer all your questions. Right now, we're just gathering information. We'll know more once we have the EKG results. Would you like me to call your wife and let her know what we're doing and reassure her?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. She worries a lot. Tell her it doesn't hurt, and it's just to be safe. And… tell her you said it doesn't mean anything is wrong right now. She always listens to you. Her number is… 555-123-4567. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I… I get nervous at doctors. I don’t come here very often. But you make it… easier. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. That’s what I’m here for. I will call your wife now and explain everything. I'll let her know it's a painless test and that we're just being thorough. “Hello, is this Mrs. Puder?
