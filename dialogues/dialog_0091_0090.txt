DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, um... yes. I’m here for… a clearance. For surgery. Cosmetic surgery, that is. My… my husband and I were planning it, but… well. He passed away a few months ago. It’s… it’s still difficult. And now I’m trying to… move forward with it, if that makes sense. It's just a formality, I believe, to ensure I'm healthy enough.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Brightful. My condolences for your loss. It takes courage to move forward, and I’m happy to help in any way I can with this pre-operative evaluation. It's good you are thinking about all aspects of your health before proceeding. To begin, could you tell me what type of cosmetic surgery you are planning?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you to say. Um… it’s a… a tummy tuck, and… and a little bit of lifting, on my… chest. Not a lot, just… to restore things, you know? It’s not… essential, of course. I just… I’d like to feel a bit more like myself again. Honestly, I can’t recall all the specifics – my husband handled most of the arrangements with the surgeon. It was his idea, really. I just… agreed.
DOCTOR: I see. A tummy tuck and breast lift. That’s helpful to know. And it’s perfectly understandable that your husband took the lead with the arrangements. To help me get a complete picture of your overall health, could you please tell me about any significant medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a bit difficult to recall, to be perfectly honest. I try not to dwell on things. Let me think… I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And… I broke my arm once, when I was very young. Beyond that… I don't really have any… major illnesses. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have… a touch of anxiety, I suppose, especially since… well, since everything happened. But I’m not on any medication for it. I try to manage it with… walks, and… being outdoors.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And managing anxiety with walks and outdoor activity is excellent. We can certainly discuss that further if needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than a broken arm?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I recall. The broken arm was when I was maybe… eight years old? It was a silly thing, climbing a tree. My mother was quite upset. Aside from that… no surgeries, no hospital stays. Nothing like that. I’ve been very fortunate, truly. I sometimes wish I was more… interesting medically speaking, but… I suppose it’s better this way, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is generally better to have a straightforward medical history, Ms. Brightful. Less is often more. Now, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take a multivitamin, just a basic one, every morning with breakfast. And… occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that's… very infrequent. Really, that’s it. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I prefer to… avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if it can. I do sometimes drink chamomile tea, if I'm feeling anxious, but I wouldn't call that a medication, exactly.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. And chamomile tea is a perfectly reasonable way to manage mild anxiety. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any serious reactions to anything, that I’m aware of. I sometimes get a little itchy when I’m around cats, but I don't think that’s a true allergy, just… a sensitivity. My husband used to say I was allergic to dust, because I always sneezed when cleaning, but… I think it was just the dust! No, I don’t believe I have any significant allergies, Doctor. None that require any medication, at least.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies. That simplifies things considerably. Now, could you briefly tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… another difficult one. My family… they weren't much for talking about illnesses. My mother always said it brought bad luck to dwell on such things. I know my grandmother on my mother’s side… she had high blood pressure, I think. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he had something with his heart, but I don’t recall the specifics. He passed away quite young, unfortunately. Beyond that… I honestly don’t know a great deal about my family’s medical history. We weren’t very close, and… well, it wasn’t something we discussed openly. I apologize for not being more helpful. It's a bit of a blank, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Brightful. It's quite common for family medical history to be incomplete. Don’t apologize. We will proceed with what you do know. Now, may I ask a few questions about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Ask away. I’ll do my best to answer. I find it… quite refreshing to talk about these things, actually. It's nice to feel like someone is… taking care of me, in a way. Especially now.
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that, Ms. Brightful. That is my intention. First, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always found the idea… rather unpleasant, to be honest. And my husband… he disliked it intensely. We both believed in keeping our bodies healthy, as much as possible. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I do sometimes… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s it. Very occasionally.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol would you say you consume on a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not very much, Doctor. Perhaps… two or three glasses of wine a week? Occasionally a small sherry with my husband, but that was… before. Now, I rarely drink alone. I find it… doesn’t feel quite right. It's just… a little something with dinner, on a Friday or Saturday, perhaps. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I'm not a heavy drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Finally, may I ask about your activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I try to stay active, Doctor. I do a fair bit of gardening, which I find… very therapeutic. And I enjoy long walks in the park, whenever the weather allows. I used to go hiking with my husband, but… well, that’s on hold for now. I suppose you could say I’m moderately active. I don’t go to the gym, or anything like that, but I’m certainly not sedentary. I like being outdoors, moving around. It helps me… clear my head. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That answers it perfectly, Ms. Brightful. That's very helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, may I confirm your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I believe I'm around… 1 meter 55 centimeters. And… oh dear, I haven't weighed myself in a while. Perhaps… 93 kilograms? It fluctuates a little, depending on what I’ve been eating. But that’s a fairly accurate estimate, I believe. I'm… not particularly tall, and I’ve always been… a bit on the fuller side. It’s nothing to worry about, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Brightful. That’s helpful. Now, would you be comfortable if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Please do. I understand it’s necessary. Just… try not to startle me, if you would be so kind. I’m… a bit jumpy these days. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle and thorough as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. I’m listening to your heart now. Your rhythm is regular. I don't hear any murmurs or extra sounds. Breathing sounds are clear in all fields, but slightly diminished in the bases. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, with no significant tenderness to palpation, but there is some fullness. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Neurological function appears intact. Reflexes are normal. Alright, Ms. Brightful. The physical examination was within normal limits, with a slight decrease in breath sounds and some fullness to the abdomen. Given your planned procedure and your medical history, I'd like to order some basic bloodwork to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Bloodwork is fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to be absolutely sure everything is… in order, before proceeding. I trust your judgment completely. And thank you for being so… thorough, and so kind. It’s… a relief to feel like someone is taking care of me. So yes, please go ahead with the bloodwork. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I can provide some reassurance. The bloodwork will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. It will give us a good overview of your kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and overall health. I’ll give you a lab requisition form to take to the lab down the hall. They'll need a sample of blood, and it’s best to be fasting for eight hours beforehand, so no food or drinks other than water. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. No questions at the moment. Just… thank you again. It’s… it’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that everything is being taken care of. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness, more than words can say. I'll go and get the bloodwork done now, and I’ll be sure to fast beforehand. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. That’s my pleasure. No, there's nothing else at the moment. Just take it easy and prioritize getting a good night's rest. Once the results are back – typically within a few business days – my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have any new concerns before then. Have a good day, Ms. Brightful, and please take care of yourself.
