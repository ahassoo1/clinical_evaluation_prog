DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's about some paperwork I need to get sorted. A friend of mine… a very good friend… is looking at coming to the States, and I believe there are some shots needed for the visa process. I want to make sure everything is proper, you see. I’m helping him with all of this.
DOCTOR: Paperwork… right. And you’d like me to… facilitate this paperwork?
PATIENT: Not exactly, Doctor. I need to know what paperwork. What vaccinations are required for someone coming here, and if I need to get a record of any I may have had in the past. Or, if I need to get some now. I’m a little lost on where to start, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I needed anything like this.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Skarbek, I’m an Internal Medicine physician. I treat patients. I don’t typically handle visa requirements. That falls more under… public health, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, dear. I see. I apologize, Doctor. I didn’t realize… I just thought, being a doctor, you’d know what was needed for someone coming into the country. I'm not very good with these things, and I'm afraid I didn't think it through properly. Could you perhaps point me in the right direction? A number to call, maybe?
DOCTOR: Honestly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor? I understand if you haven’t the time, of course. I just… I want to help my friend, and I’m trying to do everything correctly. He's coming from a difficult situation, and I don't want any delays because of something I’ve overlooked.
DOCTOR: Fine. Look on the CDC website. Center for Disease Control. They have… information. Regarding immigration requirements. Vaccination schedules. That’s the best I can do for you, Mr. Skarbek. I really must get to my other patients. Do you have any actual medical concerns today?
PATIENT: The CDC website… yes, I think I've heard of that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you telling me. No, I don’t have any… problems with my health, per se. Just trying to assist my friend. I won’t take up any more of your time. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Then I believe we’re finished here. Have a… pleasant day, Mr. Skarbek. And please, consult the CDC website. It will save us both time in the future. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
