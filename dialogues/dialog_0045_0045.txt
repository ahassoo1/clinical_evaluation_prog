DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor Billman. It is… flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes, not all the time. It’s… embarrassing, you know? Happens when I get… warm, maybe? Or excited? I don’t know exactly.
DOCTOR: Right. Flushing. Happens when you get warm or excited… Okay. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… a few months, maybe? Six months, perhaps? It started… after my wife, she… passed away. But I don't know if it is that. It could just be the weather, you know? Gets hot very easily now. Everything feels hot.
DOCTOR: Six months… and you feel it’s possibly related to the change in weather, or… other things?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe. It is hard to say. After my wife… everything is different. I get… feelings. Sadness, mostly. Sometimes a little… jumpy? I don’t sleep as well either. But the flushing… it just feels like being hot. Not a fever, though. Never a fever. Just… red face. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Well, “normal” is a relative term. Changes can happen after a significant loss, Mr. Withycombe. Both physically and emotionally. Let's try to narrow things down. Aside from the sadness and trouble sleeping, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes my heart… beats faster. Not always, but when the flushing happens, yes. And… I sweat more. Even when I am not doing much. Little things. Not big, but… there. Do you… need a list? I can try to make a list if it helps. I used to be very good at lists, my wife always said.
DOCTOR: No, no list needed just yet. Faster heartbeat and increased sweating… alright. And has anything specific triggered these episodes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. Last week, my neighbor, Mr. Henderson, he asked me about… my wife. Just a polite question, you know? “How are you holding up, Enrique?” And then… my face. Very red. And I felt… shaky. A little bit. Also… the grocery store. Crowded, lots of people. That makes it worse, I think. But maybe it’s just… being around people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so social situations seem to be a trigger. And a polite inquiry about your wife. Has the flushing been accompanied by any dizziness, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath when it happens?
PATIENT: No, not dizziness. Not lightheaded. I can still think, still walk. Shortness of breath… no. Just… hot and red. And a little bit embarrassed, mostly. I try to hide it, you know? Wave a hand, say I am warm. But it's not always working, I think. People look at me funny.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it could be a number of things, Mr. Withycombe. Given your history and the triggers you’ve described, it sounds like we should rule out a few possibilities. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then we can talk about some potential causes, and maybe some tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam is good. I haven't had one in… a long time. I suppose it is best to check everything, yes? And… what kind of tests? I hope they are not… painful. I am not very good with… needles.
DOCTOR: We'll start with the basics: blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll take a look at your thyroid as well. As for tests, we might do a blood test – just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And possibly an EKG, to check your heart rhythm. The blood test is a standard prick of the finger or arm – nothing too bad. And the EKG involves some stickers on your chest. Hardly noticeable. We’ll see what the exam shows first. If you could just hop up on the table for me, Mr. Withycombe. Let’s start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Blood pressure first, yes? I always get nervous at the doctor. Makes it go up, I think. My blood pressure, that is. Is that bad? Will I have to take… pills? My neighbor, Mr. Henderson, he takes a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: It’s quite common to feel anxious at the doctor’s office, Mr. Withycombe. That can elevate your blood pressure a bit, yes. We'll take it again in a few minutes after you’ve settled down. Heart sounds… a little fast, but regular. No murmurs that I detect. Lungs are clear. Good. Thyroid feels normal. Not enlarged. Alright, everything seems physically normal, but your heart rate is elevated. Given your history and symptoms, it’s likely stress and anxiety related to your loss. However, we still need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Stress and anxiety… yes, that sounds… possible. My wife… I miss her very much. It’s hard. But… is there anything else it could be? You said you still need to rule things out. What things? And… will these tests be expensive? I don't have… insurance. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: Well, we need to rule out things like hyperthyroidism – an overactive thyroid gland – even though your exam was normal. Also, a pheochromocytoma, which is a rare tumor that can cause these symptoms. It's unlikely, but we need to be thorough. And, less likely, certain heart conditions. As for the cost… the blood work will be around $150, and the EKG about $80. I understand you don't have insurance. We can discuss a payment plan, but you may want to look into community health services; they sometimes offer reduced rates. I'll give you a list of local resources. Frankly, it sounds like this is largely a psychological issue, and perhaps some counseling would be more beneficial than extensive testing at this point.
PATIENT: $150 and $80… That is… a lot of money. I only get a small check each month. I suppose… the tests are necessary, if you say so. I’ll try to find the money. Counseling… I don’t know. Talking about my wife… it’s hard. I miss her too much. But… if you think it would help… maybe. I suppose I can try. Do you… know any good counselors? Someone… gentle? And not too expensive? I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: There's a community mental health center on Elm Street that offers sliding scale fees. I can print you their contact information. As for "gentle," it's subjective, but they have a few counselors specializing in grief and loss. It may take a few sessions to find someone you connect with. Alright. I'm going to order the blood work and EKG. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood and put on the EKG stickers. I'll review the results when they come back, and we'll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to manage your stress. Deep breathing exercises, maybe some light walking. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Thank you for… trying to help. I just hope… everything is alright. .
