DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, is it? That’s a pretty name. Well, it’s… it’s my stomach, mostly. Been feeling awful queasy lately, and I just… I don’t seem to be able to eat much at all before I get full. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it's getting worse, I think. I'm afraid it might be connected to… well, you know… the cancer.
DOCTOR: Yes, Beinborn. And thank you. It's good to meet you too, Raymonde. I see here you've had some previous cancer treatment. It's certainly possible that this could be related, or it could be something else entirely. We’ll figure it out. To start, could you tell me a bit more about this queasiness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, the treatment… that was a while back now. It’s hard to remember exactly when it was, but it was… several years ago. As for the queasiness… it’s not exactly like being sick to my stomach, you know? It’s more of a… unsettled feeling. And it happens pretty quick. I might just take a couple of bites of something, and then… suddenly I just don’t want any more. Even things I used to really enjoy. And it's not just after I eat, sometimes it feels that way before I even start.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's an unsettled feeling, happening both before and after eating, and it doesn’t always involve nausea. And it’s affecting your appetite even for foods you usually enjoy. That’s helpful to know. When did you first notice this starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… that's the hardest part. Let me think… It started… maybe a couple of months ago? Or was it three? It's all blurring together, I'm afraid. It wasn't terrible at first, just a little off. But like I said, it's been getting worse steadily. I thought maybe it was just a little something I ate, but it hasn't gone away. I wish I could be more precise for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. It’s very common to have trouble remembering exact dates. A couple of months is a good starting point. We can work with that. Now, besides this feeling of being unsettled and the decreased appetite, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Other symptoms… Well, I've been feeling a little tired lately, but I always chalked that up to getting older. And… oh, my stomach does make some funny noises sometimes. Not painful, just… gurgling and rumbling. I don’t know if that's important. And I guess… I haven’t been as regular as I used to be, if you know what I mean. Everything seems to be a bit… slower, shall we say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, stomach noises – gurgling and rumbling – and some changes in your bowel habits. Changes in bowel habits are definitely good to note. Has there been any blood in your stool, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Blood… no, not that I've noticed. I always check, you know, just to be sure. And weight loss… well, my clothes might be a little looser, but I haven't actually weighed myself in… oh, goodness, probably months. I try not to dwell on that sort of thing. It's just… I don't have much of an appetite these days, so I suppose it wouldn't be surprising if I've lost a bit. I mostly just eat enough to keep my strength up.
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood in the stool, possible unintentional weight loss, but you haven't weighed yourself recently. And decreased appetite. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Besides the cancer treatment you’ve already mentioned, do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… High blood pressure, yes. I’ve been on medication for that for years now. And… I had a little bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but the doctor said it was just a flutter, nothing serious. They gave me some pills for that too, but I don’t take them anymore. Everything else… I don't think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. My grandmother lived to be ninety-five, you know. Cherokee blood, strong people. Though this queasiness is making me feel anything but strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, currently medicated, and a history of a heart flutter. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I've taken all sorts of pills over the years, and never had a problem. I used to get stung by bees all the time when I was a little girl, playing out in the woods, but I never had a bad reaction to that either. Just a little swelling, that's all. I think I'm pretty lucky, all things considered. Though this feeling… it’s something new.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you’re currently taking medication for your high blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Lisinopril, I think it is. A little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Though I haven't been eating much breakfast lately… everything just feels so… off. But I still try to take my pills, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. And you said you've been taking it regularly even with the decreased appetite, that’s good. Now, just to complete the picture, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils taken out. And… oh, and when I broke my wrist when I was younger, I had to have surgery to set it. Other than that… not that I can remember. Nothing major, anyway. Just the usual bumps and bruises, I suppose. I don't think so. Nothing that I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and surgery to repair a broken wrist. And finally, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… My mother… she had some trouble with her heart when she was older. And my uncle… he had cancer, lung cancer, I think it was. But other than that… not really. My grandmother lived to be ninety-five, like I said. Very strong woman. A lot of good genes on that side of the family, I think. Though it doesn’t seem to be helping me much right now. This queasiness is just… wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your mother and lung cancer in your uncle. Alright, Raymonde, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Just a routine check.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It's just… I'm a little worried about what you might find, I suppose. But I know you're doing your best to help me. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not excessively so. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Not sharp pain, but some discomfort when I press. No masses or guarding that I can detect. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Bowel sounds are present, but a little sluggish. Alright. Everything seems within normal limits, but the tenderness in your upper right quadrant and the sluggish bowel sounds are something we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? The tenderness… I suppose I have been feeling a little bit of discomfort there lately, but I just thought it was indigestion. And my stomach has been a little slow. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it serious? Is it… the cancer again?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’ve noticed the tenderness and sluggishness. It’s certainly possible it's related to your previous cancer treatment, and that’s something we need to consider. However, there are several other possibilities that could be causing these symptoms. Indigestion can definitely cause abdominal tenderness, but given your history, we need to rule out other causes. The sluggish bowel sounds could be due to decreased appetite or medication side effects, but we should also look into it further. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your liver function, your pancreatic enzymes, and a complete blood count. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen would be a good idea to get a better look at your organs and rule out any blockages or masses. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. It's important to remember that we haven't reached a diagnosis yet, and these tests are simply to gather more information. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… more tests. I suppose that's just what has to be done. Liver function… pancreatic enzymes… a CT scan… It all sounds a little frightening, to be honest. If you wouldn’t mind explaining a little bit, Doctor. Just so I know what to expect. What are you looking for, exactly? And what will the CT scan feel like? I’ve never had one before. It's just… I get a little nervous with all these medical things, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. Let me explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood tests will give us a snapshot of how your liver and pancreas are functioning. Your liver helps digest food and remove toxins from your body, and your pancreas produces enzymes that help break down food. Abnormal levels in these tests could indicate inflammation, infection, or other problems. The CT scan is a type of X-ray that creates detailed images of your organs. It’s a non-invasive procedure, and you’ll be lying on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye to help improve the images. You won’t feel anything during the scan itself, but you might feel a little warm sensation from the dye. It usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour. We’re looking for any signs of blockages, inflammation, or masses in your organs. It’s important to rule out any serious causes of your symptoms, and the CT scan will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with anything like that before. I used to get those X-rays when I broke my wrist, and I didn’t have any problems then. But it was a long time ago… I can’t really remember the details. It’s just… I’m worried it might be the cancer spreading. Is that a possibility? I know you said you don’t know yet, but… it's just in the back of my mind. It's hard not to think about it, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried about that, Raymonde. Given your history, it’s a valid concern. And it's good that you're voicing your anxieties. We will take that into consideration as we proceed with the tests. The CT scan will help us determine if there's any evidence of spread. The tests will help us rule things out, as well as identify the problem. Right now, we don't have enough information to say definitively whether it's related to the cancer or something else. But we are going to investigate thoroughly. In the meantime, I’m going to order these tests, and I’ll give you a referral to get them done as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. I'll also give you something for the nausea to help keep you comfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Anything to make me feel a little better. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly, and for being so patient with me. I know I’m probably not the easiest patient. Something for the nausea would be wonderful. It’s just… draining, you know? I can't seem to do anything when I feel queasy all the time. Okay. Let's get these tests done. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re not difficult at all, Raymonde. It’s my job to explain things and make you feel comfortable. And it’s perfectly okay to be anxious. We'll get through this together. Here’s the prescription for promethazine. It will help with the nausea. Take it as directed, and let me know if it’s not effective. I’m also giving you a referral to the radiology center for the CT scan and a lab order for the blood work. They’ll schedule the CT scan at your convenience. Once you have the results, they’ll send them to me, and I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… clear enough. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I suppose… just try to stay positive, right? And get these tests done as soon as possible. Okay. I think that’s all. I’ll see you when you have the results. And thank you again for the medication. I’m already feeling a little better just knowing I have something for the nausea. .
DOCTOR: Exactly, Raymonde. Try to stay positive, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be here to help in any way I can. It was nice meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day. .
