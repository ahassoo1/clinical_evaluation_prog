DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know, medical stuff for the insurance. Want to get it over with quick if we can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I understand. We’ll do our best to be efficient. To start, this “medical stuff” – is there anything specific the insurance company requested, or are we doing a general health assessment?
PATIENT: Um… I think it was just a general thing. Blood pressure, maybe some blood work. Honestly, they sent a whole packet and my daughter filled most of it out. I just showed up with the forms. I don't really remember what it all said. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Putney. Insurance paperwork can be quite overwhelming. Let me pull up the form your daughter completed. Ah, yes. It looks like they requested a complete physical exam, including vital signs, blood work – a lipid panel and a complete blood count – and an EKG. Is that accurate, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: EKG? Uh… sounds right. If it's on the paper, I guess. I really didn't pay much attention to the details. Look, I'm just trying to get this insurance sorted out. It's for my daughter, mostly. So, whatever needs to be done, let's just get it done. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Putney. We’ll get everything taken care of. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then we'll move on to a physical exam, and finally, the blood work and EKG. Before we begin, do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had any problems with anything like that. I've had a few shots over the years, tetanus and stuff, but never reacted to them. Just… no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. They bother me sometimes. It's… uh… glucosamine, I think. And chondroitin. Something like that. My daughter gets it for me at the store. I take it every other day or so. It helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine and chondroitin. Thank you for letting me know. Now, let’s move on to a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe. The doctor mentioned it a few times over the years, told me to watch my salt. I don't really follow the diet, though. Everything tastes better with salt, you know? Nothing else, though. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no cancer. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Putney. It’s always positive when things are stable. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Years ago, when I was a kid, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Had a cast on for a few weeks. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Never been seriously sick enough to be in the hospital. Just the broken arm. That was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had something with her heart, I think. She was sick for a long time before she passed. My dad… he just… got old, I guess. Nothing specific. Lots of us just get tired easier as we get older, you know? Lots of aches and pains. That’s about it, really. Nothing real serious that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart issues in your mother and general age-related health concerns in the family. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife did, but I always told her to do it outside. It smelled bad. And I didn't want anything to do with it. Always thought it was a silly habit.
DOCTOR: Good. And how often do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a beer sometimes, with dinner. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing crazy. I don't really like getting drunk, to be honest. Makes me feel sick. Just a little something to relax. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers a week. Alright, Mr. Putney. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, let's proceed with the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, and briefly examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, whatever you need to do. Just want to get this over with, Doc. Hurry up would be good.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142/88. Slightly elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears. External canals clear. Tympanic membranes are normal in appearance. Finally, I'll briefly examine your abdomen. Please lie back for me. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses appreciated. Everything appears within normal limits at this point, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should address. Now, let's get that blood work done. It’s just a routine test to check your cholesterol and overall health. And we’ll also do the EKG, which is a quick, painless test to check your heart’s electrical activity.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Let's just get it over with. Where do I go for the blood work and the… ECG thing? The sooner I'm done, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the right. The technician, Maria, is expecting you. She'll draw the blood samples. After the blood work, you’ll go to room 3 for the EKG. The technician, David, will explain the procedure. It involves placing some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs. It takes about five minutes. I’ll be reviewing the results as soon as they come in. Once I have everything, we can discuss the findings and a plan for your health. Do you have any questions before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just tell them to hurry. Second door on the right, you said? Alright. Let's go.
