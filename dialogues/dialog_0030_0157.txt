DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I’m a Family Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get this over with. My blood pressure’s been high, that’s why I’m here. My husband made me come.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll do our best to be efficient. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it was high?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really notice things like that. My husband checks it sometimes with that machine he got. He just said it was too high a couple of weeks ago and kept bothering me about it until I agreed to come. I don't pay attention to numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your husband has been monitoring your blood pressure at home and noted elevated readings over the past couple of weeks. Do you know what those readings were, approximately?
PATIENT: No. He just said "high." Like, above whatever normal is. I don’t ask for specifics. He gets… detailed. And I really don’t need a lecture right now. Is that all you need to know from him?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We can certainly focus on what you are experiencing. Let's put your husband's readings aside for a moment. Have you been experiencing any symptoms that might be related to high blood pressure, such as headaches, vision changes, dizziness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Headaches sometimes. But I get those a lot. Stress, probably. And… honestly, everything gives me a headache. I work outside, it’s hot, I deal with a lot of… people. No dizziness or anything like that. Just tired. Really tired. Is that it? Can we just get a prescription or whatever and be done?
DOCTOR: Okay, so headaches are your primary symptom, and you're feeling fatigued. We’ll definitely look into both of those. Before we consider a prescription, it’s important to get a good baseline understanding of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I’m… mostly healthy. I eat okay, I guess. I mean, I try to. Working on a construction site doesn't leave a lot of room for fancy meals. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No, we’re making good progress. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that's it. Just a cast. And a lot of complaining. Look, I really don't remember details from when I was little. Is that okay? I just don't have a good memory for things like that. Can we just check my blood pressure again now?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can definitely re-check your blood pressure. But it’s also helpful to know about your family’s medical history, if you’re comfortable sharing that. Are there any health conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Okay, look. My grandma on my mom's side had… something with her heart. She was really old when she died, so it wasn’t a big surprise. And my uncle, I think, had diabetes. But honestly, nobody really talks about health stuff. It’s just… not done. I don’t know anything specific. Can we please just skip this part? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can certainly proceed without detailed family history. Let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I need all my wits about me for my job, thank you very much. And my husband doesn’t approve. He’s… very particular about things like that. What else? Seriously, how much longer is this going to take? I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: Just a few more quick questions, and then we'll do a physical exam and check your blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. When I remember. And ibuprofen when my head really hurts. That’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid taking anything if I can. Seems like everything has a million side effects. Can we please just get to the blood pressure part now? I'm really not feeling well.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's move on to the physical exam and check your blood pressure. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take your blood pressure. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I do a physical job all day, I'm probably fine. My husband just worries too much. hurriedly extends her arm
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is elevated. It's currently 162 over 98. This is higher than we'd like to see. While it's not surprising given your husband's concerns, it’s important to investigate this further. Do you feel any discomfort right now?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No. Just… annoyed. Is that all? Look, is this something I need medication for? Because I really don't want to take a bunch of pills. My job is physical, I don't want to be tired all the time. And I have a deadline, remember? Can we just get a quick fix?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about medication, and we'll certainly explore all options before making any decisions. However, a blood pressure reading of 162/98 is significantly elevated and requires attention. Ignoring it could lead to more serious health problems down the line. Before we discuss medication, I’d like to order some blood work and a urine test to rule out any underlying causes for your high blood pressure. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Seriously? Can't you just give me something for it now? I don't have time for a whole investigation. Look, my husband can drive me to the lab, I guess. But I really need to get back to work. Is there anything, anything I can do in the meantime? Some tea? A special exercise? I read somewhere about… something with garlic? Just something besides more tests and waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I wish I could offer a quick fix. Unfortunately, high blood pressure isn’t something we can address with a simple solution. While things like garlic can have a small effect, they aren’t enough to manage significantly elevated blood pressure. In the meantime, to help lower your blood pressure slightly, I recommend reducing your salt intake, staying hydrated, and practicing deep breathing exercises. But these are just temporary measures. Given your blood pressure reading and your concerns, I also recommend that you avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results of your tests. I'm concerned about the possibility of a hypertensive crisis. Would you be willing to consider a low dose of medication while we wait for the test results to ensure your blood pressure is under control?
PATIENT: A hypertensive… what? Look, I'm a construction worker. I need to do strenuous activity. That's my job. And I really don't want to take any pills, thank you very much. My husband will be furious if I start taking medication. He thinks I'm perfectly healthy. Can we just skip the tests and try the garlic thing? Or the deep breathing? I'm serious. I don’t want any medication. And I need to get back to work. Now. Is that possible? Or do I have to go to the hospital? Because I really don’t have time for that.
DOCTOR: A hypertensive crisis is a severe increase in blood pressure that can cause organ damage. Avoiding strenuous activity isn't ideal, but it’s a precaution we need to take until we understand what’s causing your high blood pressure. While I respect your wishes, refusing testing and medication at this point could be risky. However, I understand your hesitation. Let's compromise. We'll order the blood work and urine test, and you can try the garlic and deep breathing exercises. But I strongly recommend that you avoid any strenuous activity for the next 24 hours and monitor your blood pressure at home. If your blood pressure remains above 140/90, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Fine. 24 hours. And I'm telling you, it's probably just stress. This job is… demanding. But I'm not taking any pills until I get the test results. And my husband is driving me to the lab right now. Can we just get the paperwork? I have a deadline. And I really, really need to get back to work. She taps her foot impatiently.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab paperwork ready for you. The nurse will also give you instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure at home. Here's the paperwork, and the nurse will be right with you to discuss the home monitoring process. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any symptoms like severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes. I hope you feel better soon, Ms. Dudney. And please, take care of yourself. .
