DOCTOR: Right. Nixon Kreckel, 18 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, actually. It’s been getting bigger for a few days now, and it’s a bit uncomfortable. I also… I have a heart thing, the doctors told me. Something about it not beating right. Atrial… something? I forget the full name, but they said it might have something to do with my leg.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, likely. A common arrhythmia. And the leg swelling… alright. So, it's just the left leg?
PATIENT: Yes, just the left one. It’s not… painful exactly, more like heavy and achy. And a bit warm, if that makes sense. I haven’t bumped it or anything, it just… started. Is that bad? I’m a bit worried.
DOCTOR: "A bit worried" is understandable. Warmth and swelling… We need to rule out a few things. Have you noticed any redness, or changes in the skin texture?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t really looked closely. It doesn’t look very red, maybe a little bit darker than usual, but I’m not sure. The skin… feels normal, I think. Not bumpy or anything. Is it bad if I don't know? I'm not very good at noticing things like that.
DOCTOR: It's alright, you shouldn’t feel bad about not being a medical expert. We're here to figure things out. Okay, let's start with your history. You mentioned a heart condition, atrial fibrillation. Do you know when you were diagnosed, and are you currently taking any medication for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It was… about a year ago, I think? Maybe a bit more. The doctor at the hospital told me. And no, I’m not taking anything for it. They said… they said I didn’t need anything right now. Just to keep an eye on it. That's what they said, anyway. I sometimes feel a bit… fluttery, in my chest. But it goes away.
DOCTOR: “Not currently medicated.” Alright. And you said the fluttery feeling comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. It's not all the time. More when I’m… stressed, maybe? Or if I’ve had too much coffee. It doesn't last long, usually just a few minutes. It's a bit scary, but the doctor said it was okay. I just… I worry about the leg. Is it connected to the heart thing?
DOCTOR: It could be connected. Atrial fibrillation can sometimes lead to blood clots, and those clots can travel to the leg, causing swelling and discomfort. We need to investigate that possibility. Now, tell me about your activity level. Do you sit for long periods, or are you on your feet a lot?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… bad. I sit a lot, actually. I’m studying to be a computer teacher, so I’m usually at my desk. Not much exercise, I’m afraid. I walk to and from the shops sometimes, but that’s about it. I don't really have time for much else, to be honest. Is that bad for my leg? It doesn't feel like I've done anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: Prolonged sitting can contribute to poor circulation, which can worsen swelling. Alright. Let’s do a quick examination of your leg, and then we’ll discuss some further tests. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds good. Is it going to hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles right now, I promise. Just a visual inspection and feeling for any tenderness or warmth. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. We’ll start with your left leg, naturally. Please let me know if anything does cause discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay. Just tell me what you’re doing, if that’s alright? I get a bit anxious when I don't know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m starting by looking at the skin for any discoloration or signs of injury. Then, I'll gently feel for any tenderness along the calf muscle, and check the pulses in your foot. Pulse feels weak. Also weak. Hmm. 38 centimeters. 36 centimeters. I'm noting some swelling and a slight difference in circumference between your legs. Your pulses feel weaker than I'd like on the left side.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad? The weak pulses? What does that mean? Is it something serious? My mum always worries if I go to the doctor, and she'll want to know everything.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, no. Weak pulses can indicate a blockage in the blood flow to your leg, or a problem with the arteries. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and the swelling, it raises concerns about a possible blood clot, as I mentioned. We need to rule that out immediately. I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. It’s a non-invasive test that will show us if there's a clot, and what’s happening with the blood flow. Also, I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test. That can help to detect the presence of blood clots. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… Doppler ultra-sound? And a blood test? I don't like blood tests. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have a lecture on Tuesday, and I really can’t miss it. This is all a bit much, isn’t it? It was just a swollen leg.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I apologize for the added stress. The blood test is a standard procedure; a small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm, and there will be a brief pinch. The ultrasound is completely painless; a technician will simply move a probe over your leg to create an image of the arteries. It shouldn’t take longer than 30 minutes for each test. It is important to rule out a serious condition, and delaying diagnosis could be detrimental. We can get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lecture...we will do our best to minimize disruption, but your health is the priority. I’m going to write you a note for your professor explaining the situation, if that helps. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A note for my professor, that would be good, thank you. No, I don't think so. I’ve never had an allergy. I get hay fever in the summer, but that's all. No medications, either. I don't really take anything. And the contrast dye… what is that? Is that for the ultra-sound? I’m a bit scared now.
DOCTOR: Hay fever is not a contraindication. The contrast dye is sometimes used in ultrasounds to improve the visibility of the blood vessels. However, we'll likely start with a standard ultrasound without contrast. It's often sufficient. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any instances of blood clots, heart disease, or stroke in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, good. No dye, then. Let me think… my grandfather, on my mum’s side, he had a heart attack a few years ago. And my aunt… she had a blood clot in her leg, after she broke it. It was a long time ago, though. Maybe ten years ago? And my dad’s side… not that I know of. They don’t really talk about health things. Is that important? Does that mean I’m more likely to get one? This is all a bit scary, I'm not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: It is relevant. A family history of blood clots and heart disease does increase your risk. However, it doesn't guarantee you'll develop a clot. Given your symptoms, family history, and the atrial fibrillation, it's prudent to be thorough. I'm ordering these tests to get a clear picture of what's going on. Now, are you currently taking any herbal supplements or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just vitamins sometimes, in the winter. But I haven't taken any for months. I don't really believe in them. And no herbal supplements, either. I don't really… do any of that. When will I get the results? And will it hurt if it is a blood clot? I'm really worried now. My mum will be furious if I've been ignoring something serious.
DOCTOR: It's alright to be worried. It's perfectly normal. We'll get to the bottom of this. The results for the D-dimer should be available within a couple of hours, and the ultrasound report typically takes a bit longer – perhaps by the end of the day. If it is a blood clot, treatment is available. The treatment will depend on the size and location of the clot, but it usually involves blood thinners, and sometimes other interventions. We will discuss all of the options with you in detail if a clot is detected. Now, before we proceed, do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you. Well… my chest has been a bit tight sometimes, like a pressure. And I’ve been a bit breathless, especially when I walk up the stairs. But I just thought it was because I’m out of shape. And my left leg feels… warm, all the time. Not hot, just warm. I haven’t told anyone. I didn’t want to bother them. Is that important, too?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Chest tightness and breathlessness, combined with the warmth in your leg, further raise concerns. It's good you’re telling me now. These symptoms could be related to a pulmonary embolism – a blood clot that travels to the lungs. We need to rule that out immediately. I am going to order a CT pulmonary angiogram. It’s a more detailed scan of your lungs and blood vessels. It does involve a small amount of radiation, but given your symptoms, the benefits of a definitive diagnosis outweigh the risks. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan? With radiation? Oh, no. I don’t like radiation. Is it… dangerous? Will it make me sick? I just came in because my leg was swollen! This is all getting very scary. I don't think I can do this. Can't we just… take some pills? Or something? I really don't want a CT scan.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Nixon. It is a lot to take in, and I apologize for the added anxiety. The amount of radiation from a CT scan is relatively low, comparable to the natural background radiation you're exposed to over a few months. It is highly unlikely to cause any long-term harm. However, I also understand your reluctance. Given your concerns, we can consider a V/Q scan instead. It's an alternative imaging test that doesn't involve radiation. It is slightly less accurate than a CT scan, but it may be sufficient in your case. However, if the V/Q scan is inconclusive, we may still need to proceed with the CT scan to get a definitive diagnosis. Before we decide, do you have any allergies to contrast dyes or iodine?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had an allergy. My mum is allergic to shellfish, but I'm not. A V/Q scan… that sounds better. No radiation. Is it… painful? Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I really need to get back to my studies, I have an assignment due on Friday. And… will I be able to go home afterwards? I don't want to stay in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright, a V/Q scan it is. It's a good option, and I'm glad we could find an alternative that you’re more comfortable with. The V/Q scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive tracer into a vein, then taking images of your lungs with a special camera. It shouldn't be painful – you may feel a brief pinch during the injection, similar to a blood test. The scan itself takes about 30-60 minutes. After the scan, you'll need to drink plenty of fluids to help flush out the tracer. You should be able to go home afterwards, assuming there are no complications. We will review the results with you as soon as they're available. Before we proceed, I’m going to write you a referral for the V/Q scan and a note for your professor, explaining your situation. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you. For explaining everything. And for writing the note for my professor. I guess… we can just get it over with, then. When do we do the scan? And where? Is it far from here?
DOCTOR: Alright. The scan is scheduled for this afternoon at City General Hospital, about a 15-minute drive from here. I’m printing the referral and instructions now. The radiology department will contact you when they’re ready to begin the scan. They’ll explain the procedure in more detail. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. I really appreciate your help. I’ll… see you later, then.
