DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's about the… the cancer. It’s been… hard. I don’t really know where to start, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Cancer," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That's what the other doctors told me. I was… my husband, he helped me with a lot of the appointments before… before he passed. And now I'm trying to keep up with everything on my own. It’s… a lot of information. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to ramble.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “cancer” is a rather broad term, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose it is. They said… a tumor, somewhere inside. I think it was in my… my stomach? But I’ve had tests done at so many places, it’s hard to remember exactly what everyone said. Do you… do you have my records from St. Joseph’s? My husband made sure I had everything transferred.
DOCTOR: Let's see…St. Joseph’s… yes, here we are. Ah. Gastric adenocarcinoma, stage II. Noted. And you were referred by Dr. Evans, oncology. It says here you’ve completed four cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy. Is that correct?
PATIENT: FOLFOX… yes, that sounds right. It made me very sick, though. And tired. Everything just… hurt. I stopped it a few weeks ago. Dr. Evans said we should… explore other options. That’s why I’m here, I think? To see what those options are. I'm not sure I understood everything he said about… scans and things.
DOCTOR: Well, stopping chemotherapy is… not ideal. It’s often a necessary evil, you see, to control the disease. These “other options” likely involve further investigation to determine the extent of the cancer’s spread. We’ll need to review the imaging reports from Dr. Evans. Do you happen to have those with you, or were they sent electronically?
PATIENT: I… I think they were sent electronically. My husband handled all of that. I’m not very good with computers, I’m afraid. Would you be able to get them from St. Joseph’s? I just want to know… is it getting worse? Is there anything that can be done to make me… feel better? I’m sorry, I’m probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: "Silly questions?
PATIENT: No, no, not at all. It’s perfectly reasonable to ask questions. It’s my job to answer them. Let me see if I can pull those reports up electronically. What is your date of birth, please? And perhaps your Medicare number, if you have that handy? It will help me access your file.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see…Chellsea Luft, born November 12th, 2004. Medicare number… yes, found it. Okay. Hmm. The most recent CT scan from July 15th… shows some… progression of the primary tumor. There’s also evidence of… regional lymph node involvement. To be frank, it doesn’t look particularly good. Were you experiencing any new symptoms lately?
PATIENT: New symptoms… well, I've been more tired than usual, even for me. And my stomach… it hurts more. It's a dull ache, mostly, but sometimes it gets really sharp. And I haven’t been able to eat much. Everything just… tastes wrong, and I feel full after a few bites. Is that… is that the cancer getting worse? I’m scared, Doctor. I really am.
DOCTOR: Those symptoms are… consistent with disease progression, yes. The loss of appetite, the abdominal pain, the fatigue... all indicators. Now, before we discuss treatment options—and there are options—we need a clearer picture. I’d like to do a physical exam, if you don’t mind. And I think a repeat endoscopy with biopsy would be prudent. It's important to know exactly what we're dealing with before making any decisions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies that I know of. My husband always took care of all of that paperwork too. A physical exam… and the… endoscopy? What does that involve? I… I don't like the sound of that. Is it painful? I'm sorry, I’m asking a lot of questions, aren't I?
DOCTOR: It involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus and stomach to visualize the lining and take a tissue sample. It’s not comfortable, I won’t lie. You'll be given sedation to minimize discomfort. And frankly, it's necessary. We need to see how far this has progressed. Now, let’s start with the exam. Lie back on the table, please. We'll listen to your abdomen, feel for any masses or tenderness. It will be fairly routine.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I'll do it. Just… just tell me what you're doing, please? I get nervous easily. It's just… it's a lot to take in, all at once. My husband… he always explained everything so clearly. I feel very lost without him.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. I'm listening for any unusual sounds, any fluid accumulation. And now, I'm feeling for any tenderness, any masses. I’m noting some… guarding in the epigastric region, which is consistent with inflammation. It is tender to the touch, I must say. Are you experiencing any nausea at the moment?
PATIENT: No, sir, not right now. Just… anxious. And a little scared. It feels… different than it did before. More… hard. Ooh… that’s… that’s uncomfortable. Is that… is that what you expected? I don’t want to be difficult, I just… I don’t like being touched like that, if that makes sense. My husband… he was very gentle.
DOCTOR: Well, it's supposed to be uncomfortable, Ms. Luft. I'm trying to assess the extent of the disease, not provide a spa treatment. But, very well. Let’s stop there for now. We’ve established there is tenderness, and frankly, that’s concerning. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. And, as I mentioned, an endoscopy with biopsy. Do you have any preferences regarding where you'd like the endoscopy to be performed?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't… I don't have any preferences. Anywhere is fine. Just… as soon as possible, please? I just want to know… what's happening. And… what my options are. I'm tired of feeling sick. And scared. Is there… is there anything I can do to help myself, in the meantime? Something to eat, or… or something to take? I just want to feel a little bit better. Even for a little while.
DOCTOR: Well, there’s no magic cure, Ms. Luft. As for diet… try bland foods, small frequent meals. Avoid anything spicy or acidic. As for medication… an antiemetic might help with the nausea, but frankly, it's just masking the symptoms. I’m sending the orders to the lab now. Someone will contact you to schedule the tests. As soon as we have the results, we'll discuss the treatment options. We'll have to consider chemotherapy, potentially radiation, and possibly surgery, depending on the extent of the disease. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s just focus on getting these tests done first. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… trying. I just… I don't know what I'm going to do. I really don't. .
