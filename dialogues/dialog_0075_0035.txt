DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. My name is Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Dr. Panjoj. It's lovely to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, almost a week now. Just won’t stop! It’s getting a bit tiresome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a full week as of yesterday, I believe. Started right after I had a bit of a fright – young Timmy next door let loose a firecracker right under my hibiscus bush! Nearly jumped out of my skin, I did. And then… hiccups.
DOCTOR: A fright can certainly do that. And they’ve been continuous since then, no breaks at all?
PATIENT: Well, not completely continuous, no. There’s been a few little stretches – maybe an hour here or there – where they quiet down. But then they always come back. It’s like they’re just waiting in the wings, you know? It's rather annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoying is a good word for it. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, aside from the initial scare?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been trying to drink water slowly, like they say, but that doesn’t seem to make a difference. Eating doesn't change it, either. I had a lovely plate of kokoda yesterday and still… hic! …there they are!
DOCTOR: Kokoda, wonderful. And no difficulty swallowing or any heartburn with that?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no trouble swallowing at all. Kokoda went down just lovely. And no heartburn, thankfully. I do get a bit of acid reflux sometimes, but it hasn't been bothering me this week. It's just… hic! …these hiccups! They’re a real nuisance, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said no other symptoms at all accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No pain, no dizziness, no… well, no nothing! Just the hiccups. It's just so odd. I've had hiccups before, of course, everyone does. But they usually go away after a few minutes. This is just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Persistent is right. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind, just to make sure we haven't overlooked anything. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago – must be thirty years now. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing too serious, just gets a bit stiff in the mornings. Oh, and I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years back, but it's well-controlled with medication. I take a little pill every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and hypertension. What medication are you taking for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It's… Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril, ten milligrams every morning. I’ve been on it for about five years now, and it seems to be doing the trick. My doctor checks it regularly, and it’s always good.
DOCTOR: Good. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. Not to any medications, food, or anything at all, as far as I know. I've always been quite lucky in that regard. I can enjoy a lovely mango without a worry!
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. The gallbladder was many, many years ago, and I haven’t had any reason to be in the hospital since then, thankfully. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can! I believe a bit of fresh air and sunshine is the best medicine.
DOCTOR: I agree wholeheartedly. Now, before we proceed, do you take any other medications, vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Just a little something. I take a calcium supplement for my bones, because of the arthritis, you see. And… let me think… Oh, and a vitamin D tablet. The doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine last winter, so he suggested that. That's all, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Calcium and Vitamin D. Excellent. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Do any close relatives have a history of heart problems, strokes, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That's a bit of a mixed bag, to be honest. My mother had hypertension, like me, and my father had diabetes. His sister, my Auntie Sisi, had a stroke about ten years ago. And… oh, yes, my brother had some heart trouble, but he’s doing alright now with medication. It runs in the family, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week. Just a small one, for enjoyment. Nothing excessive, I assure you!
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Go right ahead, Dr. Panjoj. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I haven't had a good listen lately, so it's probably a good idea.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur but that is not uncommon at your age. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your throat looks clear as well, no signs of infection or irritation. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Given everything you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it's likely these hiccups are benign, possibly due to the initial fright, but persistent. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies at all?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear about my heart and lungs! I am glad they are clear. And you’re right, that fright was a bit of a shock. As for remedies… well, I tried holding my breath, like everyone says, but that just made me feel a bit dizzy. And I tried drinking water upside down, but that was a bit messy, to be honest. Nothing seems to work! I’ve been trying to stay calm, but it’s hard when you’re constantly hic! … interrupting yourself!
DOCTOR: I understand. Those remedies don't always work, and they can be rather uncomfortable. Since they've been persistent for a week now, and we've ruled out anything immediately concerning, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying medical causes. It's just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, then I’m happy to do it. A chest X-ray and a blood test, you say? Yes, perfectly alright. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and we can schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, if the hiccups become severe or you experience any difficulty breathing, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe a medication called Baclofen, which can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. It's a muscle relaxant. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you respond. Do you have any concerns about taking a new medication?
PATIENT: Oh, Baclofen, you say? A muscle relaxant… Hmm. I haven't taken anything like that before. I’m always a little cautious about new medications, to be honest. What are the possible side effects, Dr. Panjoj? And will it interact with my blood pressure medication?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question. Baclofen can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and sometimes nausea. It's important not to drive or operate heavy machinery while you're taking it. As for interactions with Lisinopril, there's a low risk, but it can potentially lower your blood pressure further. We’ll monitor that closely. I’ll start you on a low dose – 5 milligrams three times a day – and ask you to check your blood pressure at home regularly. If it drops below 120/80, reduce the dose to 2.5 milligrams. Do you feel comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Five milligrams three times a day, and keep an eye on my blood pressure. I do have a blood pressure monitor at home, so I can do that. And if it goes too low, I lower the dose. Yes, I think I can handle that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Panjoj.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’ll also give you a written prescription and a handout with information about Baclofen and potential side effects. We'll review the test results once they're available and adjust the plan if needed. In the meantime, try to stay relaxed, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid anything that might trigger the hiccups. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly, Dr. Panjoj. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. Hopefully, this medication will do the trick! I appreciate your kindness and patience. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I'll see you again once we have the test results. Have a good day, and hopefully, those hiccups will quiet down soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Dr. Panjoj. You too. And yes, I certainly hope so! I'm sure they will now. .
