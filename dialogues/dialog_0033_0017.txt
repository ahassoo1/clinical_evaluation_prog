DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. So, you're here today… why don’t you tell me what brought you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. The… the paper said somethin’ ‘bout a tryout. For… sports. I think. My… ex-wife, she made the appointment. She always liked me stayin’ active. Though, honestly, I don’t recall which sport. It’s been… a while. A long while. Is this for… baseball? I used to play a little. Not much.
DOCTOR: A tryout?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. A tryout. She said… somethin’ about gettin’ me out of the house. And checkin’ if my… parts still work, I guess. For… you know. Runnin’ and… throwin’. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don’t remember signin’ up for nothin’. She handles all that. Or used to. She’s… not around for the details anymore. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to establish why you are seeing me today, Dr. Dechene, Internal Medicine. I have no record of any sports tryout scheduled through this clinic. Perhaps there’s been a misunderstanding. Are you experiencing any specific medical complaints?
PATIENT: Medical… complaints? No, ma’am, nothin’ like that. Just… old. I’m old, that’s what. Fifty-one years. Things creak a little. But I ain’t complainin’. My ex-wife, she always said I was too stubborn to complain. Maybe that’s why she left. But no, I don’t feel sick. Just… tryin’ to figure out why I’m here spendin’ my afternoon. Is this a required thing for… old people? Like, a check-up? Because I think I had one of those last year. Or was that the year before? It all blends together.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, I need you to focus. You’re here because an appointment was made. I am attempting to ascertain the reason for that appointment. “Old” is not a medical diagnosis. Have you noticed any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes…? Well, my knees… they don't bounce like they used to. And I get winded climbin’ stairs. That's new. Or maybe not new new. It’s been happenin’ for a while. I used to be able to… well, never mind. Doesn’t matter. And my memory… you seein’ that? It ain’t what it used to be. My ex-wife always said I was forgetful. She used to leave me notes. Lots of notes. Now, where was I? Oh, right. The appointment. Is this somethin’ I have to do? Medicare payin’ for this? I don’t wanna waste nobody’s time.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some shortness of breath and…memory issues. Any chest pain with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, ma'am. Not with the breathin’. Just feels… tight. Like someone’s sittin’ on my chest, but not painful. Just… uncomfortable. And I get dizzy sometimes. Not all the time. Usually when I stand up too fast. My ex-wife… she said I needed to drink more water. She was always tellin’ me somethin’. Honestly, I'm gettin’ a headache just tryin' to remember all this. Is it okay if I just sit here quietly for a minute? Maybe it'll come to me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your memory is not optimal, but I need something concrete. When did this dizziness start?
PATIENT: Concrete…? Like… cement? I ain’t done no construction work in years. But the dizziness… hmm. Let me think. It started… after the divorce, I think. Maybe. Or was it before? Everything kinda blurred together after she left. But it's been… a while. A good while. Maybe six months? A year? I really can't say for sure. It's not constant. It just happens… sometimes. When I get up quick. Or when I’m hot. Or… I don’t know. I really wish my ex-wife was here to answer these questions. She had a good memory. A very good memory.
DOCTOR: Right. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… I get kinda… shaky. In my hands. Not all the time, just… sometimes when I’m tryin’ to do somethin’ delicate. Like… buttonin’ a shirt. Or holdin’ a cup of coffee. And I get tired easily. Real easy. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now… I need a nap in the afternoon. A long nap. And sometimes, I get… confused. Like, I’ll walk into a room and forget what I went in there for. Or… I’ll be talkin’ to someone and forget what I was sayin’. Is that a symptom? It feels like… old age, if you wanna know the truth. That’s probably what it is. Old age creepin’ up on me. Is there a medicine for that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I am going to need to perform a brief physical examination to assess your condition. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Stand up…? Oh. Yes. I can do that. But be careful, alright? My knees ain’t what they used to be. And I might wobble a little. Don't want to fall and break somethin’. Is this part of the tryout? Like, seein’ if I’m still… agile? Because I haven’t done any stretchin’ lately. My ex-wife always told me I needed to stretch more. But I never listened to her.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure is 145/90. Heart rate is 88 and irregular. Breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally. Mild edema in the ankles. Reflexes are diminished. Gait is unsteady. Noticeable tremor in the hands. Alright, Mr. Bartok. Based on your symptoms and this brief examination, I recommend further testing. We'll need an EKG, a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. And I’m going to refer you to a cardiologist for evaluation of the irregular heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh, boy. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. Medicare coverin’ all that? I don't want to get stuck with a big bill. And a… what did you say? A cardiologist? Is that… a heart doctor? See, this is why I don’t like goin’ to doctors. It always turns into somethin’ big. My ex-wife, she always said I needed to take better care of myself. But I never did.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the necessary tests, Mr. Bartok. We will verify your coverage before proceeding. And yes, a cardiologist specializes in heart conditions. It's best to rule out any serious issues given your irregular heartbeat. I’m also going to prescribe a low-sodium diet and recommend you limit your caffeine intake. I'll have the nurse print out these referrals and diet instructions. Do you have any questions?
